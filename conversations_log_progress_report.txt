generator: **Feedback and Comments:**

1. **Task Response:**
   - Your essay has a clear position and supports that position with several arguments. However, the introduction and conclusion need more clarity and precision. Consider rephrasing the introduction to clearly state your disagreement directly, such as, "I strongly believe that academic qualifications are more important than social skills for job applicants."
   - In the conclusion, reiterate your main arguments briefly to reinforce your position.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - Your essay contains logical arguments, but transitions between ideas can be improved. Use cohesive devices to better link paragraphs and ideas. For example, in the second paragraph, instead of starting with "First of all," you might say "Firstly, a critical requirement for some professions is a relevant academic degree."
   - Also, ensure that each paragraph clearly leads to the next. Summarize the point of one paragraph before transitioning to another.

3. **Lexical Resource:**
   - There is some good use of vocabulary, but there are also several errors (e.g., "adventages" should be "advantages," "staffs" should be "staff"). 
   - Expand your vocabulary by incorporating synonyms and varying sentence structures. For example, instead of repeating "academic qualifications," you might use "educational background" or "academic credentials."

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
   - The essay has some grammatical inaccuracies (e.g., "This job could not tackle by the ones…" should be "This job cannot be tackled by those…"), and incorrect subject-verb agreements (e.g., "is one of the important skill" should be "is one of the important skills").
   - Try using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences to demonstrate a range of grammatical structures.
   - Proofread your work to fix grammatical errors, including articles ("the ones who" should be "those who") and plural forms ("skills" instead of "skill").

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**
- To improve your score, clarify your introduction and conclusion for stronger arguments. Refine your vocabulary by avoiding repetition and fixing spelling errors.
- Use more cohesive devices to connect your ideas smoothly. Ensure there is a clear line of thought from one sentence to the next and one paragraph to the following. For better grammatical accuracy, consider practicing with exercises targeting subject-verb agreement, tenses, and sentence structures.

**Overall Summary:**
Your essay demonstrates a good understanding of structuring arguments, but there is room for improvement in coherence, lexical accuracy, and grammatical precision. Focus on strengthening transitions between ideas and proofreading your work to reduce errors. By applying these suggestions, you will be closer to achieving your desired band score.
