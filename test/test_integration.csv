"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Interviews are commonly used as a way to screen candidates at large companies. However, some people argue that interviews are not an effective way to recruit employees. I agree that relying on interviews alone can sometimes lead to hiring the wrong candidate. However, I believe that when used in combination with other assessment methods, such as group activities and quizzes, interviews can be a valuable tool in the hiring process.

 

Organisations are increasingly using group activities to assess candidates' suitability for their roles. This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of candidates' values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.

 

Personality quizzes can be another useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses. Such tests can help to identify which candidates are naturally good mediators and which ones will require more direction from others. If one of the criteria for the role is to hire someone with strong leadership skills, then mediators may be the best option. 

 

Interviews are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to recruiting. While they can provide valuable insights into a candidate's qualifications, it's important to use other methods as well. This will help the company to validate the information provided by the candidate and make a more informed decision.  In the end, it's important to remember that no single method is perfect. Using a variety of methods will help to give you the best chance of finding the right candidate for the job.",6,6.5,"**Task Response:**

Your essay addresses the prompt effectively, providing a clear position on the use of interviews as a tool for recruitment and suggesting additional methods that complement interviews. However, to achieve a higher score, you should further elaborate your argument by providing more concrete examples or evidence to support your point of view. For example, you could reference specific industries or studies that have found success with using multiple assessment methods. This would strengthen your argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

Your essay is generally well-organized, with a clear structure and logical progression of ideas. Each paragraph is dedicated to a specific point. However, to enhance cohesion, consider using more linking words and phrases to show the progression and connection of ideas across paragraphs.

To boost your score in this area, try incorporating higher-level vocabulary and varied sentence structures to showcase a stronger command of English. Additionally, ensure that all terms are used accurately and with precision. You could explore synonyms for commonly used terms like ""candidates,"" ""assess,"" or ""method"" to demonstrate a diverse vocabulary.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

Your essay features fairly accurate grammar throughout, but there are opportunities to enhance the grammatical complexity. This includes using a wider variety of sentence structures, such as complex and compound-complex sentences, to add sophistication to your writing. Additionally, pay close attention to minor mistakes such as consistent verb tense usage and punctuation to ensure grammatical accuracy.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Strengthen your arguments by providing specific examples, evidence, or references.
2. Improve cohesion by using more linking words and phrases to connect ideas across paragraphs.

Focus on these areas in your revision to meet your desired score effectively.","Interviews have long been a cornerstone of the recruitment process for large companies worldwide. Nevertheless, a segment of people contends that interviews alone may not reliably determine the best candidate for a job. I am inclined to agree—to some extent—that relying solely on interviews could occasionally result in hiring the wrong individual. However, when interviews are used in conjunction with other evaluation tools like group exercises and psychological assessments, they become an invaluable component of hiring practices.

Firstly, interviews primarily focus on assessing individual skills and qualifications, but they often fall short in evaluating attributes crucial for teamwork and interpersonal relations. Companies increasingly employ group activities to gauge a candidate's ability to work under pressure, resolve conflicts, and communicate effectively within a team. These simulated scenarios offer insights beyond what a traditional one-on-one interview could provide. For instance, industries such as healthcare and sales heavily incorporate group assessments to measure candidates' collaborative spirit and leadership tendencies. This approach ensures that potential hires are well-rounded individuals who can adapt to dynamic work environments.

Additionally, psychological assessments such as personality quizzes are instrumental in unveiling a candidate's natural inclinations and areas necessitating development. For instance, individuals exhibiting strong mediation skills may excel in roles requiring diplomacy, whereas others displaying dominant traits might be better suited for leadership positions. In sectors like human resources or project management, selecting candidates with the right psychological makeup significantly impacts team dynamics and overall success.

Moreover, while interviews primarily target an applicant's past achievements and anticipated future contributions, aptitude tests cater to assessing skills vital for specific job roles. For instance, positions in engineering or information technology might require proficiency in particular software, which can be better evaluated through technical tests rather than standard interviews. By integrating these various assessment tools, companies can paint a comprehensive picture of each candidate, fostering informed hiring decisions.

In conclusion, interviews remain an important facet of the recruitment process, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate a candidate's fit for a role. However, I maintain that utilising a combination of interviews, group activities, and psychological or technical assessments enriches the hiring process. For companies striving to find the most suitable candidates, embracing this multifaceted approach can lead to a more effective recruitment strategy, minimising the likelihood of regrettable hiring choices.",8.0
Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give our opinion.,"Nature is considered as the integral part of the ecosystem. All living organisms relay on their habitants for survival. In recent times, every one on plant has faced consequences of nature such as climate change, most of the harm that's done to nature is caused by humans and as a result animals that depend on nature are facing problems. This topic has became highly debateable topic. In the following eassy I shall discuss my views and opinion and thus conclude with a possiable solution.

On the one hand, some people say that must of the harm is already done, and some rare plant and animal species are extient now, which in particularly plies to orchid plant and only grows in a rainforest and kiwi an animals that's alreday becaming endangered life which only eats plants and herbs.

On the other hand, some people say that it's not too late to take precautions and to control the damage by only swithching in to solar energy, which reduces the green house gas effects. Furthurmore, every one should be taught about recycling the waste rather than dumping in to rubbish which specillay includes plastic, which would effect the sea life. For instance, a documentary by National Georgraphic channel telecasted a program about the sea life, which shows that mammels  consider that thrash as food and eat them and die, due to digestion and the wastage becomes a topic, to eleborate there is a movie named Wall-e which has a message that earth would be evcuated because it's no longer suitable for human survival and all trees and animals become extent. In order to avoid this situation every one should be taught about the environment and how to protect it.

People should be educated to reduce the waste and also plant more plants, and also learn to protect the animal species. More over, in some countries have already taken a stand forward in doing public awarness, for example INDIA's prime minister has offically declared that any suburb that plants more trees, would be eligable for good tax benfits.

To conclude, people may vary in their opinion. I strongly believe that what happened is past, now every one should learn improtance of nature and animals species, this could be only done with the help of news and social awarness camps.",3,5.0,"**Feedback to Improve Essay:**

Some assert it's now too late to remedy this situation, while others remain optimistic that effective measures can reverse or at least mitigate such damage. This essay will explore both perspectives and provide my viewpoint on the matter.

To begin with, there is a camp that believes the damage inflicted by human actions is irreversible. This stance finds roots in the extinction of certain rare species. For example, historical development activities have led to the eradication of numerous orchid species, which thrived exclusively in rainforest ecosystems. Furthermore, the kiwi, a unique bird species in New Zealand, is on the brink of extinction due to habitat loss caused by human encroachment. Such examples reflect a pessimistic outlook suggesting we have reached a point beyond redemption.

In contrast, others believe it is still possible to address the negative effects through sustainable practices. One of the pivotal measures is the shift to renewable energy sources such as solar power, which significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, promoting recycling can play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. For instance, a documentary on the National Geographic Channel highlighted how plastic waste in oceans jeopardizes marine life, as sea creatures often ingest plastic unknowingly. Such events convey the urgent need for awareness and action. Furthermore, creative narratives, like the animated film Wall-e, envision a future where the Earth becomes uninhabitable due to environmental neglect, underlining the necessity of change today. Education about environmental conservation and responsible waste management can indeed foster a culture of sustainability.

In my opinion, while it's evident that considerable harm has already been done, it's not too late to take decisive action. Educating communities on the pressing need to protect ecosystems can drive meaningful change. Some governments, for instance, in India, have implemented initiatives to encourage afforestation by offering tax incentives for planting trees. Such policies indicate that through informed decisions and global effort, we can still conserve the remaining biodiversity and even bolster it.

In conclusion, varied opinions exist on the extent of human impact on nature, yet I firmly believe in the potential for recovery through concerted efforts. It is imperative now more than ever to renew our dedication to conserving plant and animal species to avert further irreversible damage.",8.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","The number of people who are interested in seeking the history of the building or house in some countries even increase. There are two reasons why society does it, and how they execute it. 

Firstly, avoiding any conflicts that are likely to happen in the future can be the main reason why people become interested to find out about the past. Nowadays, especially in villages, swindlers of landlords should be watched out to prevent problems. They usually offer lands that have no buildings on them to others who do not domicile in that village. The buyers are possibly to quarrel with the real owner later. Secondly, they want to check whether the house or building deserves to live. They are curious about the past story of the place. Sometimes, they also wonder about the myths of the building. 

In order to seek the history, buyer candidates are likely to ask the community around the building and check the legality of the document. Through the information gotten from the neighbours, they will get an insight into the story behind it. Since the neighbours are the closest parties, they know either the told or untold story around it. Also, they can check the official certificate. The cleverer buyer candidates will see this matter as prevention due to the existence of the swindlers. The certificate will tell who the legal owner of the building is. 

In conclusion, people are interested to find the history of a building to prevent problems that may come later and eliminate any hesitancy towards the building. Furthermore, they can do it by asking the neighbours and checking the legal document.",10,6.0,"Thank you for submitting your essay.

This phenomenon can be attributed to various motivations, and several reliable methods can be employed to conduct such research.

One of the primary reasons people become intrigued by the historical background of their properties is the desire to prevent future conflicts or legal disputes. For example, in areas where property ownership records are sometimes murky or misrepresented, knowing the history of a building can help avoid fraudulent transactions or claims by ensuring that the true ownership is well-documented. Moreover, the historical value of a property can significantly impact its financial investment potential. Homes or buildings with a rich historical background may appreciate in value, as they often attract a niche market that values historical significance.

In addition to financial and legal motivations, some individuals are driven by the aspiration to connect emotionally with their living spaces. Learning about the previous occupants, architectural changes, or cultural significance can foster a deeper appreciation and enrichment of one's living experience. Uncovering tales or mysteries surrounding a property can also fuel a sense of identity and continuity, weaving personal narratives into the broader historical tapestry of a neighborhood or community.

To explore the history of a building, individuals can begin by consulting public records, which often contain comprehensive documentation regarding property ownership, construction dates, and architectural alterations. Local libraries or historical societies may also offer archives, such as maps or photographs, delineating the evolution of a neighborhood. Additionally, speaking with long-standing residents or community elders can yield oral histories that provide unique insight beyond formal records. Online platforms and databases are now invaluable tools that offer digitized archives and forums where amateur historians can exchange findings and collaborate.

In conclusion, the interest in uncovering the history of one’s home or building is fueled by a blend of pragmatic and sentimental factors, ranging from legal assurance and investment potential to cultural and emotional connection. By leveraging diverse avenues of research, such as public records, local consultation, and digital resources, individuals can uncover the historical narratives that enrich their understanding and experience of their living surroundings. This pursuit not only safeguards their investments but also contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage, fostering a deeper connection to the past.",8.0
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.
Discuss both views and write your own opinion.","People have lots of standpoints whether the modern world makes us dependent on each other or it makes us more independent. While other people said this dependency has increased day by day, I believe that people are more monotonous and stronger these days. 

On the one hand, some people advocate that we are more dependent on each other because of modern technologies. Nowadays, the use of technologies has become convenient as it always provides the right solution and answers. So, people become more dependent on them. For example, if people have problems and difficulties, they start to find them on Google first. They do not try to solve the problems by themselves and depend on the internet. Moreover, due to the hectic and busy lives that most families lead, they are always dependent on each other to support them from head to toes even if they have minor problems.  For instance, the parents want to have a great family lifestyle and they have to work harder to fulfil this achievement. Therefore, they need  support from their grandparents for their children's care in order to concentrate on their work. 

On the other hand, technologies have developed day by day, people are more well-informed and open-minded thinking independently than in the past days. To illustrate, in the past days, the students need parents' help to fill the forms and other necessary things for enrolment for their schools. In this modern world, students can find those things on the internet and can do it well themself without  help from their parents. In addition, in the past, people usually get married around their twenty and even earlier. These days, people are likely to have an independent life and want to enjoy more single space before getting married.

To summarize, it is true that we do depend on others sometimes, however, we always solve our problems and are more independent in this modern world and experience a more thriving life which makes them more confident in their personality.",9,6.5,"Feedback:

1. Task Response:
   - The essay addresses both views on the topic, which is good. However, the expression ""people are more monotonous and stronger"" in the introduction is unclear. The term ""monotonous"" implies a lack of variety or excitement, which doesn't align with the argument of increased independence. Consider rephrasing to express your perspective more clearly. For example, you might state, ""I believe that modern advances have equipped people to be more self-reliant and resilient.""

2. Coherence and Cohesion:
   - The overall structure of the essay is logical, with different paragraphs dedicated to each viewpoint. However, smoother transitions between ideas and clearer linking phrases would enhance readability. Use phrases such as ""Additionally,"", ""Conversely,"", and ""However,"" to help guide the reader between points. Furthermore, the conclusion could more effectively synthesize the argumentative points by clearly restating how modern independence surpasses dependency, tying it back to your opinion.

3. Lexical Resource:
   - The essay demonstrates a reasonable vocabulary range, but certain phrases need refinement for clarity and precision. For instance, replace ""monotonous"" with more appropriate terms. Furthermore, explore synonyms and variations to avoid repetition, thereby enriching your language. For example, ""independent life"" can be varied with phrases like ""autonomous lifestyle.""

4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
   - While a variety of grammatical structures are used, accuracy can be improved. For instance, correct pronoun use is crucial, as seen in ""do it well themself,"" which should read ""do it well themselves."" Ensuring subject-verb agreement and consistency in tense will also improve clarity. Practice constructing complex sentences but ensure they remain easy to follow.

Overall Suggestions and Improvements:
- Clearly define and maintain your main opinion, ensuring it aligns with the arguments presented in your essay.
- Strengthen coherence by utilizing more transitional phrases and linking words to seamlessly guide the reader through your thoughts.
- Expand your lexical variety: find precise synonyms for overused or incorrect terms to enhance clarity and interest.
- Focus on the grammatical accuracy, such as correct pronoun use and consistent subject-verb agreement, to convey your points effectively.

Overall Summary:
To reach a score of 8.0, strive for a clear, cohesive, and well-argued essay. Ensure your stated opinion is logical and consistently supported by your arguments. By refining coherence, expanding your vocabulary, and enhancing grammatical precision, your essay will reflect the sophistication and skill characteristic of a higher band score. Aim for clarity and precision in every aspect to effectively communicate your perspective.","In today's interconnected world, there is ongoing debate about whether modern advancements have led to increased interdependence among individuals or promoted greater independence. While some argue that reliance on others has intensified, I contend that contemporary innovations have equipped individuals to be more self-reliant and capable of handling their affairs independently.

On one hand, it is argued that modern technologies have fostered a greater degree of dependency among people. The ease and convenience offered by technological solutions often lead individuals to rely on them rather than devising their resolutions. For instance, search engines like Google provide quick answers to various problems, encouraging a tendency to depend on digital resources for solutions rather than relying on personal judgment and critical thinking. Moreover, the demands of modern lifestyles necessitate support networks within families. Parents frequently turn to extended family members, such as grandparents, to care for their children while they focus on professional commitments. This creates a web of dependence, even for functions that were traditionally managed independently.

Conversely, the development of technology and increased access to information has also fostered a sense of independence that was previously unattainable. With the advent of the internet, individuals, especially students, are more empowered to manage tasks such as school applications and form submissions independently, without parental assistance. Furthermore, societal norms have evolved, and people now embrace autonomy in various aspects of their lives, such as delaying marriage to enjoy individual freedom and personal growth before committing to lifelong partnerships. This shift towards autonomy allows for a broader experience of self-sufficiency that contrasts sharply with the traditional dependence on family and societal structures.

In summary, while modern advancements have created scenarios where people appear to rely more on each other, the same developments have simultaneously paved the way for unprecedented independence. Technologies and societal changes have endowed individuals with resources and an environment conducive to self-directed living, ultimately fostering a robust sense of autonomy that often surpasses their dependence on others. Therefore, I firmly believe that the contemporary world has made individuals more independent while still providing the option to interconnect when necessary.",8.0
"some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. to what extent do you agree or disagree.","Climate development is the greatest threat to human life on earth. However, some people consider that instead of averting it, we should find a way to adapt to it.  Although there are convincing statements  on both sides, i believe that we still have to tackle this issue.

One of the main causes of temperature change is global warming. If both the government and people can take reasonable actions, this can be well controlled. For instance, the government can stop the generation of power from fossil fuels, which causes the emission of carbon and can be detrimental to the society. Also, the government can implement green taxes on industries that emit carbon-di-oxide, and invest in other renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Furthermore, individuals can try to limit their carbon footprint by flying less and using public transport.

Trying to live with climate revolution is a very dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming, the polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. Provided that there is an increase water sea level, natural disasters like flooding and drought are likely to occur. As a result, this will make people lose their homes and perhaps migrate to another country.

In conclusion,  weather diversity is becoming a pressing issue, I reiterate my opinion that there are different ways of tackling this problem by creating a new source of power and using less vehicles. Therefore, both the government and people have a role to play.",7,7.0,"Feedback:

While some argue that humanity should learn to coexist with the changes, I firmly believe that prioritizing the prevention of climate change remains crucial. However, understanding both perspectives is essential to addressing this multifaceted problem comprehensively.

Proponents of adapting to climate change often highlight the immediate need to face the current environmental alterations. They argue that with certain levels of climate change being inevitable, resources should be allocated to developing adaptive strategies, such as infrastructure resilient to extreme weather conditions and innovations in agriculture suited to changing climates. For example, coastal cities could invest in constructing flood defenses to manage rising sea levels, ensuring that communities remain safe and sustainable in the face of climatic shifts.

Nonetheless, focusing solely on adaptation neglects the core issue: the ongoing acceleration of climate change due to human activities. The root cause must be addressed to prevent more severe and irreversible consequences in the future. Governments and individuals hold the power to make meaningful changes. Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources not only limits greenhouse gas emissions but also opens economic opportunities in burgeoning green industries. Introducing stricter regulations and incentives for industries can drive innovation toward more sustainable practices, ultimately reducing the carbon footprint on a larger scale.

Furthermore, neglecting preventative measures could lead to dire societal repercussions. Without active intervention, global warming may result in more frequent natural disasters, loss of biodiversity, and the displacement of millions of people, aggravating global inequality and scarcity of resources. These challenges underscore the importance of immediate prevention strategies alongside adaptive methods to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations.

In conclusion, while adaptation provides a pragmatic solution to existing climate changes, prevention must remain at the forefront to halt their escalation. By jointly addressing both aspects, humanity can design a comprehensive approach that mitigates current challenges and safeguards our planet's future. It is imperative that governments, industries, and individuals collaborate to forge pathways toward a sustainable and climate-resilient world.",8.0
"Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is argued by many people that history contains the lessons to help us understand human's life while others believe that we can hardly learn anything from the past. It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.
Some people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.
It is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.

Some contend that history is an invaluable repository of information that enhances our understanding of humanity, whereas others argue that progress renders past lessons obsolete. In my view, history provides essential insights that contribute to human development. This essay will explore both perspectives and provide a comprehensive examination of this multifaceted topic.

Those who argue against the value of history suggest that the unprecedented pace of technological advancement in contemporary society often overshadows historical precedents. For instance, the rapid evolution of communication technologies has transformed interactions in ways that historical contexts may seem irrelevant. Despite this perspective, it is also evident that understanding previous technological failures and successes can inform the development of new innovations. Therefore, while the historical framework may appear outdated amid modern advancements, it holds indirect relevance by providing cautionary tales and foundational knowledge necessary for progression.

Conversely, proponents of history as a crucial repository argue that it is not only the lessons from past technological advancements but also cultural and intellectual heritage that shape the ethos of societies. For instance, understanding the causes and consequences of historical events such as World Wars can hone our insights into contemporary geopolitical tensions. Similarly, abiding by the social ideologies and philosophies derived from predecessors, societies can avoid repeating past mistakes and make informed decisions. Moreover, cultural histories contribute to a society’s identity and unity, underpinning core values and beliefs handed down through generations.

Additionally, history equips us with philosophical understanding and enhances our cognitive capacity to navigate intricate human interactions and conflicts. By studying historical patterns and philosophies, individuals can develop a profound sense of empathy and enhance their spiritual intellect. For example, learning about the civil rights movements can not only inspire future generations to pursue equality but also educate people on complex social justice issues.

In summary, while some may claim that history is of limited significance due to rapid societal advancements, it remains a crucial archive that underscores both technological advancements and cultural wisdom. The nuanced appreciation of history, therefore, empowers us to leverage these insights towards a prosperous future. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of history and its profound lessons is indispensable for holistic human progress.",8.0

This burgeoning interest can be attributed to a number of fascinating reasons that transcend mere curiosity, ranging from unraveling the architectural narrative to enhancing property value. In this essay, I will discuss these motivations and explore various methods people use to delve into the past of their residences.

Firstly, understanding the historical context of one's home can provide a profound sense of connection and identity. Many people wish to uncover the cultural or historical significance embedded in their living spaces. For instance, homes constructed during specific periods—such as Victorian or Edwardian—carry unique architectural legacies that reveal much about the era's design preferences and societal norms. Unveiling these details can offer residents a deeper appreciation for their residence's aesthetic and historical value.

Moreover, heritage investigation can shed light on ownership lineage or noteworthy events that transpired on the property, fostering a personal connection to the past. Knowing that one's home was part of a significant historical event or owned by a prominent figure can increase its sentimental and monetary value. The potential for restoration projects to reflect original designs also piques interest among those interested in preserving historical integrity.

To research the history of their homes, individuals have several resources at their disposal. Libraries and local archives often house a wealth of historical documents, including censuses, maps, and deeds, which can provide valuable insights into a property's past. Engaging with historical societies or local historians can also be particularly enlightening, as these experts can offer context and detailed narratives.

In addition, digital platforms have revolutionized access to historical data. Websites dedicated to genealogy and ancestry research frequently offer records that can assist individuals in tracing property lineage and previous owners. These resources are invaluable in painting a comprehensive picture of a household's historical backdrop.

Finally, engaging with the community can yield informative and sometimes surprising details. Conversations with long-term neighborhood residents can unveil anecdotal stories and folklore, offering a more personal touch to the historical exploration.

In conclusion, the quest to uncover the history of our homes satisfies a blend of personal and practical interests, from appreciating architectural styles to enhancing property value. Through libraries, digital resources, and community engagement, residents can piece together the intricate tales of their living spaces, enriching both their knowledge and connection to their heritage.",8.0

While some argue that legislative intervention is essential for the wellbeing of a nation's population, others contend that dietary choices should remain a matter of personal responsibility and freedom. This essay will delve into both perspectives before outlining my own stance on this important issue.

On the one hand, advocates for government-imposed regulations highlight the potential benefits of having laws that ensure the availability and consumption of wholesome food. By setting strict guidelines on ingredients such as sugar and saturated fats, policymakers could effectively curb unhealthy eating habits that lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. For instance, Japan has successfully implemented laws that limit the sugar content in beverages like soda, resulting in a marked improvement in public health indicators such as obesity rates and overall life expectancy. The argument here is that, much like seatbelt laws or anti-smoking legislation, enforcing healthy eating practices can protect individuals from harming themselves through poor dietary choices.

Conversely, those in favor of individual autonomy assert that people should have the freedom to choose their food based on personal preferences and lifestyle needs. Personal responsibility plays a crucial role in empowering citizens to make informed decisions about what they consume. Many argue that government intervention could infringe on personal rights and lead to a one-size-fits-all approach that disregards individual dietary requirements. For example, a high-protein diet may be beneficial to an athlete but unnecessary for someone with a sedentary lifestyle. Personal choice acknowledges this diversity and allows people to tailor their eating habits accordingly.

In my opinion, while the government should play a role in promoting public health by raising awareness and providing education about nutrition, it should not go so far as to dictate dietary choices through laws. Instead of imposing mandates, the focus should be on fostering a culture of informed decision-making, where individuals are both educated and encouraged to consume healthy foods. By striking a balance between regulation and freedom, society can ensure that citizens are protected without infringing upon personal rights.

In conclusion, both governmental laws on nutritious food and individual responsibility have roles to play in enhancing public health. A dual approach that combines education and empowerment with selective regulation could be most effective. By doing so, we can achieve a healthier society without compromising the fundamental right of personal choice.",8.0

This curiosity can be attributed to a number of compelling reasons, and there are several effective methodologies for researching a building's history.

Firstly, a deep fascination with historical narratives often drives people to explore their homes' past. Understanding the stories and events connected to a building helps residents feel more connected to their environment. For example, learning that a house was once a hub for significant events or home to a notable figure can imbue a sense of pride and other sentimental value. Such knowledge not only enhances the home’s allure but also elevates its perceived value and prestige within the community.

Furthermore, with the plethora of media, especially horror films, exploring haunted houses or mysterious pasts, many individuals are propelled by the thrill of mystery. There is a desire to ensure that the home carries no ominous past that could affect its current ambiance. Moreover, in some cultures, superstitions and beliefs play a crucial role; thus, knowing whether any tragic incidents occurred may influence whether one decides to live in or purchase a particular property.

For some, understanding the architectural value and the craftsmanship of older buildings is of academic or artistic interest. Many traditional structures possess unique architectural features lost in modern architecture. Delving into their history can reveal valuable insights about building materials, techniques, and aesthetic preferences of bygone eras.

Researching the history of a building can be approached in several ways. One of the oldest and most reliable methods is consulting local archives or libraries, where property records, historical maps, and past census data are stored. These documents can offer a wealth of authentic information regarding previous owners, structural changes, and even historical photographs. Additionally, online databases and digital archives have made access to such resources easier and more comprehensive.

Another method might involve speaking with older long-term residents or local historians who may have personal anecdotes or information. These people, having witnessed changes over time, can provide invaluable first-hand accounts of significant events or transformations related to the property or neighborhood. Moreover, engaging with local historical societies or preservation groups can also shed light on a building's history, as they often maintain records and conduct research into valuable properties.

While some argue that it is a time-consuming activity with little practical value, I firmly believe that the news plays a significant role in enlightening, educating, and connecting individuals with society. This essay will evaluate the importance of news in contemporary life and argue against the idea that engaging with news is a waste of time.

To begin with, news serves as a crucial source of information that keeps us updated about important events locally and globally. It provides citizens with knowledge about government decisions, international affairs, and major developments affecting society, which in turn enables individuals to make informed life decisions and participate actively in democratic processes. For example, during election periods, news outlets provide comprehensive coverage of candidates' policies and performance, aiding voters in making informed choices.

Furthermore, news plays a vital role in shaping public opinion and promoting cultural awareness. Media platforms highlight diverse cultural events, social movements, and heritage celebrations, fostering a sense of global citizenship and understanding. By staying aware of happenings around the world, individuals can develop a broader perspective, appreciate cultural diversity, and engage meaningfully in cross-cultural discourse.

Additionally, news is crucial for public safety and awareness. Reports on natural disasters, health updates during pandemics, and weather forecasts help communities stay prepared and take necessary precautions to minimize risks and safeguard their well-being. Instantaneous updates from trusted news sources can be life-saving, as they provide timely guidance during emergencies.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all news content is beneficial, as some may lead to misinformation and unnecessary stress. With the proliferation of digital media, distinguishing between factual news and sensationalized stories requires critical media literacy. Therefore, individuals must consume news judiciously, relying on reputable sources that maintain journalistic integrity.

In conclusion, despite its potential downsides, news is fundamentally connected to people's lives, continually influencing and informing daily decisions. Its ability to empower individuals with knowledge, enhance cultural understanding, and ensure public safety cannot be understated.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many staffs hold the belief that academic qualifications are less essential than social skills in terms of job applications. I would argue that I fully disagree with this motion due to some reasons.

First of all, there are some jobs that require applicants with a relevant academic degree to fulfil the position especially medical doctor, pharmacist, naval engineer, and many other jobs. These professions have a great responsibility and high complexity. For example, doctors have to make a diagnosis of the patients and then make a medical prescription. This job could not tackle by the ones who do not have  special qualifications and formal degrees in medical doctors. The applicants who do not have medical qualifications would give a wrong diagnosis and prescription to the patient.

Secondly, academic qualifications would give adventages to solve the jobs. Academic qualifications come with specific knowledge for example applicants from industrial engineering backgrounds would have some knowledge in financial analysis, market analysis, risk analysis, production process design, factory layout design and many other skills. All of these skills could help the applicants to make a good feasibility study report. Some skills might  learn through discussion with other competent and experienced staff, but it would take a long time and undetailed.

Thirdly, social skill is one of the important skill in  working life, but they could overweight the role of academic qualifications. Some jobs could not be solved through negotiation and discussion.

This shows an awareness of the complexities of the topic and provides a balanced perspective.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**
   - The structure of your essay is logical, with clear paragraphing. However, the essay could benefit from smoother transitions between ideas.

3. **Lexical Resource**

Some employers prioritize social skills over formal academic credentials, but I firmly believe that both aspects play crucial roles in an individual's professional success. While academic qualifications provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills necessary for specialized roles, social skills complement this expertise by facilitating effective interpersonal interaction and collaboration within the workplace. 

To begin with, academic qualifications remain indispensable for specific professions requiring a high level of expertise and responsibility. For instance, roles such as medical doctors, architects, and engineers demand a profound understanding of theoretical and technical knowledge that can only be acquired through rigorous academic training. Doctors, for example, must have an extensive background in medical sciences to accurately diagnose and treat patients, a task that could not be entrusted to individuals without the proper qualifications. Hence, academic credentials serve as a testament to an applicant's competence and ability to handle complex tasks.

Nevertheless, social skills should not be underestimated in their impact on workplace dynamics. Effective communication, teamwork, and networking skills are integral to any professional environment, as they enhance collaboration and the seamless exchange of ideas. The ability to negotiate, manage conflicts, and build relationships is crucial for fostering a cooperative atmosphere and ensuring the smooth operation of organizational processes. In roles that hinge on customer interaction or collaborative projects, such as sales executives or project managers, social skills become an invaluable asset that bolsters job performance.

Despite the emphasis placed on social skills, there are certain job functions that cannot rely solely on interpersonal capabilities. Technical roles, such as data analysts and software developers, require specialization in specific tools and methodologies. For instance, big data analysis necessitates proficiency in relevant software and coding languages, competencies acquired through formal education, which social skills alone cannot replace. Thus, while social skills enrich professional environments, they cannot overshadow the importance of academic qualifications for specialized roles.

In conclusion, both academic qualifications and social skills are pivotal for job applicants. Academic credentials provide the foundational knowledge essential for performing specialized tasks, while social skills enhance workplace interactions and foster collaboration. Consequently, a balanced consideration of both aspects ought to guide employers in their hiring processes, acknowledging that each plays a vital role in contributing to a productive and harmonious work environment.",8.0

Parents are the first persons who spend more time with children than anyone else.So,during the course of childhood,if parents are telling the stories taking some time out from their other work,children will be motivated towards the good manners and they will carry it when they grow.As we know,the first impression is the best impression.Furthermore,apart from  morality,the bond between the parents and children will become very strong which creates a lot of positivity in the children.For example,students who spent their childhood with parents behave well in school and on the other hand,youngers who did not spend their time with their parents act oddly.

It is also argued that,nowadays,children are capable enough to manage their work,including,reading books,watching television of their choice like cartoons or movies.If the parental impact is missing then it may lead to several negative ways on the children.In other words,children give importance to television than parents.For an instance,a past survey,reveals that more than 60 percent of children prefer to spend their time in front of the televison by enjoying their favourite program than seeing their mother or father.

In a conclusion,parents killing time with the children is very important for their children personal growth rather than allowing them to do their activities of their own.It is also suggested that,the more time parents spend with children in teaching them stories,the more good manners their children learn.",5,6.5,"**Feedback and Comments:**

While both perspectives hold valid points, a balanced approach could yield the most beneficial outcomes for children's development.

On one hand, proponents of parental storytelling argue that parents play a crucial role as the primary teachers of morality and social behavior. When parents share stories with their children, they pass on cultural values, good manners, and important life lessons. This bonding time can strengthen the emotional connection between parent and child, fostering a positive atmosphere that supports emotional and social development. For instance, children who have grown up listening to stories narrated by their parents tend to develop better interpersonal skills, as they have internalized values and lessons imparted through these interactions. Moreover, such activities can significantly bolster a child's imaginative capabilities and instill a love for reading from an early age.

Conversely, some believe that children are perfectly capable of exploring literature and media on their own. With access to books, television programs, and movies, children can choose materials that resonate with their personal interests. This autonomy can foster independence and self-directed learning, which are crucial skills in a rapidly changing world. However, without parental guidance, children might not discern between content that is beneficial and that which is not. An overreliance on digital media might expose them to inappropriate content, potentially leading to adverse effects such as reduced attention spans or diminished social interaction skills.

In my view, while children do possess the capacity to explore literature and media on their own, the involvement of parents is indispensable. By actively participating in storytelling, parents can not only oversee the quality of content their children are exposed to but also add a personal touch that digital media lacks. Additionally, by integrating their guidance with opportunities for independent exploration, parents can encourage both structured learning and personal growth in their children. 

In conclusion, the strategy of combining parental involvement with autonomous exploration allows children to benefit from the richness of both worlds. Parents should indeed read or tell stories to their children, reinforcing family bonds and teaching essential life lessons, while also allowing children the freedom to pursue their interests through various media. This holistic approach can enrich the cognitive and emotional development of children, preparing them well for future challenges.",8.0
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In the contemporary era, thanks to numerous technological advancements, many academic establishments have been offering digital courses as an alternative to conventional classes at school. From my perspective, this is primarily a positive phenomenon despite some drawbacks.

On the one hand, what should be carefully considered is the efficiency of digital courses. If students enrol in online lectures at open places such as coffee shops, they will be easily distracted by extrinsic factors. Hence, they might not fully comprehend these lectures. Moreover, some soft skills, such as communication skills or teamwork, might be best trained and practised in person. Therefore, when they do not attend physical classes, such skills do not seem to be effectively enhanced. Eventually, virtual courses might be potentially detrimental to learning efficiency.

On the other hand, online courses are beneficial for both learners and universities. First and foremost, students can effortlessly access reading references and online lectures with electronic devices connected to the Internet. Hence, they can actively schedule their timetable and learn wherever they wish; for instance, some might want to study at a coworking space which can foster their creativity. Additionally, universities could also optimize their operation cost by curtailing the budgets used for basic commodities served on campus. Expenditures on electricity or water could be taken as prime examples. Ultimately, digital studying programs are likely to facilitate enrollment in higher education among students and optimize budgets for education systems.

In conclusion, virtual study is an inevitable trend in today’s world, especially with the boom of advanced technologies. Regardless of some minus points, I do advocate that it can be deemed largely positive regarding how it encourages studying attendance and allows universities to implant optimization schemes.",8,7.5,"**Feedback and Evaluation**

Keep writing and practicing these strategies to reach your target.","In recent years, many universities around the world have embraced the opportunity to offer online courses as alternatives to traditional campus-based education. This shift has sparked a debate on whether such development is beneficial. While acknowledging some potential downsides, I believe that the positive impact of online courses significantly outweighs any negatives.

To begin with, it is crucial to address some of the concerns regarding the efficacy of online learning. Critics often argue that remote education might expose students to distractions, especially when studying in informal environments like coffee shops. This could hinder their ability to fully engage with the material, potentially affecting comprehension. Additionally, certain soft skills—such as effective communication and teamwork—often prosper in interactive, in-person settings. The limited face-to-face interaction in virtual classes might impede the development of these essential skills.

Despite these drawbacks, the advantages of online courses are substantial and convincing. Firstly, they democratize education by providing students worldwide with access to high-quality resources and lectures from renowned institutions, merely by connecting to the Internet. This convenience allows learners to tailor their study schedules to fit their personal and professional lives, thereby accommodating various learning paces and styles. For instance, those with part-time jobs can effortlessly incorporate learning into their daily routines without compromising their employment commitments.

Beyond individual benefits, online courses also represent a cost-effective solution for educational institutions. Universities can considerably lower their operational expenses by reducing necessities such as physical infrastructure and facility maintenance, channeling these savings into further enhancing educational quality and developing more sophisticated platforms for their digital offerings. With this strategic allocation of resources, institutions can optimally serve more students without geographical constraints and mitigate economic barriers to education access.

In summary, while online courses may present some challenges regarding engagement and skill development, these are considerably overshadowed by the transformative benefits they offer. They not only provide convenient, flexible learning opportunities for students but also enable universities to operate more efficiently and inclusively. This progression in the educational landscape is a commendable advancement spurred by modern technology, fostering a future where education becomes more accessible and adaptable for all.",8.0
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Owing to the advancement of technology, more and more educational institutuions are offering online courses. As a result, students are given additional freedom in different aspects. In this essay, I will elaborate on why I believe that this is a positive development and outline main benefits.

To begin with, the opportunity to attend lectures on the internet platforms istead of inperosn, contributes to a solution of the main struggle of nearly every student, financial strain. Namely, having classes on campus is followed by few costs which can be easily avoided by simply staying at home, including all transportation fees and expenses of eating out for instance. This may seem insignificant, but when compounded, it usually cause headaches to both, pupils and families. Hence, without a need to visit a university, student might save a considerable sum of money on a yearly basis. 

Moreover, attending educational institution is frequently highly time consuming, especially for the learners who live further away. Not only the transportation can take you a lot of time but it leaves you  nearly none freedom for the time management. In other words, opportunity to organise your day to a little detail, including meal breaks, lecture time or leisure activities, leads to higher productivity and consequently more free time. Therefore, the less strict the time-table is, the more enjoyable the individual will find studying.

In conlusion,  I am of the opinion that off campus education is strongly advantageous and thus the positive development. Hopefully, more universities will offer such programmes in the near future.",4,7.0,"Thank you for your essay. You have made a compelling argument in favor of online courses as a positive development.

Keep practicing, and you will surely elevate your writing skills!","With the rapid advancement of technology, an increasing number of universities are opting to provide online courses as an alternative to traditional in-person classes. In my view, this development is overwhelmingly positive due to the economic and time-related benefits it offers to learners. This essay will discuss these advantages while acknowledging some potential drawbacks.

First and foremost, online courses alleviate the financial burden associated with attending classes on-campus. Conventional education necessitates various expenditures such as transportation, accommodation, and meals outside the home, necessitating a substantial portion of a student's budget. By eliminating the need for daily commuting or relocating to campus, students and their families can save significant amounts of money. Consequently, online learning renders higher education more accessible to students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, enriching the academic community with varied perspectives and experiences.

Secondly, the flexibility of online courses significantly enhances a student's ability to manage their time efficiently. Students who live far from campus no longer need to spend valuable hours commuting, allowing them to allocate more time to their studies, extracurricular interests, or part-time jobs. This flexibility fosters improved productivity by enabling students to tailor their daily schedules to their personal preferences and learning styles. Consequently, individuals find their educational experience more enjoyable and less constrained, promoting a more harmonious balance between academic obligations and personal life.

Despite these significant benefits, it is essential to consider potential downsides. Critics of online education often cite reduced social interaction as a limitation, arguing that in-person classes provide unique opportunities for students to forge meaningful relationships and develop essential social skills. However, with the integration of collaborative platforms and virtual group activities, many online courses now facilitate interaction among participants, effectively mitigating this concern.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the emergence of online courses represents a positive development in higher education. While it is crucial to address minor challenges related to social engagement, the ability to reduce financial strain and optimize time management outweighs these concerns. By embracing this format, universities can extend their reach and better accommodate the diverse needs of contemporary students.",8.0
"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In today's ,world social skills are given utmost importance over the educational background and many of the recruiters try to employ candidates with such qualities.  I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.

In contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.

In conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.",8,6.5,"**Task Response:**

Your essay provides a reasonable response to the task prompt by discussing both the importance of social skills and academic qualifications in the employment context. However, to reach a higher band score, consider addressing the question more directly at the beginning of your essay by stating your position definitively (either agree or disagree) and ensuring each paragraph consistently relates back to your thesis. Additionally, you could explore more specific scenarios where one skill set might be more applicable than the other, offering a nuanced perspective.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

Overall, your essay has clear organization and logical progression. However, to enhance coherence, use more explicit linking words or phrases within and between paragraphs to guide the reader. For example, transitions such as ""Moreover,"" ""Conversely,"" or ""On the other hand,"" could be used to smooth transitions between points and improve the flow. Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that aligns with your thesis and elaborates on the main argument.

**Lexical Resource:**

Your vocabulary demonstrates a good range, but to achieve a higher score, aim to showcase more varied and precise vocabulary. Try to substitute repetitive terms with synonyms or related phrases. For instance, replace ""communication skills"" with terms like ""interpersonal abilities"" or ""verbal proficiency"" to demonstrate lexical flexibility.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

Your essay contains mostly accurate grammar, but there are occasional errors in sentence structure and punctuation that can be addressed to enhance clarity. For instance, remove unnecessary commas, e.g. ""In today's ,world"" should be ""In today's world,"" and ensure subject-verb agreement is correct in all instances. Additionally, vary the sentence structures more by including complex and compound sentences to showcase a wider grammatical range.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Begin with a clear thesis statement that takes a definitive position on the prompt and reflects your unique argument.
2. Strengthen the connections between ideas with a variety of linking words to improve coherence.
3. Expand your lexical resource by incorporating more diverse and precise vocabulary throughout the essay.
4. Check for grammatical errors and strive to use a range of sentence structures.

**Overall Summary:**

Your essay provides a solid foundation for the discussion of the importance of social skills and academic qualifications. By more clearly articulating your position, enhancing coherence with improved transitions, expanding vocabulary, and ensuring grammatical accuracy, you can elevate your essay to reach your desired score of 8.0. Keep practicing and integrating these elements to develop an articulate and compelling argument.","In contemporary employment contexts, the debate over whether social skills or academic qualifications are more critical for job applicants has garnered substantial attention. While some employers prioritize interpersonal abilities, others underscore the paramount importance of academic prowess. From my perspective, I hold the belief that social skills are indeed more vital than academic qualifications for most jobs. Nonetheless, the significance of both cannot be understated as they contribute complementarily to a candidate's overall effectiveness in the workplace.

The primary reason I advocate for the prominence of social skills lies in their indispensable role in workplace interpersonal dynamics. Good communication and interpersonal abilities are vital for building rapport among team members, forging strong relationships with clients, and facilitating smooth interactions within a corporate setting. For instance, a salesperson with excellent negotiation skills and the ability to connect with customers on a personal level is more likely to close deals and drive sales than one with merely a theoretical understanding of marketing principles. Additionally, effective collaboration, which is pivotal for success in diverse working environments, is largely contingent upon one's capacity to communicate, empathize, and cooperate with others.

Moreover, social skills extend beyond just verbal communication. They encompass emotional intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. Employees who can efficiently handle workplace conflicts, navigate through challenges, and exhibit resilience under pressure are often the backbone of any successful organization. Employers increasingly seek candidates who can not only execute tasks effectively but also maintain a positive and encouraging work environment.

Conversely, it would be a gross oversight to diminish the value of academic qualifications entirely. Certain professions, particularly those in technical, medical, or scientific fields, necessitate a foundational understanding of complex concepts that academic education uniquely provides. For example, a surgeon requires profound academic knowledge and expertise to perform successfully. Here, the depth of learning one undergoes in their educational journey is non-negotiable as it ensures competence in specialized domains.

In conclusion, while academic qualifications lay the groundwork for vocational knowledge, it is predominantly the social skills that equip individuals to apply this knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios. Therefore, an ideal candidate for most positions is one who harmoniously blends robust interpersonal abilities with requisite academic proficiency. In a world where teamwork and customer relations often determine business success, it is clear that social skills carry a slight edge, reasserting their paramount importance in today’s job market.",8.0

Environmental degradation and inadequate housing are significant contributors to public health issues, and addressing these can lead to substantial improvements in community well-being.

First and foremost, environmental pollution is a critical factor in the development of various health problems. Air and water pollution are known to cause a wide range of illnesses, from respiratory ailments to more severe diseases such as cancer. For instance, smog and vehicle emissions in urban areas have been directly linked to increased asthma rates among children and adults. By implementing stricter regulations on emissions and promoting sustainable practices, governments can reduce the prevalence of pollution-related health risks.

Furthermore, housing conditions have a profound impact on an individual's health. Substandard housing, often characterized by inadequate insulation, poor ventilation, and overcrowding, can exacerbate health problems such as allergies, infectious diseases, and mental health disorders. The government can play a pivotal role by ensuring access to affordable, quality housing through urban planning and housing policies. Improving living conditions not only supports physical health but also enhances mental well-being by creating a safer and more stable living environment.

Additionally, focusing on these areas can lead to long-term economic benefits. While initial investments may be substantial, the resultant decrease in healthcare costs due to a healthier population would be significant. Preventing diseases and health issues through environmental and housing improvements can ultimately reduce the burden on healthcare systems, allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently.

In conclusion, it is imperative that governments concentrate on reducing environmental pollution and resolving housing problems to prevent illnesses and diseases. Such actions not only improve public health and quality of life but also lead to economically sustainable societies. Hence, prioritizing these areas is both a practical and ethical responsibility for governments worldwide.",8.0
Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, it seems more important for employers to consider the job applicant’s social skills before their academic records. In my opinion, I strongly disagree as not always good social skills are enough to complete a task satisfactorily, as well as having academic qualifications are not a guarantee of dealing with the job appropriately. I believe that the combination of both aspects should be the best criterion in order to select an employee.

To begin with, employing people based only on their social skills would probably be insufficient as they may not be well prepared to do the job. For instance, it has been claimed that, far away from being overrated, university studies are necessary for  society as many people are being formed in short Online courses trying to take faster paths to get a job while the truth is that 90% of them fail getting hired as they profiles are not enough to deal with all the situations of qualified jobs. This means that it is absolutely necessary having reliable qualifications that allow one to work professionally. However, I am not saying that only  academic records are enough, we all definitely need to have acceptable social skills if we really want to succeed in a working environment.

On the other hand, considering the other extreme of only taking into account their academic records it also does not guarantee successful employment. For example, it has been proved that numerous business sales with competent personnel that were not kind enough at the time of dealing with people, were losing sales dropping their numbers considerably. This explains why it is important to understand that qualifications and social skills contribute equally to the performance of  a better job.

In conclusion, employers who think that it is preferable having great social skills than to have professional skills are wrong, as considering one on top of the other, no matter which one is,  would decline in failure as both are truly important. In my opinion, I strongly believe that employers should consider both aspects in order to choose the best candidates,  which the criteria would be performing a good job while using their social abilities to interact with other employees and clients, working naturally as a part of a team.",9,6.5,"**Task Response:**

I fundamentally disagree with the notion that social skills outweigh academic qualifications, asserting instead that both elements are equally pivotal in determining a candidate's suitability for a job. By considering specific scenarios, it becomes evident that a combination of both skills often results in successful job performance.

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that possessing social skills alone may not suffice when performing complex job tasks. Many roles require technical expertise and a comprehensive understanding of specific fields, which can be best attained through formal education. For instance, in professions such as engineering or medicine, theoretical and practical knowledge is indispensable. A surgeon, no matter how socially adept, cannot rely solely on interpersonal skills to conduct a successful operation. Thus, academic qualifications provide a fundamental base for professional competence.

Conversely, solely relying on academic qualifications without evaluating an individual's social abilities can also lead to workforce inefficiency. In roles that require team collaboration or direct interaction with clients, interpersonal skills are critical. A customer service representative, for example, must handle inquiries and complaints diplomatically to ensure customer satisfaction and business retention. Statistics from the Harvard Business Review indicate that companies with employees who have strong social skills exhibit a 20% increase in client retention, underscoring the practical importance of these abilities.

Moreover, in today's dynamic work environment, the integrated application of both skills tends to yield optimal results. Consider the case of Steve Jobs, a visionary who combined his technical intellect with exceptional social prowess to revolutionize the tech industry. His ability to present ideas captivatingly and inspire teams was as crucial to his success as his technical acumen. Such examples highlight that the synergy of social skills and academic knowledge can drive both individual and organizational success.

In conclusion, it is a misconception to place social skills above academic qualifications or vice versa in the hiring process. Both elements are vital in cultivating a competent and versatile workforce. Employers should aim to identify candidates who exhibit a balance of both, thereby ensuring that employees are not only knowledgeable but also capable of thriving in a collaborative and communicative environment. Such a comprehensive approach to recruitment will significantly enhance overall job performance and sustain long-term business success.",8.0
A lot of old people are suffering from lonliness these days. They also lack physical fitness. What do you think are the reasons for this problem. Can you think of some possible solutions.,"Nowadays a number of old people experience anxiety and prefer living in solitude rather than expressing their fears. As a result, they keep away from crowded areas, seldom stepping out for any physical activities thus spending a majority of their time indoors. Two of the majors reasons could be addiction to social media and age related problems. Two of the possible solutions are to disconnect from the virtual world and spend some time in the real world along with indulging in some light physical activities.

These days people spend most of their time surfing social media sites and crave validation along with trying to compare their lives with others. If they are lacking certain beauty standard or skills that are portrayed online many go into depression and isolate themselves from the world thus resulting in loneliness. Recently, the trend of body size zero is gaining popularity all over the internet and those aiming to achieve it resort to unhealthy methods such as harmful dieting or extreme exercise routine. People failing to keep up with these trends consider themselves to be failures and sometimes even contemplate suicide as they are unable to keep up with the pressure.


 
An important solution is to restrict the time spent online and meet and interact with more people around. Time limit should to be set for accessing social media and outdoors activities should be given paramount importance. According to a recent study many people felt less depressed and revitalized when they went for a jog or run as the fresh air and boost in blood flow increased their energy. Moreover, participating in outdoor activities helps you meet new people and enables you to share ideas and strategies for the well being of the team.

This issue is partly attributable to reduced mobility due to health and age-related complications, as well as a decreasing circle of social connections following retirement. In this essay, I will delve into these underlying causes and propose suitable solutions to ameliorate the situation.

First and foremost, one major contributor to this problem is the fading social network experienced by the elderly following retirement. As individuals leave the workforce, their daily interactions with colleagues lessen, and their circle of acquaintances shrinks. This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Moreover, age-related health issues, such as arthritis or cardiovascular diseases, contribute to reduced mobility, making it challenging for older people to maintain a physically active lifestyle. Without regular engagement in physical activities, their overall fitness starts to diminish, which can affect mental health.

In addressing these issues, a multifaceted approach involving community intervention and technological support would be beneficial. Community centres, for instance, can play a central role in combatting loneliness among seniors by organizing group activities—such as book clubs, exercise classes tailored for older adults, or gardening groups—that encourage social interaction and physical activity simultaneously. Similarly, local governments and organizations could promote age-friendly events, ensuring transportation and accessibility for individuals with limited mobility.

Furthermore, technology offers innovative solutions to connect the elderly with their peers and family members. While digital platforms sometimes seem daunting for older adults, offering technology classes specifically designed for seniors can bridge this gap, equipping them with the necessary skills to use smartphones, tablets, and social media in a safe and meaningful manner. This can foster a sense of community online and reduce feelings of isolation. Also, wearable technology for monitoring physical activity can serve as an encouraging tool, motivating older adults to remain active by tracking their daily steps or exercise routines.

In conclusion, the growing issues of loneliness and insufficient physical fitness among seniors necessitate targeted and thoughtful solutions. By expanding social programs and leveraging technology, the elderly can enjoy vibrant social lives and improved physical health. Collective efforts from society as a whole are imperative in ensuring that older generations lead fulfilling and contented lives.",8.0

I partially agree with the statement, arguing that while education is crucial, it alone is not sufficient to eradicate poverty. A more holistic approach involving education, employment opportunities, and international cooperation is necessary for meaningful progress.

Firstly, providing free education up to a certain level equips individuals with essential skills such as literacy and numeracy, which are foundational for personal advancement and societal development. As evidenced by countries like Singapore, a robust education system can significantly contribute to economic prosperity by nurturing a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. However, it's not merely about making education free, but ensuring its quality and relevance to the job market. Governments should invest in training programs that align with industry needs, promoting skill development that directly contributes to economic growth.

Additionally, education must be complemented with job creation and employment opportunities. Establishing programs that offer vocational training and apprenticeships can bridge the gap between education and employment. This ensures that individuals do not just possess academic qualifications but are also job-ready. Furthermore, governments should implement policies that attract foreign investment to stimulate business development, thereby increasing job opportunities and boosting local economies.

Moreover, building strong international relationships can aid in poverty alleviation. By forming partnerships with developed nations, developing countries can benefit from foreign aid, and trade agreements, and gain access to advanced technologies. For instance, countries that are part of international coalitions like ASEAN have experienced significant economic growth due to mutual cooperation and shared resources.

In conclusion, while providing six years of free education is a commendable initiative, it is not a panacea for poverty. A multifaceted strategy that includes educational reforms, job creation, and international collaboration is essential to effectively reduce poverty and foster sustainable development. By addressing these key areas, developing nations can create a more resilient economic infrastructure, paving the way for long-term prosperity.",8.0

Some people believe that it can be considered an effective  solution to poverty. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view and think that free schooling is the best way to fight poverty.

Firstly, the Government should make elementary studies free of charge because it can help students  not alabelon school and then become  positive and productive members of  society . There are plenty of families  in developing nations that cannot fully afford to send their children to school. Consequently, these students  will be forced to alabelon their studies and be exposed to be unemployed and in some cases criminals in order to earn money to afford their living . For example , research shows that nations in which the level of unemployment is higher suffer more from economic problems . That is why this method can be a useful solution to this issue .

Secondly, primary learning helps children to develop several skills and abilities. In other words, education will help individuals to grow because they will obtain a better understanding of life and get more knowledge and skills . therefore , pupils  will gain financial stability  in the future because they may have the possibility to land a good job and a high-paying salary.

The proposition that providing six years of free education can significantly alleviate poverty is a compelling one. I strongly agree with this notion, as it opens doors to countless opportunities for disadvantaged children, equipping them with essential skills for a better future. However, I acknowledge that free education alone may not be a panacea to poverty, and complementary measures should be taken into account.

To begin with, making primary education free and accessible ensures that children from impoverished families who cannot afford education can gain basic literacy and numeracy skills. These foundational skills are crucial for individuals to thrive in modern society. If primary education is free, children who would otherwise remain illiterate have the chance to become competent readers, writers, and problem solvers, which in turn promotes their integration into the workforce. For instance, studies have indicated that countries with higher literacy rates tend to have lower unemployment rates, demonstrating a direct correlation between education and employability.

Furthermore, education enhances critical thinking and intellectual development, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about various aspects of life, from health to finance. Such comprehensive educational exposure prepares students for further education or vocational training, leading to higher-paying jobs in the future. As a result, educated individuals can lift themselves and their families out of the poverty cycle, contributing positively to the economy. It is evident that enabling individuals to break this cycle contributes to community growth and prosperity.

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that free education alone might not suffice to eradicate poverty completely. Other contributing factors that hinder education, such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of qualified teachers, and social obstacles, should also be addressed. Additionally, initiatives such as job creation, stable governance, and access to healthcare are essential to create a holistic environment where education can effectively combat poverty. Thus, while I strongly advocate for free primary education as a foundational step, it should be supplemented with other strategic measures for a sustainable impact.

In conclusion, providing six years of free education in developing countries is an essential step towards reducing poverty. It equips individuals with basic skills required for personal growth and employment. However, it should be part of a broader package of reforms addressing other societal challenges to effectively lift communities out of poverty. By taking a multifaceted approach, developing countries can pave the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.",8.0
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements?
What measures can be taken to protect them?","It is hard to deny that advertising from competing companies can impair consumers' consumption concepts as advertisements always trying to persuade people to purchase expensive but maybe unsuitable products. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that advertising is harmful to consumers, and  should be censored or even controlled by the government. However, such a statement suffers from logical and factual fallacies and should be examined meticulously. As far as the economy, employment, and consumption concept are concerned, I firmly hold that advertisements can be beneficial to society and the community, and false or harmful information should be censored by the government.

First and foremost, the advertising industry provides employment, as it has become a creative industry that gives profitable jobs to many people. To be more specific, advertising has become a modern art and many universities or colleges have this subject, providing many graduates for companies or celebrities to advertise and increase their influence. In addition, there are many job vacancies as almost all companies need to advertise their products to consumers.

Furthermore, the fact that advertising can boost sales of one company or product, improving the  economy indicates that it can be beneficial. For example, take the case of YeShu, a well-known milk company famous for its quality and good taste: huge investment in advertising makes people associate its brand image with high quality, good taste, and even making people smart. As a result, more and more consumers know and buy its products. Had it not been for its impressive and attractive advertisement, YeShu would need have become one of the largest companies in the drinking industry.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that advertising is always trying to manipulate people to consume more and has influenced many people even children to develop a bad consumption concept. Ironically, though advertising is trying to persuade consumers to buy more, people can not be easily manipulated. For instance, consumers can see comments and reviews from other consumers, and advertisements that boost too much can easily find out.

In a nutshell, I maintain that foreign visitors should pay more as such a policy is feasible to implement, and benefits our national culture and economy. Admittedly, as my favourite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues to fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me. However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article",8,6.5,"To elevate your essay from a 6.5 to an 8.0, let's take a closer look at each component, starting with the task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy.

1. Task Response:
   - Your essay partially addresses the task by discussing both the influence of advertisements and measures to protect consumers. However, the essay lacks a balanced evaluation of the extent to which consumers are actually influenced by advertisements and an exploration of specific measures that could be implemented.

2. Coherence and Cohesion:
   - Your essay structure is generally logical, but some parts are inconsistent. The switch from discussing advertisements broadly to the conclusion about foreign visitors paying more appears out of context and indicates a lack of focus. Ensure every paragraph ties back to the main task questions. Use clearer transition words or phrases to enhance flow and connect ideas more coherently.

3. Lexical Resource:
   - While your vocabulary is generally good, there are some awkward phrase constructions and word choices, such as ""consumption concepts"" or ""boost too much."" Aim to enhance the precision of your language by using more subject-specific terms and varied vocabulary that more precisely conveys your ideas.

4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
   - You demonstrate a range of grammatical structures; however, there are issues with sentence fragments and awkward constructions, such as ""Had it not been for its impressive and attractive advertisement, YeShu would need have become one of the largest companies."" Review your sentences for clarity and correctness, particularly with verb forms and conditionals. Ensure subjects and verbs agree and consider simplifying complex sentences that may be convoluted.

Overall Suggestions and Improvements:
- Revisit the introduction to clearly state your thesis and the extent to which you believe consumers are influenced by advertisements.
- Dedicate one paragraph to thoroughly evaluate how advertisements affect different demographic groups, supporting your points with research or hypothetical scenarios.
- Clearly outline and discuss potential measures that can be implemented to protect consumers from deceptive advertising, potentially referencing existing policies in other countries for validation.
- Revise your conclusion to reflect the core discussion points, removing unrelated arguments like the one regarding foreign visitors, and instead summarizing the essay's main ideas while proposing solutions succinctly.

Overall Summary:
To achieve your desired band of 8.0, focus on deeply engaging with the task by offering balanced, well-supported arguments and ensuring your essay consistently addresses the topic. Improve coherence by structuring your essay logically and using clear transitions, while enhancing your lexical and grammatical precision. Addressing these areas should help you better meet the IELTS criteria and achieve a higher score.","In today's highly competitive market, consumers are constantly bombarded with advertisements from various companies aiming to capture their attention and influence their purchasing decisions. While advertising can significantly shape consumer behavior, its impact varies depending on multiple factors, including demographics and personal susceptibility. Therefore, it is essential to examine to what extent consumers are influenced by advertisements and to explore effective measures for safeguarding consumer interests.

Advertisements undeniably play a crucial role in shaping consumer preferences and consumption habits. They employ persuasive techniques and psychological triggers to influence individuals' perceptions and inspire them to purchase products even if they weren't initially interested. For example, aspirational advertising that associates products with higher social status or improved lifestyle can strongly sway consumers' choices, especially among impressionable groups such as teenagers or young adults. However, not all consumers are equally influenced by advertisements. Many buyers critically evaluate ads, relying on reviews, word of mouth, or personal experience before making a purchase.

To protect consumers from the adverse effects of aggressive advertising, certain measures can be implemented. Firstly, consumer education programs should be emphasized. By cultivating critical thinking skills, individuals can learn to interpret advertisements more discerningly and avoid being swayed by manipulative marketing tactics. Educational initiatives might include school curricula that focus on media literacy, helping young consumers develop a critical eye towards advertising content.

Secondly, stricter regulations on advertising practices need to be enforced to ensure honesty and transparency in marketing messages. Governments and regulatory bodies should work together to establish guidelines that prevent false claims, puffery, and misleading information. Tools like standardized consumer warnings for potentially harmful effects, particularly in sectors such as junk food or tobacco, could also be beneficial.

Finally, consumer advocacy groups play a significant role in safeguarding public interests. These organizations can pressure companies to adopt ethical advertising practices and provide platforms for consumers to voice their concerns regarding misleading marketing. Advocacy groups can also initiate public awareness campaigns about the risks of over-consumption fueled by aggressive advertising.

In conclusion, while consumers are undoubtedly influenced by advertisements, the extent of this influence is mediated by various factors. With the right protective measures, such as consumer education, regulatory enforcement, and active advocacy, the negative impacts of advertising can be minimized, allowing consumers to make informed and autonomous purchasing decisions. By striking a balance between corporate interests and consumer protection, society can ensure that advertising supports rather than undermines public welfare.",8.0

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it.

Good luck!","The perennial debate on whether embracing change or adhering to routine is more beneficial continues to evoke diverse opinions. On one hand, there are those who cherish the comfort of familiarity, preferring stability in their daily lives. On the other, some view change as an indispensable avenue for personal development and enriching experiences. Both perspectives carry compelling arguments, and in this essay, I will discuss each view before presenting my own stance.

Firstly, to understand why some individuals prioritize consistency over change, it is crucial to appreciate the psychological comfort that stability can offer. Many people find solace in familiar patterns and routines, as they provide a predictable and safe environment. For those who feel threatened or anxious by the unpredictability of change, maintaining the status quo offers a refuge from potential risks and failures. For instance, individuals stuck in jobs they dislike might still prefer staying put over confronting the uncertainties of job-hunting or adapting to new work cultures. The consistency of routine can be reassuring, allowing people to focus their energy on other aspects of life rather than adjusting to frequent changes.

Conversely, change advocates argue that stepping out of one's comfort zone is essential for personal growth and opportunities. Embracing change can lead to new experiences, skills, and perspectives that would otherwise remain unexplored. Such adaptability can significantly enhance one's quality of life and open doors to innovative paths and ideas. For instance, moving to a new country, though daunting, can enrich one's understanding of different cultures, enhance career prospects, and foster new relationships. Therefore, change becomes a vehicle for transformation that can offer both personal satisfaction and tangible rewards.

In weighing both sides, I align more with the view that change is a necessary element of life. While the comfort zone undoubtedly provides relief, it also risks stunting personal and professional growth. Change cultivates resilience and flexibility, attributes that are increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing world. Individuals who embrace change are often better equipped to seize opportunities, an essential skill in navigating the challenges of modern life.

In conclusion, while the inclination to resist change is understandable, embracing it typically yields greater benefits in terms of self-improvement and opportunities. Life inevitably presents us with changes, whether we seek them or not. It is better to embrace them proactively, learning and growing with each experience. Ultimately, change is not just a possibility but a certainty, and by adapting to it, we enrich our lives and expand our horizons.",8.0

    On the one hand, it can be said that with the modernization of the world, people become more dependent on each other, in the sense that today many people can easily communicate with each other, and as a result of that dependence is created. With the advancement of technology and the creation of more modern communication tools, as we can see, people can easily communicate with each other. Take today's mobile phones as an example. A person in a foreign country can easily communicate with someone in a fraction of a second; on the other side of the borders, it is easy to communicate with the Internet connection, and as a result, many long-distance relationships are created in which there is naturally dependence. Although I feel that this type of dependence is unrealistic and there is no correct definition of dependence in this concept.

    On the other hand, it can be said that people are more independent than before. Today, with life conditions becoming more complicated, many people spend many hours of their time working, studying, or studying, and as a result, they are less able to spend time with their friends or family. For example, consider a family where both huslabel and wife are forced to work due to high living expenses such as providing housing, food and clothing, and as a result, they can devote less time to being together, and as a result, they become less dependent on each other. In addition, nowadays the concept of independence is very important and many psychologists emphasize independence especially for women and people care more about this aspect of their personality than before. They become completely independent, they especially tend to be financially independent. In fact, in the past, we saw many people around 30 years old or older who still lived with their families and were financially dependent, but today many people in Younger ages are trying to be independent and I believe this trend will continue and we will see more independent people every day.

    In general, I believe that although modernization with the increase in the level of technology can in some ways make people more dependent than before, but due to reasons such as the complexity of life and the popularization of the concept of independence from a young age, today we see an increase in independent people.",5,6.5,"Certainly, here is a breakdown of feedback based on different scoring criteria and overall suggestions for improvement:

**Overall Summary:**
The essay effectively covers both perspectives on dependence versus independence in modern society, but lacks depth in supporting arguments. Greater detail, sophisticated language use, and polished grammar will significantly improve the essay's quality. Focus on expanding both analysis of each viewpoint and using diverse vocabulary to achieve a higher score.","In today's interconnected world, there is a debate about whether individuals have become more dependent on each other or more self-reliant due to modernization. While some argue that modern advancements lead to increased interdependence, others maintain that they foster greater independence. In my opinion, contemporary developments tend to enhance self-reliance, despite the inherent interconnectedness they bring.

Supporters of the view that we are more dependent argue that the proliferation of communication technologies has facilitated unprecedented levels of human connection, leading to an increase in mutual reliance. Technologies such as instant messaging, video conferencing, and social networking platforms allow us to maintain relationships across great distances, thus fostering a level of emotional and social dependence. For instance, businesses now rely on global teams coordinated via digital means to operate efficiently. However, while this type of technological interdependence exists, it primarily supports cooperation rather than suggesting a lack of individual independence.

Conversely, the notion of increased independence is supported by the way technology empowers individuals to perform tasks once dependent on others. For example, with online education platforms, people no longer need to rely on geographical proximity to attend classes or acquire new skills. Young professionals leverage these resources to advance their careers without traditional constraints. Additionally, the gig economy has flourished, with freelancers gaining financial independence, enabled by digital platforms that allow them to reach global clients independently. These examples illustrate how modern tools equip individuals to operate autonomously.

Moreover, the societal shift towards valuing individualism has played a crucial role in fostering independence. The complexity of modern life, accompanied by the high cost of living, necessitates self-reliance. Many young adults today prioritize financial independence, moving out of their family homes earlier and balancing multiple careers. This trend is further bolstered by cultural influences emphasizing personal empowerment.

In conclusion, while connectivity technologies ostensibly create dependencies, they actually augment the ability of individuals to operate independently by providing new tools for personal and professional growth. The modern drive towards individual achievement and self-sufficiency has been significantly amplified by these advancements, leading to a greater level of independence in contemporary society. Therefore, it is evident that modernization is driving us towards a future of increased self-reliance, despite the technological threads that weave us together.",8.0
Some people think that the teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. they believe this would benefit both the teenagers and society as a whole.,"Youngsters are the building blocks of the nation and they play an important role in serving the society because at this age they are full of energy not only mentally but physically also. some people think that youth should do some voluntary work for the society in their free time and it would be beneficial for both of them. I agree with the statement. it has numerous benefits which will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, they could do a lot of activities and make their spare time fruitful. first of all, they can teach children living in slum areas because they are unable to afford education in schools or colleges. as a result, they will become civilized individuals and do not indulge in antisocial activities. by doing this they could gain a lot of experience and becomes responsible towards the society. it would be beneficial in their future perspective.

In addition to this, they learn a sense of cooperation and sharing with other persons of the society. for instance, they could grow plants and trees at public places and this would be helpful not only to make the surrounding clean and green but reduce the pollution also to great extent. moreover, they could arrange awareness programmes in society and set an example among the natives of the state. this will make the social bonding strong between the individuals and this will also enhance their social skills.

Proponents of this idea argue that such initiatives bring significant benefits not only to the young individuals but also to society as a whole. I thoroughly concur with this viewpoint and believe that mandatory volunteering can foster a symbiotic relationship between the youth and their communities. This essay will explore both the personal advantages for teenagers and the broader societal gains, while addressing potential counterarguments.

Firstly, encouraging teenagers to participate in community service can lead to numerous personal growth opportunities. One key benefit is that it fosters a sense of responsibility and real-world understanding among youngsters. When adolescents engage in activities such as teaching underprivileged children or assisting at local shelters, they develop empathy and an appreciation for diverse backgrounds. These experiences not only bolster their social skills but also prepare them for adulthood. Furthermore, such involvement can enhance their resume and increase their chances of securing better educational and employment opportunities.

On the societal front, teenage volunteering contributes significantly to community well-being. One impactful way is through environmental projects, like initiating tree-planting campaigns or organizing clean-up drives. Such endeavors not only beautify public spaces but also raise awareness about ecological conservation among community members. Additionally, young volunteers can play a pivotal role in organizing awareness programs on public health issues or digital literacy workshops, thereby promoting informed citizenry.

However, some critics argue that requiring unpaid work may exploit teenagers’ free time or distract from academic commitments. While this concern holds some merit, it is essential to consider the underlying intention of cultivating a sense of civic duty. Balancing volunteer work with academic pursuits can be achieved through effective time management and selecting projects that align with their interests or career aspirations.

In conclusion, involving teenagers in unpaid community service is a commendable approach that offers substantial benefits to both individuals and society. It instills a sense of responsibility and equips young people with valuable life skills while simultaneously fostering stronger, more cohesive communities. By acknowledging and addressing potential drawbacks, we can ensure that this initiative enhances personal development and social progress, ultimately enabling the youth to “give back” constructively to the society they are destined to lead. Thus, both parents and educators should actively promote the participation of teenagers in community service initiatives.",8.0
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger. What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?,"Growing population has become one of the significant issues globally as it can have both positive and negative consequences. In the recent trends, it is observed that in certain countries there is a hike in the count of children who are less than 16 year old. In this essay, I will analyze the feasible effects this growth can bring to the nation at present and future in terms of merits as well as demerits.

To begin with, the pattern observed has its own results in the present. On the positive side, as the number progresses to be high the government is enforced to provide better sanitation facilities for the kids, since the kids are more vulnerable to diseases. This will not only benefit the younger ones but also the adults by providing them with good medical facilities. However, looking at the other side, the public bodies will have to spend more on the resources such as food and education. This can cause a considerable amount of stress for them in terms of financial aspect, which can eventually lead to an increase in the tax collection that affects the public.

Moving further ahead and thinking about the consequences of the future, there will be a good revampment in terms of the nation's infrastructure development in numerous fields including internet, business and health. This is due to the fact that there will be a plethora of educated people with a specialization in a variety of fields. Contradictorily, the more number of educated youths can lead to an adverse situation namely unemployment. As the count of the competent persons in a domain is more, the most skillful ones will end up with a job. So the government needs to plan accordingly to provide employment to all the citizens.

To recapitulate, this essay deals with the various factors that can impact the nations where there is a constant improvement in the population.",3,6.5,"Thank you for sharing your essay. Let's go through some feedback and suggestions to help you elevate your work to the desired score of 8.0.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

**Overall Summary:**
Your essay demonstrates a well-rounded approach to discussing the impacts of a youthful demographic but requires more depth, a broader vocabulary, and enhanced grammatical precision for a higher score. Apply these suggestions consistently, and you'll be better equipped to reach your desired score of 8.0. Keep practicing, and great improvements are sure to follow.","In recent years, several nations have witnessed a significant rise in the population of individuals aged 15 or younger. This demographic trend presents both current and potential future challenges and opportunities. In this essay, I will explore the effects of such an increase in the youth population, substantiating my points with specific examples and plausible scenarios.

Presently, a burgeoning young population exerts considerable pressure on governmental resources. On the one hand, this growth spurs demands for enhanced public health and education services. For instance, governments are compelled to upgrade sanitation facilities to prevent outbreaks of diseases among children who are particularly vulnerable. This not only improves the overall health outcome of young people but also enhances public health for the entire community, exemplifying a positive outcome of this demographic trend.

Conversely, providing sufficient educational resources and infrastructure places a substantial financial burden on state budgets. Given that each government must allocate significant funds to ensure schools are adequately staffed and equipped, some countries may face financial strain, potentially leading to increased taxation. This could result in a public backlash, especially if citizens feel overburdened by rising costs.

Looking ahead, a growing youthful demographic can drive future economic development. A larger number of educated, technologically-savvy young individuals could transform industries, advance innovation, and contribute to a vibrant economy. Japan serves as a testament to this, where a highly educated youth skilled in technology has spurred significant advancements in multiple sectors, fostering economic growth.

However, this future outlook is not without concerns. A potential oversupply of educated youths in the job market could result in heightened unemployment. For instance, if job creation does not keep pace with the number of graduates, many young professionals might find it challenging to secure suitable employment, engendering frustration and economic stagnation. Governments must therefore develop comprehensive strategies to create jobs and provide avenues for skill development to harness the full potential of their youth.

In conclusion, while the increasing youth population poses certain challenges, it also presents remarkable opportunities for national growth and development. By strategically anticipating these shifts and implementing policies that foster education and employment, countries can optimistically look forward to developing a robust and sustainable future. Overall, recognizing and addressing both the current and future implications of this demographic trend is crucial for achieving long-term societal prosperity.",8.0

Traditionally, knowledge was preserved primarily in books. Nowadays, it is extensively stored and accessed online. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this shift, arguing that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

One major advantage of storing knowledge online is the ease and convenience of access. The internet offers instantaneous solutions to a myriad of queries, permeating everyday life with the sentiment of ""just Google it."" At any given moment, individuals can find detailed information on a vast array of topics using their smartphones or computers, making learning and problem-solving faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, the internet has played a pivotal role in democratizing education. Students in remote and underserved areas, who previously faced barriers to accessing educational resources, can now benefit from a wealth of freely available digital materials. For instance, open-source educational platforms and digital libraries provide thousands of youths with access to vital educational content that traditional, expensive textbooks may have restricted.

Despite these advantages, there are certain drawbacks to consider. A significant concern is the prevalence of inaccurate or misleading information online. The sheer volume of content available, some lacking credibility or factual accuracy, can lead individuals, especially those without critical evaluation skills, to accept falsehoods as fact. This underlines the need for better information literacy education and possibly stricter regulations to ensure the reliability of online content.

In conclusion, the transition from storing knowledge in books to the internet has provided extraordinary benefits, such as greater accessibility and educational opportunities for people worldwide. While the presence of unreliable information online poses challenges, these can be managed with appropriate measures and education. Therefore, on balance, the shift towards digital knowledge storage is a positive development with its advantages prominently outweighing the disadvantages.",8.0
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time . This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well . To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is highly debatable that adolescents should participate in unpaid community service during their leisure time. Many people believe this will have a positive impact on these youngsters and the public at large. I completely agree with the statement above and this essay will highlight some of the important merits of this service.

By participating in free work for the community, there are various pros to what these teens can achieve from the exercise. For example, their involvement in the neighbourhood clinic can help build their future ambition in this field of work. Consequently, these lads might eventually want to become a surgeon or nurses as they might get exposed to certain health problems that will encourage them to be better at life. As a result, they find a way of giving back what they learnt to 

the society by becoming a productive citizen.

Furthermore, having Young lads engage in volunteer services will help keep them away from a life of crime as they have less time to engage in it. For instance, peer pressure has a significant role to play in a young child’s life. In fact, having friends who participate in these activities will in turn help burst their willingness to participate and as such, their orientation will improve as they eventually become responsible and disciplined adults in the nearest future.

Your essay clearly responds to the prompt by stating that you agree with the idea of teenagers participating in unpaid community service. However, to improve your score, consider providing a more nuanced discussion by acknowledging potential drawbacks or counterarguments to the requirement. This will demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Additionally, make sure to connect your examples back explicitly to how they benefit teenagers or the community.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay presents ideas in a logical order, but transitions between some ideas could be smoother. For instance, instead of jumping directly from one point to another, use linking words or phrases to show the connection. For example, ""Moreover,"" or ""Additionally,"" can show that you are expanding on the same idea. Sometimes, your paragraphs seem slightly disconnected; consider adding concluding sentences that tie back to the main argument and demonstrate a unified piece.

**Lexical Resource:**

You've used a variety of vocabulary, which is good. However, some terms like ""lads"" might not be the most formal choice for an academic essay. Instead, consider terms like ""young individuals"" or ""adolescents"". Additionally, be cautious of using phrases that could have gender implications like ""surgeon or nurses”. Use ""surgeons or nurses"" or ""health professionals"" in a balanced manner. Try to introduce more advanced vocabulary related to the topic to better convey precision and sophistication.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

While your grammatical structure is largely accurate, there are instances of errors such as “a surgeon or nurses” which should be “surgeons or nurses”. In some sentences, there are awkward phrasings, like ""help burst their willingness"" should be ""boost their willingness."" Aim for a wider variety of sentence structures to show range – mix complex and simple sentences to improve the flow and engage the reader.

While some argue that such activities can significantly benefit the young individuals and society, others raise concerns about mandating these volunteer efforts. Personally, I believe that the advantages, which encompass personal development and communal enhancement, far outweigh any potential disadvantages.

To begin with, engaging in volunteer work allows teenagers to acquire invaluable skills and experience that are not readily obtained in a traditional educational environment. For instance, working in a local healthcare facility can provide adolescents with firsthand exposure to the medical field, potentially inspiring them to pursue careers as health professionals. Such exposure not only broadens their understanding but also instills a sense of responsibility and empathy by interacting with people facing diverse health issues. Hence, these formative experiences can shape their future career paths, driving them to contribute to society as motivated and informed professionals.

Additionally, community service serves as a constructive outlet for teenagers, effectively reducing the likelihood of their involvement in delinquent activities. Adolescence is a crucial developmental stage, where peer influence can substantially sway a teenager’s decision-making. By spending their leisure time contributing to meaningful causes, adolescents are less likely to engage in negative behaviors. For example, a community cleanup project can foster a sense of accomplishment and teamwork, steering young individuals away from detrimental influences and instead cultivating qualities of cooperation and social responsibility.

Admittedly, one might argue that mandating community service encroaches on teenagers' freedom to choose how to spend their free time, potentially leading to resentment. Nevertheless, if schools and communities offer a diverse range of volunteer options tailored to varied interests, this concern can be alleviated. Providing flexibility allows teenagers to pursue activities they are passionate about, ensuring that the work remains intrinsically rewarding.

In conclusion, while compulsory community service for teenagers raises questions around autonomy, the benefits in terms of skill development and social engagement are profound. By participating in volunteer activities, adolescents stand to gain a broader perspective on life and a toolkit of skills beneficial for their personal growth and for the enrichment of the community. With the right implementation and a focus on student interests, these volunteer programs can nurture more conscientious and empathetic future citizens.",8.0

In today's rapidly evolving world, modern communication technology plays a pivotal role in shaping the way we interact with one another. While some critics argue that these advancements have adversely affected social relationships, others believe they have brought people closer together. In my opinion, modern communication technologies offer far more benefits than drawbacks when it comes to fostering social connections.

To begin with, technology has significantly reduced the barriers of time and space, allowing individuals to maintain close ties with family and friends across the globe. Platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram enable users to exchange messages, pictures, and videos instantly, making geographical distances virtually irrelevant. For instance, when I moved abroad for work, these communication tools allowed me to remain in constant touch with my loved ones back home. This ease of connectivity strengthens the bonds between individuals by enabling them to share experiences and offer support regardless of where they are located.

Moreover, during challenging times, such as the recent global lockdowns, technology has proven invaluable in keeping educational and social interactions alive. Online platforms have facilitated virtual classes, work meetings, and social events, preventing social disconnect despite the physical restrictions. This demonstrates how communication technology can foster a sense of community and collaboration, even in the most isolating circumstances.

While it is important to acknowledge that communication technology presents certain risks, such as the potential for superficial relationships and cyber infidelity, these issues largely depend on individual choices rather than the technology itself. Dating sites and platforms that encourage negative behavior do exist, but they do not overshadow the positive impact technology has on strengthening authentic relationships. It is essential for users to exercise discernment and responsibility in their online interactions to avoid these pitfalls.

In conclusion, modern communication technology has undoubtedly transformed the way we create and maintain social relationships. By bridging distances and facilitating communication, these tools have made it easier than ever to stay connected with loved ones. As with any tool, the responsibility lies with us to use technology wisely and to enhance rather than hinder our social interactions. With careful consideration and appropriate usage, the advantages of modern communication technology far outweigh its potential downsides, ultimately contributing positively to our social lives.",8.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Some countries prefer to single gender school for the education of their pupils. A native of some countries, prefer to send their children to the integrated institutions for their elementary education, because they believe it can affect drastically to their life in the upcoming period. I firmly believe that co-educational institutions are a boon, not only for the healthy future of children, but also for the nation as well.
Firstly, pupils who studied in single sex schools, take huge time to get involved in conversation with the opposite gender, the reason behind is, they never experienced public conversation earlier, therefore, pupils do not feel comfortable to speak publicly and get nervous when they have to ask any question or any favor. Moreover, children who get more comfortable in their own group, sometimes behave in improper way with others as few conversations should remain with close people. Most importantly the context of delivery of words should be accurate and proper; otherwise it could hurt the emotions of others or could leave the person embarrassed. The way of using proper words and gesture could develop by studding together.
Furthermore, students can learn and observe various things from their peer which are having opposite gender by doing healthy competition. This would lead to developing many traits which will enhance their knowledge and experience in a positive way. They will learn the sensitivity of words and acts that is lucrative for their own healthy future. In short, students who studied in co-educational schools are more disciplined and punctual.
In conclusion, students can have many skilled traits by studding together along with students of different age, religion and gender, which is possible by getting enrolled in integrated schools. That will develop the whole nation with the same environment, otherwise single sex school give a different atmosphere to students on the basis of their gender or sex.",6,6.5,"### Feedback for Improvement

This decision raises an important question: do students who attend single-sex schools experience disadvantages later in life? While there are certainly contexts where single-sex education may be beneficial, I believe that the holistic experience provided by co-educational schools significantly outweighs these advantages, primarily in terms of social and emotional development.

To begin with, it is crucial to acknowledge that single-sex schools can offer certain academic advantages. These institutions often tailor their teaching methods to suit gender-specific learning styles, potentially resulting in higher academic performance. Furthermore, without the presence of the opposite gender, students might feel less pressure to conform to social stereotypes, which can foster focus and academic dedication. However, it is essential to consider whether these benefits can actually translate effectively into real-world contexts, where interaction with all genders is inevitable.

The primary disadvantage of single-sex schooling lies in the social development of students. A co-educational environment naturally provides diverse interactions that are indispensable in cultivating social skills. Students learn to communicate and collaborate with peers of both genders, skills that are crucial in personal and professional spheres. For instance, students in mixed-gender settings gain insights into diverse perspectives and are more adept at handling interpersonal conflicts. This nurtures emotional intelligence and prepares them for careers where teamwork and understanding play pivotal roles.

Moreover, co-educational schools reflect the real social structure more accurately, offering students early exposure to a microcosm of society. This experience equips them with the ability to adapt to various social settings with ease. Children who are educated in such environments display higher levels of confidence and are more prepared to engage in meaningful dialogues with a diverse range of people.

In conclusion, while single-sex schools may afford certain academic advantages, the comprehensive benefits of co-educational schools, particularly regarding social and emotional development, stand out as more significant. In preparing students for adult life, where gender interactions are an everyday occurrence, co-educational institutions instil essential communication and cooperation skills, making them a more advantageous option. Thus, the notion that single-sex schooling leads to disadvantages later in life holds considerable weight.",8.0
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Arguably, it is commented that entities  trading in a specific region should not only be focused on profiting. However,  they should  care for the local communities. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since  enterprises  have responsibilities to  develop neighbourhoods. Although this development is highly criticised by  managers. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. 

On the one hand,  businesses are accountable for  the local  district  advancement. In other words,  once they  are exploring  raw materials, lands or other sorts of goods or services inward  communities they should  bear  their expenses. For instance, a Mozambique's company, Mozal is  devoted to aluminium exploitation in the Beluluane area, once it is  making money through the raw material of this  small area, the enterprise builds schools, roadways, and  employs the local  youth. As a result,  both  are the  greater winners, the local folk and  the company. It is the overriding reason for high develop small  lands  in Spain. 

On the other hand,  shareholders regard  social responsibility  as  financial resources consuming.  Because of the escalated  quantity of resources  utilized in  social activities,  the owners of these  institutions  criticise the development.  60% of   business institutions  are found it a hardship  to help  societies where they operate to exemplify. It is pointed out by the new research carried out by the University  of Southampton.  Hence,  there are  soared conflicts between  the  businesses owners and communities.  Moreover, It is the  prime  purpose for the shortfall in an agreement between woodcutters and the African crowd.

To sum up, notwithstanding the lack of support from the shareholders of businesses,  these explorers  should  collaborate  and help  the local livings owing to the fact that they  lately  depend on the local resources.  Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. I would go as far as to say, the local regime instils stricter measures to protect throng interests.",11,6.5,"**Feedback and Suggestions:**

I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective, as enterprises have an integral part to play in fostering the development of local communities. In pursuing this argument, I will explore the benefits and challenges of corporate social responsibility, and assess how businesses can effectively balance profit-making with social obligations.

To begin with, companies have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate, and it is only fair that they contribute positively to the local environment. For instance, businesses that exploit local resources and services do not operate in isolation; their activities affect the social and economic fabric of these communities. The example of Mozal, an aluminum company in Mozambique, illustrates this point. By investing in local infrastructure such as schools and roads, and by providing employment opportunities for the youth, Mozal has facilitated tangible improvements in the socio-economic conditions of the Beluluane area. Such actions not only enhance community well-being but also create a mutually beneficial relationship between the company and the community.

On the other hand, the notion of social responsibility is viewed by some as a potential drain on corporate resources. Shareholders often raise concerns regarding the financial impact of investing in socially responsible initiatives, fearing that they might compromise the core profit-generating activities of the business. A recent study conducted by the University of Southampton revealed that a significant number of businesses struggle to balance these costs with their social commitments. Additionally, conflicts between business interests and community expectations, such as those observed between logging companies and African communities, highlight the complexities of implementing social responsibility in practice.

Despite these challenges, it is incumbent upon businesses to find a sustainable balance between profitability and social commitments. By doing so, not only do they benefit the wider society, but they also enhance their brand image, customer loyalty, and long-term profitability. Moreover, government regulations can provide a supportive framework for businesses by enforcing policies that protect public interests and encourage sustainable practices.

In conclusion, while the financial burden of social responsibility cannot be ignored, the potential benefits of businesses engaging positively with their communities far outweigh the costs. Enterprises must embrace their social responsibilities as they rely on local resources and have the capacity to drive local development. Thus, I strongly endorse the idea that businesses, while making money, should indeed fulfill their social responsibilities to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future.",8.0

While some argue that its primary function is to drive economic growth, others believe it has detrimental effects on societal values by fostering dissatisfaction among individuals. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explore why, in my opinion, the economic benefits of advertising slightly outweigh its social drawbacks. 

To begin with, advertising serves as a crucial driver of economic activity. It acts as a conduit between producers and consumers by informing the latter about available products and services. For instance, research suggests that consumers are more likely to purchase products they have previously encountered through advertisements than those they have not. This consumer behavior stimulates sales, thereby boosting business revenues and, in turn, economic growth. Furthermore, the advertising industry itself creates substantial employment opportunities. It demands a diversity of skills, from creative design to strategic planning, thus providing jobs for millions of people across the globe. Additionally, the revenue generated from such economic growth can be reinvested into other areas of society, potentially contributing to overall national prosperity.

On the contrary, the social implications of advertising cannot be overlooked. One of the principal criticisms is that it propagates a culture of materialism and consumerism. Advertisements often portray idealized lifestyles and promote high-status products, which can lead individuals to feel inadequate if they are unable to afford such items. This phenomenon of induced dissatisfaction can result in unhealthy societal behavior, where self-worth is measured against material possessions. For instance, within educational environments, the enforcement of school uniforms is designed to eradicate socioeconomic discrepancies among students, preventing bullying and fostering equality. Yet, the glamorization of consumer goods in advertisements can undermine these efforts, as students may find other ways to distinguish status, which in extreme cases may drive some towards illegal activities in a bid to maintain parity.

In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly spurs economic growth by increasing consumer spending and offering job opportunities, it also presents significant social challenges by influencing individuals' perceptions of self-worth. To strike a balance, I believe that regulatory frameworks should be strengthened to mitigate the adverse social impacts of advertising, such as ensuring truthfulness in ads and promoting ethical standards that do not exploit consumers' insecurities. If managed well, the benefits of advertising can be optimized in a way that upholds societal values while still driving economic progress.",8.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done solve this problem?,"Nowadays, more products which are consumed rapidly are manufactured, and as a result, the ecosystem is facing a severe problem. At the same time, however, there is some uncertainty as to the causes of this trend and its measures. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the debate to seek a conclusion.

To begin with, consumers tend to buy an excess quantity of items even when they already have enough to use and throw them away after years of hoarding. For instance, some young girls hoard facial masks and lipsticks, but never use them before treating them as rubbish. Moreover, by producing various goods that can be consumed the manufacturers can profit significantly. However, in the process of making the products there are chemicals emitting into the air and rivers which will pollute the atmosphere and water. In addition, as the technology of inventing and updating electronic devices is improving, digital items are updated more and more quickly which cost numerous natural resources.

On the other hand, there are some steps that can be taken to resolve these problems. Advertisings which persuade customers to buy things should be under supervision. Also, governments can broadcast some videos against consumerism, raising the awareness of the public. Furthermore, laws and regulations on the manufacturing industry should be created to protect the environment.

To summarize, there is no doubt that producing consumer items can bring serious ecological damages. At the same time, however, governments, manufacturers and advertising enterprises can take measures to reduce the influences. In the final analysis, one can conclude that governments bear the main responsibility to protect the environment in this kind of production.",4,6.5,"Feedback on the Essay:

Increased consumer demand, driven by modern consumer culture and the relentless quest for economic growth, significantly contributes to this trend. Moreover, manufacturers' negligence towards environmental responsibility further exacerbates this issue. However, strategic and multifaceted approaches can mitigate these detrimental effects and preserve our planet's integrity.

One of the primary causes of environmental damage from consumer goods production is the prevalent consumer culture that equates happiness with material possession. Contemporary advertisements promote a lifestyle centered around fast-moving consumer goods, such as electronics and fashion items, leading to excessive consumption and waste generation. This culture fosters an insatiable demand for the latest products, prompting manufacturers to produce more goods, often ignoring sustainable practices to minimize cost and maximize profit.

Economic factors also play a crucial role in driving excessive production. In pursuit of economic growth, nations encourage industrial expansion and consumerism, inadvertently contributing to environmental degradation. Additionally, the lack of stringent regulations protecting natural resources allows manufacturers to shirk environmental accountability, resulting in pollution from chemical emissions and the depletion of raw materials.

Addressing these issues requires concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders. First and foremost, governments should implement stringent environmental regulations that mandate sustainable manufacturing practices. International agreements should be endorsed to ensure that manufacturing processes worldwide align with ecological conservation goals. Moreover, incentivizing industries to adopt eco-friendly technologies can aid in reducing the carbon footprint and promoting the use of biodegradable and recyclable materials.

Public education is equally important. Consumers should be made aware of the environmental impacts of their purchasing habits. Comprehensive programs focusing on eco-friendly consumer behavior can foster a more sustainable culture over time. By promoting initiatives such as reusable products and reducing single-use items, the demand for constantly updated goods can be curtailed, lessening the strain on natural resources.

Finally, advertising strategies should highlight sustainable practices and ethical consumerism. Enterprises must be encouraged to showcase their commitment to the environment, thereby creating a market preference for sustainably produced goods.

In conclusion, the environmental challenges posed by the production of consumer goods are significant but not insurmountable. By addressing the root causes such as consumer culture and lax regulations and implementing robust solutions like governmental policies, technological innovations, and comprehensive education, a balanced approach can be achieved—fostering economic development while conserving our natural environment.

"Many university students cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","It is widely known that there are many university graduates who are unable to work in their desired fields after they finish their studies. This essay will elucidate the causes behind this phenomenon and offer solutions to tackle the problems.

To begin with, the most common reason is the fact that fresh graduates usually do not have the technical skills that their chosen profession requires. Possessing technical knowledge is an essential factor that employers consider when assessing job applicants. Meanwhile, university students tend to focus more on theoretical aspects rather than practical sides. Furthermore, this circumstance is exacerbated by limited job availability due to  increasing competition in job markets. To cite an example, there are fewer jobs in government institutions than the number of students holding a degree in political science. 

Nonetheless, there are certainly some steps that can be taken to face those challenges. Firstly, university students should take internship jobs prior to applying to full-time jobs. Having more exposure to the professional world, students can identify the practical skills they need in order to excel in those jobs. After completing internships, they can also consider finding jobs in different cities to increase the probability of finding their dream occupations. For instance, they can try to browse jobs in the top five largest cities in their country. 

In conclusion, the main rationales that hinder university graduates from getting their desired profession are twofold, they are the lack of technical abilities and the low number of job postings. University students can mitigate these by joining internship programs and expanding their job-searching efforts",7,7.5,"**Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement:**

This issue is influenced by a range of factors, which include both individual and systemic concerns. In this essay, I will explore these factors and suggest potential solutions that could help address this persistent problem.

One significant factor contributing to this issue is the misalignment between university curricula and the current job market demands. Many universities emphasize theoretical knowledge without equipping students with the industry-specific competencies and practical expertise required by employers. As a result, graduates may lack the hands-on experience that is often a prerequisite for entry-level positions. Furthermore, economic factors play a crucial role; economic downturns or industry-specific challenges can lead to fewer job openings in certain professions, making it harder for graduates to find suitable positions. For instance, the recent global pandemic has led to a decline in job opportunities in various sectors, including tourism and hospitality.

Moreover, rapid technological advancements and shifts in industry standards also contribute to this challenge. Some traditional professions are being redefined due to automation and digitalization, requiring new skill sets that graduates may not possess. Consequently, there is a growing mismatch between the skills students acquire and those demanded by evolving job markets.

To combat these issues, several measures can be implemented. Firstly, universities should foster stronger partnerships with industries to create curricula that reflect current market trends and requirements. Incorporating more internship and cooperative education opportunities within academic programs can bridge the gap between theory and practice, allowing students to gain valuable insights and experience. For instance, engineering programs that integrate work placements have seen higher employment rates for their graduates.

Additionally, governments and educational institutions should invest in continuous career counseling and skills development programs. Encouraging students to engage in lifelong learning will not only prepare them for immediate employment but also equip them with the adaptability required in a constantly changing job landscape. Graduates could benefit from attending workshops or online courses focused on emerging technologies, enhancing their employability in diverse fields.

In conclusion, the challenges faced by university graduates in securing jobs in their desired professions are multifaceted, involving academic, economic, and technological dimensions. To effectively address these issues, a collaborative approach that includes curriculum reform, increased practical training, and continuous skills development is essential. By implementing these strategies, we can better prepare graduates to meet the demands of the modern workforce and improve their employment prospects.",8.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this?

Therefore, this essay will explicate some key reasons why environment is polluted and will suggest a range of possible measures that can be taken to improve/change the situation and highlight probable knock-on effects of polluted environment. 

A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that lot of companies did not treat the drainage properly. The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because the modern drainage was not installed by this company, and they threw all the industrial waste into the water causing water pollution in this area. Thus, it is no surprise to see that there is rise in producing consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

Improvements to polluted environment can be achieved in a variety of ways, strict management of dischargement is one of the most favourable and note-worthy choice. To elaborate, government should be controlled strictly and only allow which company to have environmental protection standards so they never can throw their trash which are harmful to the environment into the atmosphere. This can improve the situation by controlling the amount of industrial waste to environment and encouraging recycle waste. Thus, while there can be other steps to be taken, this can be considered to be a good start towards declining the damage to the natural environment caused by manufacturing consumer goods.",1,6.5,"**Feedback:**

This essay will explore the primary causes of this phenomenon and propose viable solutions to mitigate its impact, in the hope of constructing a more sustainable future.

One of the foremost causes of environmental damage is the excessive extraction of natural resources. As consumer demand grows, industries extract materials such as minerals, timber, and fossil fuels at an unsustainable rate. For example, the over-logging of forests not only leads to habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity but also contributes to soil erosion and climate change. Moreover, the immense energy required for manufacturing processes often relies on burning fossil fuels, thus releasing vast amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. 

Another significant factor is the improper management of industrial waste. Factories frequently dispose of toxic waste without adequate treatment, leading to water and soil contamination. An illustrative case is that of the aforementioned Ajinomoto company, where untreated waste was discharged into local water bodies, polluting ecosystems and threatening public health. Furthermore, the rapid generation of non-biodegradable waste, such as plastics, accumulates in landfills and oceans, disrupting marine life and entering the food chain.

To address these pressing issues, a multifaceted approach is imperative. Firstly, governments and industries should collaborate to enforce stricter environmental regulations that mandate sustainable resource management and energy efficiency. Incentivizing the use of renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, could significantly reduce carbon footprints and promote green technology innovation.

Additionally, adopting a circular economy model whereby materials are continually reused and recycled can minimize waste and reduce reliance on raw materials. For instance, companies could implement take-back schemes where consumers return products for recycling or refurbishing. Public awareness campaigns are also essential to educate consumers about the environmental impact of their purchasing choices and promote more sustainable behaviors.

In conclusion, the burgeoning production of consumer goods undeniably harms the environment through resource depletion, pollution, and waste. However, by implementing stringent regulations, promoting technological advancements, and encouraging public participation, it is possible to alleviate these adverse effects and pave the way towards a healthier planet. Through collective action, both industries and individuals can contribute to this critical effort to conserve the environment for future generations.",8.0

Not everyone believes that news influences our everyday lives, leading some to consider it a time-waster. However, I strongly disagree with this view, as news plays a crucial role in shaping our awareness and understanding of the world. It serves as a bridge that connects us to global happenings and informs our decisions.

Firstly, news keeps us informed about current events, which directly or indirectly impact our lives. Be it economic, social, political, or environmental issues, news educates us about the ongoing scenarios that shape the framework of our society. For instance, staying updated with the latest economic developments allows individuals to make informed decisions regarding investments or savings, ultimately affecting their financial livelihood. Similarly, awareness of health advisories, such as those issued during a pandemic, ensures people take necessary precautions to safeguard themselves and their communities.

Moreover, news enhances our knowledge base and broadens our perspectives. It presents diverse viewpoints and fosters critical thinking. Exposure to a variety of issues ranging from scientific advances to cultural insights enables individuals to develop informed opinions. This enrichment of knowledge contributes to personal growth and the ability to engage in meaningful discussions. For example, students who follow scientific news are better equipped to participate in class discussions, supporting their academic journeys with a deeper understanding of their subjects.

However, some argue that news can be biased or sensationalized, thus questioning its reliability and relevance. While this critique holds merit, individuals can overcome this by consuming news from multiple reputable sources and employing their analytical skills. A discerning approach ensures that one effectively distinguishes between fact and opinion, thus maintaining access to well-rounded information.

In conclusion, the assertion that news has no bearing on our lives is unfounded. Keeping up with the news empowers individuals by informing their decisions, enhancing knowledge, and encouraging active participation in societal matters. By critically engaging with news media, individuals can significantly benefit from its insights and remain connected to the world around them.",8.0
"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works.

Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.
There are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.
Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their huslabels. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.

Keep practicing these aspects to better communicate your ideas effectively.","In contemporary society, where both men and women often partake in full-time employment, it is rational to propose that household responsibilities should be shared equally. I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint as equitable division of domestic chores not only upholds gender equality but also enhances the overall dynamics within a household.

One compelling reason to support the sharing of household duties is the essential principle of gender equality. In modern times, neither gender is innately superior to the other. Both men and women have the right to pursue their careers and ambitions. As such, when both partners are equally contributing to the family's earnings, it is only fair that domestic tasks are equally divided. This practice fosters a sense of partnership and mutual respect, which are crucial for a harmonious home environment. For instance, in households where responsibilities are shared, partners may enjoy a better work-life balance, allowing them more quality time together, thus strengthening their relationship.

Moreover, sharing household chores transcends beyond equality—it empowers women, and encourages societal progress. By normalizing men participating in domestic tasks, we challenge societal norms that have traditionally positioned women as the primary homemakers. This cultural shift can have a profound impact, particularly in regions where women are still seen as subservient to men. When men are seen taking an active role in household management, it sets a precedent that women's time and efforts are equally valuable, paving the way for a more balanced societal view on gender roles.

Effective management of household tasks through joint efforts can also yield additional benefits. For instance, when both partners collaboratively plan and execute chores, it reduces stress for both parties, allowing each to relax and recharge after work. This arrangement can lead to improved family dynamics, as there is less potential for conflict over unevenly distributed responsibilities. Additionally, it provides a learning opportunity for children who grow up observing this equitable model, ingraining the values of fairness and cooperation from an early age.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the division of household responsibilities is a logical approach in dual-income households. It reinforces notions of gender equality and empowerment while promoting healthier and more balanced family dynamics. Therefore, it is imperative for both men and women to engage in household work, ensuring a cohesive and supportive environment.",8.0
"some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is thought by some that a university education is a stepping stone to building up a lucrative  employment status in life, while other groups believe that getting a job directly after school education is the better option . Although tertiary studies can reinforce the future career development of an individual , in my opinion , I affirm that the interested students must be promoted to start working straight away after acquiring their basic education.Let us discuss this in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.

To begin with, let us shed light on the argument that higher education is crucial for a better future. First and foremost, most professionals are highly qualified. In addition, the doctors, engineers or whoever decorating the higher positions in the society are well qualified with graduation and post-graduation certificates  that made them  lead a successful and satisfactory career in their life. For example, in India the staff members of the schools are categorised as principals, teachers, administrators and other lower grade positions are employed based on their academic qualifications which include the level of their degrees that helped them to create a successful pathway.

On the other hand, there are certain points to support the decision of working without university qualifications. Primarily, personal skills are the building blocks of a successful staff member in his organisation. Moreover, leadership qualities, time management, emotional intelligence and collaboration and cooperation among a team are playing a crucial role in the achievements of a staff member. For instance, the success behind the Microsoft company is the patience and leadership qualities of Bill Gates rather than his tertiary qualifications.

In conclusion, the overall development of a successful career is the subtotal of educational certificates and the innate characteristics of an individual. In my point of view, the factors behind a rewarding career are decided by the personal interest of a person whether he or she is affiliated with studies or would like to cultivate their personal  skills.",3,6.5,"Thank you for providing your essay.

Some propose that a university or college education serves as the ultimate gateway to professional success, while others advocate for immediate entry into the workforce post-high school. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives, presenting my viewpoint on why starting a career directly after high school can be a strategic choice, albeit with some caveats.

To begin with, obtaining higher education is widely regarded as an essential requirement for various career paths. Highly demanding professional fields, such as engineering, medicine, and law, necessitate extensive academic qualifications. These credentials not only offer specialized knowledge but also signify a level of dedication and professionalism. Furthermore, a university education can enhance critical thinking and expose individuals to diverse fields, therefore broadening their horizons. For instance, many leading academicians and professionals attribute their career progress to advanced degrees and the university experience that cultivated critical skills such as analytical thinking and problem-solving.

Conversely, there is merit to the belief that entering the workforce right after high school can be advantageous. This approach nurtures real-world skills that are often not covered in formal education. Financial independence, gaining practical experience, and the swiftness in climbing up the career ladder are immediate benefits of early employment. Notable entrepreneurs who flourished without a formal degree often emphasize the importance of innate skills such as leadership, adaptability, and emotional intelligence over academic success. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, is a prominent example, having paved a remarkable career pathway with his vision and technical acumen, not solely relying on tertiary education qualifications.

From my perspective, the decision should hinge on the individual's career aspirations, personal strengths, and the nature of the industry they wish to pursue. While academic qualifications serve as stepping stones for some professions, personal skills and early work experiences can be invaluable in others. For those students who exhibit entrepreneurial spirit, a direct transition into hands-on professional experience may suit better, enabling them to hone their innate skills swiftly.

In conclusion, both higher education and immediate employment post-school offer unique advantages tailored to different career aspirations. While the comprehensive nature of university education aligns well with certain career paths, the immediate application of skills in a work environment offers insight and growth catering specifically to talent-driven industries. Students need to weigh the pros and cons of each path concerning their ultimate career goals, financial situation, and predispositions. Such strategic decisions set the groundwork for a satisfying and successful career.",8.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?","In this cut throat competition, every person wants to become a rich and wealthy. So some would like to do job in their teenage life, whereas some people wants to get proper knowledge in some particular field. I would like to mention here that both the opinion is good as so many people are well known without getting a bachelors degreedegree. But in my opinion education is key for success.

Firstly, Nowadays, as I mention education is required for success and for a better future. Because if you have any degree then you can simply apply for the position and then you have an option of showing your talent or any extra skill which might lead you to the upper position but if you do not have degree then this not an easy task.  Secondly, there is immense benefit of doing university and college like, at the age of 20 person have enough maturity to decide which is the right path and suitable to his/her skill. In addition, person becomes a focus-oriented as he/she already spent 3-4 years in one field so, they started admiring so many people from their field and they got confidence to do the hard workwork. 

Thirdly, as per recent trend so many colleges and university students get direct placement in there final year, so without even wasting a single day they have job offer and they can start earning. Also, some courses have compulsory internship and sometimes they got an opportunity to work in a multinational company so they got enough experience as well in their field although they got very less money in the form of stipend still it worth after one year of completion when they get job offer with good package.

However, the phenomenon of doing job directly after school is faltering but there are so many successful people in the world whose earning is way more than educated person. For example Sachin Tendulkar, who know as a God cricket, he doesn't have any degree after ten, but his firm determination and hard work made him number one in his field. AS well as so many people wants to join their parents' business and don't want to waste their three or four in education. One signal paper cannot decide your future, just like that if you give 100% in any field and do constant hard work you can get success.

Nutshell, I would like to say that there are enormous benefits if you get a proper degree and tad benefit if you do not have proper degree but still no one can stop you from becoming a successful if you give your heart and soul in a particular fieldfield.",2,5.5,"To elevate your essay from a 5.5 to an 8.0, here are some targeted recommendations across the four key IELTS writing evaluation areas:

While some assert that pursuing a university or college education is paramount, others believe that entering the workforce immediately post-school presents a more effective route to career success. Both perspectives offer significant considerations, and in this discussion, I will explore each view before presenting my own stance.

Starting with the perspective that favours immediate employment, proponents argue that early entry into the job market allows individuals to gain practical experience, which can be invaluable for career advancement. Many successful individuals have thrived without formal education. Take for instance, Sachin Tendulkar, frequently revered as a cricket legend, whose success is attributed to his extraordinary talent and perseverance, rather than academic qualifications. Additionally, those who opt to join family enterprises straight after school have the advantage of learning the ropes of the business early on, thereby saving time and potentially achieving business acumen at an accelerated pace. These paths underscore the idea that, with determination and hard work, success is attainable outside formal academia.

On the other hand, attending university or college is often viewed as the stepping stone to a prosperous career. With a degree, individuals possess the qualifications to apply for a wide range of positions, thus increasing their chances of securing employment in their desired field. Higher education institutions provide in-depth knowledge and foster critical skills, such as analytical thinking and problem-solving, which are pivotal in today's competitive job market. Furthermore, universities often facilitate internships or co-op programs, which offer students practical experience and sometimes lead directly to job offers upon graduation. This structured environment not only enhances one’s knowledge but also boosts confidence and work readiness.

In synthesizing these viewpoints, while immediate employment provides practical experience and can lead to early career entry, it may sometimes lack the comprehensive expertise and qualifications that university education offers. Conversely, higher education can equip individuals with essential skills, qualifications, and confidence, enhancing their competitive edge in the job market. However, it is crucial to recognize that for some professions, such as medicine and law, advanced education is imperative.

In conclusion, although both routes have their merits, I believe that pursuing higher education offers a more holistic preparation for a successful career, particularly in knowledge-based industries. Education enriches individuals both personally and professionally, laying a strong foundation upon which to build a rewarding career. Nonetheless, it is critical for individuals to choose a path that aligns with their personal goals and aspirations, as success ultimately hinges on passion and perseverance regardless of the route taken.",8.0
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"There is no denying fact that, in recent time some individuals prefers having offsprings at children at older age. In my opinion, it is a positive  development because couple solidify their relationship before the arrival of their kids also they Will cease the opportunity to improve their income. Rasing children late might be stressful because they are out of job.

On one hand, some people believe that arrival of youngsters might distance them from their lover, so they build bond before children started coming. In addition, some couple claimed that wealth should be first thing in relationship in other to build financial security for their kids. For instance, my niece did not start having babies until after 5 years of marriage, in which they claimed working hard to earn  more money before arrival of their offspring, and this made them stable financially. Moreso, some people believe maturity is essential before having children and maturity comes with age.

On the other hand, as having offsprings as an individual get older has upper hand, it also has downside. Having children at older age may cause medical complications to the mother and the baby. In 2021, A survey  carried out by midwives in Lagos State Nigeria, reveal that , some maternal complications is  as a result of having babies from thirty five years and above. Another thing,is that raising children at older age might be financial burdens due to retirement.

In conclusion, although bearing newborn as one get older has good side but, such as financial stability, creating good relationship among couple and maturity, but it might cause , prenatal and postnatal problems and financial hardship due to lack of job.",5,5.5,"To improve your essay and reach the desired score of 8.0, let's focus on several key areas:

With continued practice and refinement, you can reach your desired score.","In today’s rapidly evolving society, the decision to have children at older ages has become increasingly common. This trend has sparked a fascinating debate regarding its advantages and disadvantages. While concerns regarding potential health complications and financial burdens in later life are valid, I believe that the benefits of having children at a mature age—such as increased emotional stability, financial preparedness, and personal maturation—far outweigh the drawbacks.

First and foremost, one key advantage of postponing parenthood is the cultivation of a stronger relationship between partners. As couples delay having children, they gain the opportunity to solidify their bond, which is crucial for providing a stable environment for their future offspring. With more time to nurture their relationship, they can engage in activities that strengthen their partnership, creating a secure family foundation. For example, couples can travel or pursue shared interests that enrich their understanding of each other, fostering a harmonious home life when they eventually choose to start a family.

Moreover, from a financial perspective, delaying childbirth often allows individuals the opportunity to enhance their economic stability. In contemporary society, attaining a higher level of education and climbing the career ladder often require significant time investments. By waiting to have children, individuals can focus on advancing their careers, thereby increasing their earning potential. As a result, they are better positioned to provide for their children’s needs and ensure financial security. For instance, a couple who dedicates their early years to career growth is likely to accumulate sufficient savings to support their child’s education, health, and leisure activities.

It is also worth considering that age often brings wisdom and maturity, qualities that can significantly influence the parenting experience. Parents who have reached a certain level of maturity are typically more patient and equipped to make informed decisions regarding their children's upbringing. They tend to possess a better understanding of themselves and the world, enabling them to navigate the complexities of parenthood with greater confidence and foresight. This maturity can lead to a more thoughtful approach, ensuring a nurturing environment for the child’s development.

Nonetheless, it cannot be ignored that giving birth at an older age does carry medical risks. Studies have shown that women who conceive over the age of 35 face higher complications during pregnancy and childbirth. However, with advancements in medical technology and prenatal care, these risks can often be managed effectively. Further, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can mitigate many health concerns linked with later pregnancies.

In conclusion, while challenges exist when deciding to have children later in life, such as possible health issues, the benefits, including fortified relationships, financial stability, and personal growth, decidedly tip the scale in favor of this choice. Ultimately, the decision must be personal, taking into account individual circumstances, but the potential advantages are significant and offer compelling reasons for deferring parenthood.",8.0
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued by many people that the increasing price of material is the most effective method to address worldwide environmental issues. However, I tend to believe that it is not the most effective way since it may cause other problematic issues for the population of the world.

To begin with, vehicles are considered  one of the major factors leading to environmental problems such as air pollution. As cars exhaust toxic fumes, they present dire threats to the natural world. Nevertheless, people are unwilling to stop driving private cars, even realizing the aftermath of the overconsumption of petrol. Thus, growth in the cost of fuel will not cut down global demand for petrol in order to eradicate environmental problems.

On the other hand,a rise in the price of fuel can lead to a  multitude of difficulties for some countries. First of all, it might have an adverse impact on the economy, which will generate challenging circumstances for population. As the cost of petrol increases, it will cause utility bills to rise, such as electricity, water or gas. Furthermore,a  growth in the cost of living may pose financial hardships to people, which even can result in the rise in the unemployment rate. Lastly, rising fuel costs can have a detrimental effect on the airline industry. It is undeniable that ticket prices and additional fees will rise because of the increase in the cost of airline fuel. As a consequence, the number of passengers who want to travel by air might decrease.

To conclude, increasing the cost of fuel is not the most reasonable way to resolve environmental issues. In my opinion, there are some alternative options to address environmental problems by raising people’s awareness about this global emergency.It is argued by many people that the increasing price of material is the most effective method to address worldwide environmental issues.

1. Task Response:
The essay provides a relevant response to the prompt by discussing why increasing fuel prices may not be the most effective solution to environmental problems. However, it could be improved by providing more examples or exploring alternative methods for resolving environmental issues. You briefly mentioned raising awareness as one alternative, but expanding on other solutions such as promoting public transport, investing in renewable energies, or enforcing stricter emissions regulations would strengthen your argument. It would also be beneficial to clarify what you mean by ""the increasing price of material"" in the introduction, as this is a bit ambiguous.

2. Coherence and Cohesion:
The essay is generally well-organized and coherent, with a clear distinction between the opposing viewpoints. However, some transitions between ideas can be more fluid. For example, instead of starting a new paragraph with ""On the other hand,"" try to create a seamless connection between the points made. Using linking words such as ""additionally,"" ""moreover,"" or ""furthermore"" could help maintain a logical flow. The repetition of certain sections across the essay may have been unintended, so ensure you carefully proofread to avoid such duplications. 

3. Lexical Resource:
Your vocabulary choice is appropriate for the task, but there is room for improvement by incorporating more varied and precise words. Instead of repeatedly using phrases like ""growth in the cost of living,"" consider synonyms or rephrasing to demonstrate a stronger lexical range. Additionally, be cautious of word choice, such as using ""material"" rather than ""fuel"" or ""petrol"" in your introduction, which can cause confusion or ambiguity. Also, double-check for small errors such as ""dire threats"" which could be more effectively expressed as ""serious threats.""

4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
The essay demonstrates a good grasp of grammatical structures but is marred by minor errors that could be easily corrected. For instance, proper spacing in phrases such as ""on the other hand, a rise"" instead of ""on the other hand,a rise"" is important for clarity. Similarly, ensure agreement between subjects and verbs, like ""for population"" should be ""for the population."" Consistency in tense and pluralization is also essential for clarity and precision.

Overall Suggestions and Improvements:
- Introduce more detailed examples or case studies to support your arguments.
- Expand on alternative solutions, offering a wider perspective on addressing environmental issues.
- Enhance the coherence by refining paragraph transitions and ensuring a smooth flow between ideas.
- Elevate your lexical resource by varying your vocabulary and avoiding repetitive phrasing.
- Carefully proofread to identify and rectify grammatical errors and awkward phrasings.

Overall Summary:
Your essay presents a clear position on the matter, but can elevate to the desired score of 8.0 by providing more varied vocabulary, detailed support for your arguments, and further exploration of potential solutions. Attend to minor grammatical details and coherence to improve overall fluidity and precision. With these enhancements, your writing can achieve greater impact and clarity.","The issue of resolving environmental challenges remains urgent and multifaceted. Among the proposed solutions, some argue that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is an effective measure. While I acknowledge the environmental incentives behind this viewpoint, I strongly believe that it reflects only a partial solution and could lead to broader social and economic repercussions.

Primarily, it is undeniable that the transportation sector significantly contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Higher fuel prices might discourage excessive usage of personal vehicles, thereby marginally reducing pollution levels. However, this approach overlooks the fundamental need for systematic solutions that can sustainably mitigate environmental damage. For one, investing in the promotion and improvement of public transportation systems can offer a viable alternative to private vehicle use. Efficient, reliable, and sustainable public transport can encourage more people to leave their cars at home, significantly minimizing fossil fuel consumption and reducing emissions comprehensively.

Moreover, the adoption and expansion of renewable energy sources promise a more long-term impact by addressing environmental issues at their very root. Supporting research and development in electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind energy could revolutionize the energy landscape, offering cleaner alternatives that directly cut down carbon footprints across various sectors.

Raising the cost of fuel could inadvertently inflict economic strain, especially on low-income households or economically fragile nations. An increase in fuel prices typically leads to broader inflationary effects, leading to higher transportation, production, and utility costs. Consequently, everyday expenses such as food and heating could become unaffordable for many, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.

In addition, if airline fuel costs rise substantially, the aviation industry might suffer from reduced demand, affecting tourism and global business. These interconnected economic setbacks could potentially outweigh any marginal environmental benefits, thus requiring a more balanced and targeted strategy.

In conclusion, while increasing fuel costs may offer some indirect environmental benefits, it is not the most comprehensive or equitable solution to address our global ecological crisis. A multifaceted approach that includes the promotion of public transport, investment in renewable energy, and the improvement of fuel-efficient technologies provides a more holistic and sustainable path forward. Equally crucial is the role of education and awareness in cultivating eco-friendly practices among individuals and communities worldwide. By looking beyond surface-level solutions, we stand a better chance of preserving the environment for future generations.",8.0

This growing interest is evident in several countries and can be attributed to a variety of reasons. Alongside this curiosity, people are seeking effective ways to conduct research on the historical background of their properties.

One prominent reason for this burgeoning interest is the desire for personal safety and security. Homeowners are keen to learn whether any criminal activities have been associated with their property in the past. For example, if a house was previously occupied by someone involved in illegal activities, such as drug dealing, the new residents might feel apprehensive about the potential risks. Understanding the history of a property's past owners and any notorious events can provide a sense of reassurance and help homeowners protect their families better.

Moreover, the architectural and cultural value of a building often sparks curiosity. People are interested in the unique architectural elements or the cultural significance a building may hold. Knowing that their home is a historical landmark or part of a significant cultural heritage can enhance the pride of ownership and motivate individuals to preserve its originality. This connection to history acts as a compelling reason for individuals to delve into the past.

Researching the history of a property can be approached through various methods. To begin with, engaging with neighbors who may have lived in the area for a significant amount of time can provide valuable insights. These community members often possess oral histories, anecdotes, or even direct knowledge of past events associated with the property. Such interactions not only yield helpful information but also foster community relationships.

Additionally, public records serve as a fundamental resource for researching property history. Visiting local libraries or government offices to examine property records can reveal the chronological chain of ownership, previous occupants, and even historical architecture or renovation details. Furthermore, the internet is a powerful tool for accessing archival data, images, and news articles that might be relevant to the property in question.

Professional services also offer a reliable avenue for conducting thorough research. Historical societies and professional historians often have access to extensive databases and archives that are not available to the general public. Leveraging their expertise can result in detailed reports about the history of a home, its significance, and any noteworthy past events.

In conclusion, the interest in uncovering the history of homes and buildings is fueled by factors such as personal security concerns, architectural interest, and cultural significance. The means to research such history are plentiful, ranging from direct community engagement to the use of public records and professional services. This quest for historical knowledge not only satisfies curiosity but also strengthens the emotional connection between individuals and the spaces they inhabit, highlighting the importance of understanding one's surroundings from both historical and personal perspectives.",8.0
Some people think technology makes life complex so we should make our life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent days, a topic has aroused heated debate in society about whether modern technology has made life more complicated. Some people think that if we don't use technology, our life might be easier and simpler. In my opinion, this is a complete pipe dream.

Technology is certainly not the real reason for complicating human life, but it is the most effective way to make it less complicated. For those who view technological improvement in a misunderstood way, the emergence of various high-tech products has made our lives unnecessarily complicated, and we have to spend time learning new technologies. Our brains make it impossible for us to do things easily, but we are confused by appearances and blame it all on the development of technology. Human civilization forces our lives to be complicated. No matter how technologically developed we are, we have to deal with overpopulation, resource shortages, or environmental pressures and figure out ways to solve them.

On the other hand, we are now so used to relying on modern technology that I can't imagine how we and our descendants would struggle in a world without modern transportation, tall buildings, or communication apps. Despite their flaws, they are the most suitable solutions ever conceived of for all the current problems that human beings face while going through an increasing population society.

Personally, I strongly disagree with this perspective. Technology, rather than complicating life, streamlines and simplifies various aspects of our daily routines.

To begin with, technology has undeniably transformed communication. The advent of the internet and smartphones has made it easier to connect with others across the globe, bridging geographical divides and facilitating instant interaction. This technological leap has simplified personal and professional communications, allowing people to connect with family, friends, and colleagues at any given moment, regardless of distance.

Moreover, technology substantially enhances healthcare quality. Cutting-edge medical devices and telemedicine services have streamlined patient diagnosis and treatment processes. Patients receive faster, more accurate diagnoses, which in turn reduces hospital wait times and improves overall healthcare delivery. Such advancements reflect how technology simplifies complicated medical procedures for both providers and patients.

Equally important is the role of technology in education. Modern educational tools, such as interactive software and online resources, provide learners with a more engaging and flexible learning experience. Students can access vast amounts of information and educational materials online, thereby removing barriers to education and making learning more accessible and efficient.

While it is true that adapting to new technologies requires an initial investment of time and resources, the long-term benefits far outweigh these efforts. Concerns about over-dependency on technology are legitimate; however, by embracing technology wisely and responsibly, we can use it to our advantage without letting it dominate our lives.

In conclusion, while some argue that stepping back from technology would simplify life, the advantages it offers in communication, healthcare, and education illustrate its essential role in making life more manageable. Rather than abandoning technology, it is crucial to strike a balance where we leverage its benefits to address the complexities of modern life effectively.",8.0

The rampant deforestation, pollution, and climate change have led to the extinction of numerous species – an irreversible loss of biodiversity. Those who share this viewpoint believe that any further interventions would merely result in financial burdens without yielding constructive environmental outcomes.

Conversely, there is a compelling argument that insists it's never too late to act and that Ttaking strategic steps now can still yield significant positive impacts on the environment. This perspective emphasizes the resilience of nature which, when given the chance, can slowly recover from human-induced stress. By implementing strict regulations against deforestation, preserving natural habitats, investing in renewable energy, and combating pollution, we can slow down or reverse the detrimental effects of our actions. Additionally, legal frameworks that punish offenders and incentivize conservation efforts are already showing promising results in some parts of the world.

In my opinion, while the challenges ahead are undeniably daunting, we cannot afford to resign to defeat. The consequences of inaction would be catastrophic for both current and future generations. History has shown us that humanity is capable of coming together to address global challenges, and this scenario should be no exception. By acting decisively now, we bolster our hope for restoring balance to our ecosystems and ensuring the survival of diverse species, ultimately safeguarding our own future here on Earth.

In conclusion, despite the severity of environmental degradation caused by human activities, it is possible and essential to take meaningful action towards remedying the situation. As custodians of our planet, we have a responsibility to mitigate the harm caused and pursue sustainable practices that support both human advancement and biodiversity conservation.",8.0
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Lately, the tax payers are wondering where their money goes and they believe that their money is not well invested. As a result, some argue that they should not pay any taxes to the government. I totally agree with this approach and I will explain the reasons why.

The aim of the taxes is to contribute economically to the developments of the communities. A significant part of the citizens salary is taken in order to keep parks clean, to build new roads, schools and hospitals. In addition, this wage is used to support people who do not have an income or a place to live. Some public services like the police and the fireman get their support for it. Without this system these services might fail. For example, police cars, defensive equipments and salary come from the tax money. 

However, although the money of the taxes is essential for these aspects, the tax payers argue that their money is not well invested. Despite of the big amount of fund generated from the taxes, some communities and services do not witness any single improvements or investments. Public sectors like education and health presence a dismiss from the government. These sectors barely survive with the capital provided by the government. Moreover, some presidents spend the tax money to travel and for their personal benefit. Furthermore, people are paying an excessive amount of money in taxes regardless their low salary income. As a consequence, their income after paying taxes is not sufficient to afford their daily expenses.

In conclusion, the tax payment should be waived, if the money is not invested in the community. In the future, it is pretty likely that more people become poor because tax payments.",9,6.5,"To reach your desired score of 8.0, let's go through each aspect of your essay step by step:

While it's understandable why some might harbor these sentiments, I disagree with this notion, as taxes serve a pivotal role in the functioning of society by funding essential services. In this essay, I will argue that rather than abolishing taxes, more transparency and effective allocation are necessary to ensure public support.

To begin with, taxes are fundamental in supporting the infrastructure and services that underpin modern life. Public goods, such as education, healthcare, transport infrastructure, and emergency services, are predominantly funded by taxpayers' money. For instance, the roads we travel on daily, the police force ensuring community safety, and public hospitals providing care are all financed by taxes. The absence of such contributions could result in a decline in public service quality, harming societal welfare and leading to negative externalities.

However, the growing sentiment of dissatisfaction among taxpayers is often due to perceived government inefficiency and lack of transparency in fund allocation. Many believe that their earnest contributions are mismanaged or worse, squandered. For example, reports of misappropriation where substantial sums have been diverted inappropriately have fostered public distrust. Addressing this issue involves both better financial oversight and communication from governments about how tax revenues are utilized and the tangible benefits of these expenditures.

Critically examining the alternative, the elimination of taxes could exacerbate social inequality. Without redistributive taxation, the state cannot effectively support welfare programs that assist the less fortunate sectors of society. Furthermore, without public funding, education and healthcare disparities could widen, placing the burden squarely on individuals to finance these fundamentals, which could further marginalize the economically disadvantaged.

In conclusion, while there is merit to the argument for keeping personal earnings in totality, it is more beneficial to ensure that taxes are managed responsibly and transparently. Instead of abolishing taxes, efforts should focus on improving governmental transparency and accountability, thus restoring public trust. Ensuring that taxes are appropriately channeled toward public utility must remain a priority to guarantee societal progress and cohesion.",8.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is a common belief that the best way discovering how to survive with climate change rather than preventing. I will elaborate this with supporting by inhibiting climate change.


In the modern life, the technology and consuming more than need is the essential reason  of climate change. Day by day, the ice where in the North is decreasing, also the temparature is rising. Over the years, all the scientists who research about methodology and environment sign to eliminate climate change. Obviously, the measurements cannot utilize to  the world a better place. For example, in a small town, all the cars and production centres have restricted since 2018 in my city. However, air pollution or other healing process in the environment has not appeared anymore. That is to say, the authorities should manage with more effective precautions. I will agree that if the people take care about climate change and solutions, all humanity will survive without any concern.


On the other hand, another belief supports living with the climate change may be supply benefits to us. Therefore, everybody can focus and adapt to new temperature or other change. Although, when it has not inhibited, it has been never ended. To rise temperature is a serious issue for the living organism. Even if they adapt these type of change, some type of organism cannot exist to suffer with a high temperature. Due to, the balance of the ecosystem can not heal, many of insects, birds, reptile will not have been in the new habitat.

While this perspective may hold some merit in terms of immediate practicality, I firmly disagree with this viewpoint. I believe that proactive measures to combat climate change are crucial to prevent its existential threats and ensure a sustainable future for all living organisms.

Firstly, it is evident that climate change, primarily driven by human activities such as excessive consumption and technological proliferation, has catastrophic impacts worldwide. Ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. This severe shift poses a direct threat to ecosystems, agriculture, and human habitation. For example, in regions like my hometown, initiatives since 2018 have limited the use of vehicles and certain production processes to curtail local pollution levels. Although the effects on air quality have been modest, a global collective effort with stringent regulations could yield more significant outcomes. Therefore, governments and global organizations should prioritize prevention through policies that reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable practices.

On the other hand, proponents of adaptation argue that learning to live with climate change could have potential benefits, such as developing resilience to altered weather patterns. However, the assumption that adaptation can be a standalone solution overlooks the irreversible damage climate change can inflict on biodiversity. Rising temperatures threaten many species unprepared for such rapid changes, disturbing the ecological balance and resulting in loss of flora and fauna that form the backbone of planetary ecosystems. For instance, without effective preventive measures, entire species, including insects, birds, and reptiles, may struggle or fail to survive, leading to the collapse of complex food webs.

In conclusion, while adaptation strategies are necessary as part of the immediate response to climate change, they should not replace efforts to address and mitigate the root causes of this global crisis. The fragile nature of our planet demands careful stewardship, and it is imperative that we focus on sustainable solutions to preserve the environment for future generations. Policymakers, scientists, and individuals must collaborate and act decisively to avert the catastrophic consequences of climate change, securing the well-being of both humanity and the myriad other species with which we share the Earth.",8.0

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is believed that climate change can cause negative effect on business in some ways while others think that there are some benefits for business. This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.
	On the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.
	On the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.

While some see climate change as a significant threat, potentially harming businesses, others perceive it as a catalyst for innovation and new business opportunities. This essay will explore both perspectives before offering my own views on this contentious topic.

On one side of the argument, it is undeniable that climate change poses various threats to business operations. To begin with, industries reliant on natural resources, such as agriculture and fisheries, are particularly vulnerable. For example, rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification can severely impact fish populations, threatening the livelihoods of those in the fishing industry. Furthermore, extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods, which are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, can disrupt supply chains, damage infrastructure, and result in significant financial losses for businesses across various sectors. The agricultural industry, too, faces challenges because altered weather patterns can lead to decreased crop yields, impacting food supply and increasing costs.

Moreover, regulatory changes imposed by governments to curb carbon emissions can increase operational costs for companies. Businesses may be required to invest in new technologies to ensure compliance, which can be costly and time-consuming. For instance, strict government policies on carbon emissions can necessitate significant modifications to production processes, which might not be feasible for all businesses, especially smaller enterprises.

Conversely, climate change also presents numerous opportunities for businesses, particularly those that are agile and innovative. The growing demand for sustainable products and green technologies has given rise to entirely new industries. Companies investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are experiencing rapid growth and profitability. Additionally, firms producing energy-efficient appliances and electric vehicles are tapping into a burgeoning market, driven by environmentally-conscious consumers.

Moreover, as public awareness of climate change increases, there is a shift in consumer preferences towards sustainable practices. Businesses adopting eco-friendly policies and practices not only benefit from a positive brand image but also tap into a loyal customer base that values sustainability. Furthermore, tourism can also benefit, as destinations in areas prone to extreme weather conditions may attract tourists looking for less affected, safer alternatives during certain times of the year.

In conclusion, while climate change undeniably poses challenges that can negatively impact businesses, it also carves out numerous avenues for growth and innovation. In my opinion, although businesses must prepare for the adverse effects of climate change, the opportunities for innovation and adaptation offer a promising future. Companies that anticipate changes and invest in sustainable practices are likely to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape. Therefore, it is crucial for businesses to view climate change not just as a threat, but as a chance to innovate and lead in a new world of possibilities.",8.0
"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it is perceived that the effective way to remedy issues relating to the environment is to increase the pump price of gas for vehicles generally. Although some people believe that this move would resolve the environmental crisis, however, I vehemently disagree with that statement. This essay will elaborate that petroleum products such as fuel is not the major cause of climate disasters and increasing the cost price will not yield their intended purpose.

To start with, research has shown that harvesting  trees without replacing them, mining and poor waste management  are the major causes of environmental problems. Besides, if we fail to address  

the aforementioned  causes and concentrate on fuel alone, I am afraid that the situation will be worse in the future. For instance, the government should legislate a law that prohibits the cutting of trees, wrongful disposal of waste and regulate mining companies. Despite the fact that increasing the prices of gas would to some extent aid in protecting the environment, nonetheless, it will not have tremendous a benefit as one may think. 

Moreover, even though an uptrend in the prices of gas to some extent will curb about 10% of environmental problems, that in itself is not sufficient, as it will cause hardship on the people as most of them will resort to other activities such as coal mining which will be detrimental to the environment. To exemplify, in 2021, the authorities in Sierra Leone  increased the cost of fuel from 10,000 Leones to 20,000 Leones per litre in order to discourage vehicle owners from using their cars. Sadly, the transport fare for public transport shot up and the prices of groceries and other goods became a big challenge for its citizens. In addition, curbing fuel in isolation will not be beneficial to the climate. 

In conclusion,  even though some people believe that increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles in my estimation, I totally disagree with that position.",8,6.5,"**Task Response:**

The essay presents a clear position on the topic, which is disagreement with the notion that raising fuel prices can effectively solve environmental problems. However, the discussion lacks depth and focus. To move from a score of 6.5 to 8.0, you need to develop more robust arguments and provide a more comprehensive analysis of why increasing fuel prices may not solve environmental issues. You could consider exploring more alternatives or other elements that contribute significantly to environmental degradation, such as industrial pollution, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, linking the points made to broader environmental policies could enhance the argument.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay's structure is logical, moving from the introduction to body paragraphs and concluding with a summary of the position. However, coherence can be improved by ensuring that each paragraph smoothly connects with the next. The transition between ideas, particularly from introduction to body paragraphs and between examples, could be more seamless. Use more linking phrases, such as ""Furthermore,"" ""Moreover,"" and ""In addition,"" to improve the flow. Also, ensure clarity in the conclusion by restating the reasons for disagreement, thus reinforcing your viewpoint.

**Lexical Resource:**

The essay uses an adequate range of vocabulary, but there is room for improvement by incorporating more sophisticated and precise language related to environmental issues. For instance, terms such as ""emissions,"" ""sustainable practices,"" ""renewable energy sources,"" and ""carbon footprint"" could be integrated to show a higher level of lexical resource. Additionally, varying sentence structures and synonyms to avoid repetition could improve lexical variety and accuracy.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The essay demonstrates a reasonable level of grammatical accuracy, but some errors are present. For example, ""petroleum products such as fuel is"" should be ""petroleum products such as fuel are."" Minor issues like these can detract from clarity. To achieve a higher score, aim to improve sentence variety, ensuring a mix of complex and compound sentences. Additionally, pay attention to subject-verb agreement and punctuation to enhance grammatical range.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Deepen the analysis by exploring more reasons or perspectives on why raising fuel prices may not be the best solution.
2. Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and clear connections between ideas.
3. Use a wider range of vocabulary related to environmental issues.

**Overall Summary:**

To improve to an 8.0 score, focus on developing deeper insights into the topic, using sophisticated language, and improving grammatical precision. With clearer connections between ideas and a broader range of examples and terminologies, your essay will become more compelling and demonstrate a higher level of proficiency. Make these adjustments, and you'll be well on your way to achieving your desired score.","In today's world, one of the proposed solutions to tackle environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. While some individuals support this idea as a means to address environmental concerns, I strongly disagree with this notion. In my view, raising fuel prices is an inadequate approach that overlooks more significant contributors to environmental degradation. This essay will examine why this measure is unlikely to resolve environmental issues and propose more effective alternatives.

To begin with, it is crucial to recognize that fuel consumption in vehicles is only one of the myriad sources contributing to environmental degradation. Major activities such as deforestation, industrial emissions, and agricultural practices have a more substantial and wide-reaching impact on the environment. Deforestation, for instance, results in the loss of biodiversity and a decrease in carbon sequestration, pivotal to maintaining atmospheric balance. Meanwhile, industrial pollution releases harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, exacerbating air quality issues and contributing to global warming. Thus, focusing solely on fuel price hikes fails to tackle these fundamental causes.

Moreover, increasing fuel costs might have unintended socio-economic impacts that could undermine global efforts to protect the environment. Higher oil prices can lead to increased transportation costs, which would inflate the prices of goods and services, adversely affecting lower-income populations. Faced with rising costs, many individuals might resort to using traditional sources of energy like coal or wood, which can, in fact, increase air pollution and carbon emissions. An example can be drawn from India, where a sudden rise in fuel prices prompted a surge in coal usage, inadvertently leading to a spike in pollution levels.

An alternative and more sustainable solution would be investing in and promoting renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and providing subsidies or incentives for green technology can gradually transition societies towards a low-carbon economy and reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. For instance, Norway’s significant subsidies for electric cars have notably increased EV adoption, decreasing overall emissions.

Furthermore, implementing stringent regulations to control industrial emissions, incentivizing reforestation, and using sustainable agricultural practices could greatly enhance environmental conservation efforts. Adopting these multi-pronged strategies ensures a broad-spectrum approach to handling environmental challenges and promotes sustainable development without severely impacting societal welfare.

In conclusion, although increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles might offer a short-term reduction in their usage, it is not a comprehensive solution to environmental problems. Addressing more profound causes like deforestation, industrial emissions, and unsustainable practices, while bolstering renewable energy initiatives, can yield a more impactful and enduring solution for environmental sustainability. Therefore, policymakers should focus on these holistic strategies that provide long-lasting benefits without imposing undue burdens on society.",8.0
"Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animals species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation.

Discuss both sides and give an opinion","Human activity  in every manifestation has a harmful effect on our planet and environment. And the very important and an integral part of our climate system are plants and animals. Everything in our ecosystem has to exist in  harmony. 

 I believe that it is never too late to change something , and we can improve the situation if all the people  work together.  The major problem is that  many humans do not understand that they can change everything only with a few simple measures. For example, people do not have to change their lives to not disturb wildlife, they just must follow the rules like do not drop litter everywhere, use the sorting containers and in forests keep noize to a minimum and  not light a fire.

 I absolutely agree that we are able to change the situation with endangered species of plants and animals, if we  take effective action. Many problems with  wildlife are related to  climate change and global warming. Furthermore, it can be applied to natural disasters such as drought, flood , earthquakes  etc. These catastrophes have a harmful impact on plants and animals, but  all these casualties are caused by human activity, not just by one person. Nowadays, still   industrial companies which are not sustainable enough. They damage our environment and wildlife by exhaust fumes , dumping waste into the ocean and using fossil fuels.

This multifaceted issue has sparked debate, with some individuals advocating the stance that it is too late for remedial actions, while others insist that effective interventions are still within reach to ameliorate the situation. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my own opinion.

On one hand, there are compelling arguments supporting the notion that it is too late to reverse the damage inflicted on ecosystems. Firstly, the extinction of species at an alarming rate indicates irreversible harm; once a species is extirpated, the unique ecological functions it performed fade permanently. Furthermore, the profound alterations caused by climate change, such as melting ice caps and shifting weather patterns, seem daunting and irrevocable. For instance, certain habitats have reached critical tipping points, making restoration a Herculean task beyond human capability. This perspective is often grounded in the recognition of the sheer magnitude and complexity of these ecological challenges.

However, conversely, there are strong arguments in favor of taking proactive measures to mitigate these adverse impacts. Although the scale of damage is significant, no situation is beyond redemption given adequate human effort. Countless case studies demonstrate the efficacy of conservation projects and protective legislation in fostering recovery. Reforestation programs, reintroduction of endangered species, and stringent pollution controls illustrate practical avenues for positive change. Collaborative global initiatives, particularly those aimed at curbing carbon emissions and protecting biodiversity, underscore the capacity of concerted action to yield tangible improvements. A noteworthy example is the gradual resurgence of the ozone layer, which came about due to global commitment to phasing out ozone-depleting substances.

Considering both perspectives, I am inclined to endorse the belief that it is not too late to effectuate meaningful change. While the challenges facing our natural world are indeed formidable, history is replete with instances of rehabilitation and conservation success stories sparked by human intervention. The dire situation necessitates urgent, widespread cooperation and innovative solutions to preserve the remnants of our ecological heritage for future generations.

"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",4,6.5,"To enhance your essay and aim for a higher band score, let's focus on various components of your writing:

This movement can be attributed to various factors, including the pursuit of better employment opportunities, improved education, and enhanced lifestyle amenities. As urban centers strain under the pressure of population density, it's imperative to identify the causes and implement effective measures to reverse this migration pattern.

Foremost among the causes is the lure of greater job prospects in urban areas. Cities often host the headquarters of major corporations, offer a diverse range of industries, and present better career growth opportunities. For instance, in countries like Japan, cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are hubs for multinational companies, which attract young professionals seeking career advancement. Consequently, rural areas are left with fewer employment options, prompting an exodus to the cities. Similarly, access to superior educational institutions further entices families to urban centers, ensuring their children receive a competitive education.

Moreover, urban living is perceived as offering a superior lifestyle, with access to advanced healthcare, entertainment, and social amenities. This is understandably attractive to younger demographics eager to capitalize on the vibrant city life. However, this creates challenges, including overcrowding, traffic congestion, increased pollution, and a strain on public infrastructure and resources.

To counteract these issues and encourage a movement back towards rural areas, a multifaceted approach is necessary. One effective method could be decentralizing job opportunities by incentivizing companies to establish offices and factories in rural regions through tax breaks or subsidies. This would simultaneously boost local economies and provide residents with viable employment options without necessitating relocation to cities.

Additionally, improving rural infrastructure is crucial. By investing in robust transportation networks, high-speed internet, and quality healthcare facilities, rural areas would become more attractive for both individuals and businesses. Promotion of digital work environments, such as remote working arrangements, can further facilitate living in the countryside, as evidenced by the rise of remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Finally, fostering cultural and recreational activities in rural locations can enhance their appeal. Developing rural tourism and holding events that celebrate traditional art and heritage may draw visitors and promote long-term residency.

In sum, addressing the causes which drive people towards cities requires a blend of economic incentives, infrastructure development, and cultural investments. These strategies, when effectively implemented, can help balance population distribution and alleviate pressures on urban environments while simultaneously revitalizing rural communities. Such efforts will ensure sustainable and balanced growth across regions, ultimately benefitting society as a whole.",8.0

Dedicated practice with a focus on these components will aid in reaching your desired score of 8.0.","In today's increasingly competitive world, academic success is undoubtedly essential. However, it is not the only aspect that schools should focus on. While some individuals believe that students should learn pragmatic skills like cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork from family and friends, I strongly oppose the idea that schools should neglect these subjects. Instead, I advocate for their inclusion in the school curriculum as they play a pivotal role in providing a well-rounded education.

To begin with, integrating practical skills such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork into the educational system prepares students for real-life situations. These skills are indispensable for individual self-sufficiency. For instance, cookery not only fosters a healthy lifestyle but also cultivates creativity and patience. Furthermore, woodwork can promote problem-solving skills and innovation, attributes that are highly beneficial in any career. When schools incorporate these subjects, they equip students with essential life skills that are often absent in academic subjects alone.

Moreover, teaching these skills at school enables educators to instill valuable competencies that many families might struggle to provide due to varying levels of expertise or interest. Schools not only offer standardized and structured lessons but also trained professionals who can ensure that students gain the skills in a consistent and effective manner. In addition, learning in a school setting often encourages teamwork, collaboration, and peer learning, which are integral social skills that friends and family may not impart during individual instruction.

On the other hand, while it is acknowledged that some domestic tasks can be taught at home, the truth remains that schools provide a unique platform that combines both theoretical and practical applications. This dual approach can make learning more comprehensive. For example, a student might apply mathematical concepts in measuring ingredients during a cookery class or employ design skills in creating an attractive garment in dressmaking, thus making academic learning more tangible and enriching.

In conclusion, schools should not solely prioritize academic success and examination results. Instead, they should offer a holistic education that includes practical subjects such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork. These skills offer significant advantages that strengthen students' overall development. By teaching them at school, we prepare well-rounded individuals who are equipped to handle diverse challenges in life.",8.0
"Some people believe that time spent on television and computer games can be valuable for children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been a contentious argument over the effect of watching TV and playing computer games on children. This essay examines both points of view and my perspective, being that these activities can be beneficial if the time spent is in moderation. 

 Some hold a firm belief that watching television and playing games on  computers have various benefits. Firstly, these sources of entertainment can enhance  brain development. By interacting with the world through those technologies, either real or artificial, their brains’ functions including spatial-visual reasoning can be boosted subconsciously. Furthermore, after a heavy workload of studying, students should find a stress reliever to provide an escape from information overload, therefore, those kinds of entertainment can be extremely suitable for these situations. 

 However, others raise voices of disapproval by stating that those leisure activities can have a negative influence on their children. This is because of the excessive amount of time spent on playing video games, which eventually leads to addiction. Nowadays the advancement of these sources of vast media has been to the extent that once young and impressional people take part in, they will grow an instant interest, henceforth, it is hard to stop to do other work such as dealing with homework or reviewing the lessons. To illustrate, a single episode of a popular drama film tends to last 1 hour, let alone a whole season; whereas ,in contrast, students only have few hours to both relax and prepare for the next school day.

Good luck!","There is considerable debate regarding the impact of television and computer games on children, with some advocating for their beneficial effects, while others caution against potential negative outcomes. In this essay, I will evaluate these perspectives and provide my insights, arguing that these activities can be advantageous, provided they are enjoyed within reasonable limits.

Proponents of screen-based entertainment suggest that television and computer games can play a vital role in enhancing cognitive abilities. Educational programs and interactive games are designed to facilitate learning, improve spatial awareness, and strengthen problem-solving skills. For example, studies by cognitive psychologists have shown that strategic video games can enhance the brain's capacity for multitasking and decision-making. In addition, television programs around the world broadcast educational content that helps children learn new concepts in engaging ways. Furthermore, these activities are excellent outlets for relieving stress. In today's academically demanding environment, children often need relaxing downtime, and engaging with TV shows or video games can provide this necessary reprieve, allowing them to return to their studies revitalized.

On the other hand, critics argue that excessive exposure to these forms of entertainment can lead to adverse effects. One primary concern is addiction, where prolonged and uncontrolled use can detract from children's responsibilities, such as homework and physical activities. The immersive nature of video games and addictive plotlines in TV series can absorb children entirely, leaving little room for other productive engagements. An apt illustration of this is the tendency of children to binge-watch entire seasons of popular TV shows, squandering hours that could otherwise be spent on enriching pursuits or social interactions.

In conclusion, both viewpoints bring valuable insights to the table. While the detriments of overindulgence should not be underestimated, the cognitive and stress-relief potential of television and computer games cannot be overlooked. I contend that with parental guidance and structured time limits, these activities can yield meaningful benefits and contribute positively to a child's development. Therefore, a balanced approach where screen time is moderated and integrated with diverse educational and physical activities should be promoted.",8.0
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old.

Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","There is a strong believe that the government ought to look after and support people while they retired. However, not everybody share the same point of view and they assume that every single person is responsible for own future. In my opinion, both groups have right, nevertheless, the authority should support own citizens especially after they hardly earned the future pension.

Firstly, every single country has set the length of work time, which can give a right to get the minimal pension. Average person works much longer than that, to get higher amount of money, which will let them afford level of life they used to it. Moreover, it would be unfair when the government could not pay back or support them when they get old. It is their responsibility to save some part of money to be able offer them to the older population. 

On the other hand, the opponents claims that every individual need to save own money on a separate bank account for future. In addition, they do not have any trust in the further authority plans and advise to have a backup plan. I will probably listen to them because we do not know what may happen in the next decade. Surprisingly, saving just 10% of our monthly wage can give a boost of money available on our retirement. 

To sum up, I believe we should have trust in the country where we live and politics, however, can not boycott people who are afraid of their future.

However, your opinion needs to be more clearly articulated and consistently supported throughout the essay. Start with a clear thesis statement in the introduction that indicates your position on the issue. Develop your arguments with detailed examples and evidence to provide a balanced discussion. For instance, you could mention how government schemes could offer security, while individual savings can provide flexibility.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - While your essay has a coherent structure, the flow of ideas can be improved. Use clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to highlight the main point.

To improve clarity, ensure that each paragraph logically builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless narrative throughout the essay.

3. **Lexical Resource:**

Use precise language to express your ideas clearly and concisely. It might be helpful to learn vocabulary related to economic policies and retirement planning.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
   - The essay presents several grammatical errors which detract from readability. Pay close attention to singular/plural agreements, such as ""a strong believe"" should be ""a strong belief,"" and ""everybody share"" should be ""everybody shares."" Work on your article usage (""the,"" ""a,"" and ""an"") and ensure proper subject-verb agreement. To showcase a broad grammatical range, integrate complex sentences correctly.

By refining these areas through focused practice and revision, and employing varied vocabulary and complex grammatical structures, you can improve your essay to meet the IELTS criteria more effectively. Keep practicing, and best of luck with your preparation!","In today's society, the issue of who bears the responsibility for supporting people financially after retirement remains a topic of heated debate. Some argue that it is the government's duty to ensure that individuals have a secure and stable income after they stop working, while others contend that individuals should be accountable for saving money to support themselves during their golden years. In my opinion, a balanced approach that incorporates both government support and individual responsibility is the most effective way to ensure a financially stable retirement.

Proponents of government responsibility assert that after dedicating years of hard work to their professions, individuals deserve to be taken care of by the government. Most countries have established pension systems to provide a basic level of income for retirees, and many people work beyond the minimum requirements to increase their pension benefits. Consequently, it is only fair that the state reciprocates by delivering financial security to its aging population. Government-provided pension schemes can offer a sense of security and certainty, knowing that a guaranteed income will be available regardless of individual financial acumen. This social safety net ensures that all citizens, irrespective of their work history or income level, can enjoy a dignified retirement.

On the other hand, those who argue for personal responsibility emphasize the importance of individual financial planning. Given the uncertainty of future governmental policies and the potential insufficiency of state pensions, individuals are advised to build their own savings and investments. Relying solely on governmental support may not guarantee a comfortable retirement, as inflation and political shifts can impact pension values. Saving as little as 10% of one’s monthly income in a personal retirement account can provide additional financial flexibility and independence, offering individuals the freedom to maintain their desired standard of living once they retire.

In conclusion, a dual approach that combines governmental pensions and personal savings is ideal for ensuring financial security in retirement. While it is crucial for governments to uphold their obligations toward citizens, individuals must also proactively manage their finances to safeguard against economic uncertainties. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility, both the state and individuals can contribute to a stable and prosperous retirement period.",8.0

How it affects them on how they live? In this essay, I will discuss in details why I agree that well known people cannot live freely. 

To begin with, the celebrities are role models that people are idolizing and fantasizing them. Some of them are acting what the community want to see. They need to be pretty, well mannered and glamorous for them to be loved and accepted. Nowadays, because of social media people are easy to access them, thus they can follow them and some can be connected to them. In addition, it is true that anyone can publicise them with a photo or video that can be taken on their mobile phones.

While some argue that dealing with this intrusion is an inherent part of fame, I believe that celebrities, like all individuals, deserve a certain degree of privacy and respect. This essay will delve into both perspectives and provide a balanced argument on why the media should exercise restrain in handling the personal affairs of public figures.

To start with, it is undeniable that celebrities' lives generate immense public interest. They are admired and scrutinized for their talent, lifestyle, and even personal decisions. For many fans, celebrities serve as role models, offering inspiration in various aspects of life. This fervent interest often drives the media to delve deeper into the personal lives of these public figures, sometimes crossing ethical boundaries. Proponents of the ""price of fame"" argument suggest that celebrities should accept such scrutiny as they willingly chose professions that come with public attention. In essence, their fame is perceived as a fair trade-off for the incessant media coverage.

On the other hand, the unrestrained invasion of celebrities' privacy can lead to adverse consequences. The 24/7 media attention often subjects celebrities to immense stress and anxiety, with potential repercussions on their mental health. For instance, the infamous incidents involving paparazzi hounding even the most mundane aspects of a celebrity's life have, at times, resulted in dangerous pursuits and untoward incidents. Moreover, the privacy invasion does not end with celebrities themselves; their families, especially children, can become unintended victims of such relentless scrutiny, impacting their well-being.

Furthermore, the media's portrayal can sometimes be distorted, prioritizing sensationalism over truth. This can tarnish the reputation of public figures and lead to unfair judgments from the audience, bringing about public and professional consequences. Ethical journalism should balance the public's right to information with respect for individual privacy and dignity.

In conclusion, while fame may inevitably lead to increased public scrutiny, it is crucial to understand and establish boundaries that protect the personal lives of celebrities. They deserve the grace to navigate personal trials without unwarranted exposure. By fostering a culture of respect and empathy, media platforms can ensure responsible coverage, aligning public interest with ethical standards.",8.0
"Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is a polarizing topic  whether robots will prove to be instrumental to the development of human society in the forthcoming future or vice versa. Personally, although there are a few potential threats coming from the emergence of robotic engineering, I believe that the merits of this form of technology could eclipse its drawbacks. 

Yet it is unequivocally that robotic technology could fall into the wrong hand; therefore, it might be used to conduct immoral activity  or wage a war. For example, in the contemporary combat age, many cutting-edged devices have been adapted to practical combat, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles which are used to strike the enemy from distance. As a result, the life of many residents living in eras located in the war zone has been wreaked havoc as they have to deal with such hazardous confrontations  while worrying about losing their close friends and family. A prime example of this is Afghanistan, a country which has been under influence of America for over a century, citizens with  impoverished living conditions are ubiquitous here, and the waging of war has hindered their economy from thriving. 

However, in  light of robotic technological advances, human civilization has stepped another step into a brighter future, with many significant signs of progress in multi fields namely education, medicine, manufacturing, etc. Compared to  old-time manufacturing, good productivity in automatic factories has out manufactured in the past several times. By applying assembly lines to production, many ingredients could be transported and processed at the same time, which boosts productivity speed to great extent. Regarding the education sector, robotic adaption is the key factor in crafting novel and convenient methods of teaching, robotic lecturers which are programmed for a particular subject could convey detailed knowledge, while tailored-made learning programs enable learners to study at their own pace.

In my opinion, although there are risks associated with the advancement of robotics, the benefits they offer are substantial and should not be overlooked.

Those who view robots as a potential threat argue that robotic technology could easily be misused, leading to negative outcomes such as loss of privacy, loss of jobs, and even militarization. For example, armed drones have already transformed warfare, allowing for remote attacks that can cause significant civilian casualties, as seen in ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. The fear is that robots could be deployed for surveillance purposes, infringing on personal freedoms, or to replace human workers across various industries, increasing unemployment.

Conversely, supporters of robotic advancement point to the tremendous potential for beneficial contributions to diverse sectors such as healthcare, education, and manufacturing. For instance, in healthcare, surgical robots enable precise and minimally invasive procedures, significantly improving patient outcomes. In education, robots can provide personalized learning experiences, adapting to individual student pace and capabilities, while in manufacturing, automated systems streamline production processes, enhancing both speed and efficiency, and ultimately minimizing human error.

In conclusion, while it is important to recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with the rise of robots, their capacity to drive innovation and efficiency across critical sectors cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is crucial to implement robust regulations to mitigate any adverse effects while harnessing the potential of robotic technology to elevate human society into a new era of progress and prosperity.",8.0
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, individuals are need to earn more income to fulfil their requirements therefore they do not need to pay taxes to the government. I strongly agree with the above statement and my justification will come in further paragraphs along with some relative examples.

To commence with, there are several reasons why human beings not need to pay taxes. Firstly, they put extra hours and hardwork to earn money hence they should keep all the money for their better future. For instance, sometimes any misshepling occure that time they easily used their saving for any medical emergency and many more. Secondly, the living expenses of todays lives are very costly to adjust middle class to buy their dream house and car. Thirdly, education system and helathcare both are very expensive to affordable poor people therefore they do not need to pay the government.

Furthermore, individuals are less likely to pay taxes to the administration and used their saving in different fields such as education, healthcare and many more. Moreover, they need to some essential requirements in their life to survive long.

On the other hand, there are many advantages of paying taxes to the state. the government can easily provide them better education, good health infrastrure any many more facilities. Additionally, the state can manage their economy and budget very easily with the help of the money which they received from the local public.

Some individuals assert that children who commit crimes should face punishments, while others argue that the responsibility lies with the parents and they should, therefore, be penalized. This essay will examine both viewpoints and present my opinion on this pressing issue.

On the one hand, proponents of punishing children for their crimes argue that it serves as a deterrent, instilling in them an understanding of accountability and the repercussions of unlawful actions. By holding young offenders accountable, there is a possibility of rehabilitating them through targeted programs such as community service or counseling, which ultimately aids in their reintegration into society as law-abiding citizens. For instance, implementing juvenile detention centers that focus on education and skill development can guide these youngsters towards a more positive path, reducing the likelihood of reoffending.

Conversely, many advocate for parental responsibility, emphasizing that parents are pivotal in shaping their children's behavior and moral compass. They believe that parents should foster an environment conducive to nurturing responsible and empathetic individuals. Failure to do so, resulting in criminal behavior, should warrant punitive measures against the parents. Such measures might include mandatory parenting classes or fines, which could motivate parents to exhibit greater involvement and vigilance in their child's upbringing. This approach also underlines the importance of a supportive and disciplined home environment in preventing juvenile delinquency.

From my standpoint, while both perspectives hold merit, the solution requires a balanced approach. The complexity of juvenile crime means that no single entity—children, parents, or society—should bear full responsibility. Addressing juvenile crime should involve assessing individual cases to determine the underlying causes of a child's behavior. In instances where neglect or lack of guidance from parents is evident, addressing parental accountability may be beneficial. However, for cases where environmental or psychological factors play a dominant role, the focus should shift towards rehabilitation and psychological support for the child, ensuring their integration into society.

In conclusion, whether to punish the child or the parents for juvenile crimes is a multifaceted issue requiring a tailored approach. Both children and parents must assume responsibility, reinforcing the importance of accountability and support systems. By doing so, society can work towards reducing juvenile crime rates, fostering a generation of responsible and conscientious individuals.",8.0
The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent days, the Government set new rules to avoid road accidents. Some people believe stricter punishments for driver offences are the only way to improve road safety. I completely disagree with this statement. stricter punishment may reduce road accidents but it's not the only way. In this essay, I will discuss how other effective ways like good infrastructure, regular vehicle maintenance and awareness  improve road safety.

Firstly, Good roads might  avoid road accidents. If the government provides infrastructure like good roads, traffic lights, and speed breakers in right place, there is a high chance to avoid road accidents. For instance, UK authority well maintains their roads which reduce 20% of road accidents  every year. Likewise, regular vehicle maintenance helps to avoid road accidents. a person who drives a vehicle in the bad condition  face difficulties during driving which may lead to  severe accidents. The government set regulations to check the vehicle condition  every year might avoid this kind of accidents. For example, In India authorities should check the vehicle condition every year and provide an FC certificate, a person who drives a vehicle without an FC certificate should be punished.

Furthermore, the Administration set an awareness campaign about  road accident for  people may give more responsibility to  societies. communities had a lack of awareness about  road safety.Government should advertise the importance of wearing helmets as well as a seat belts to the people. For example, In 2016, Bajaj company set a campaign and they told how many  bikers are dead on highways because of not following the road rules.

In conclusion, punishment for the driving offence is one of the way to improve road safety but it's not the only way. Authorities also take responsibility to improve road safety.",5,6.0,"To help you reach your desired IELTS band score of 8.0, let's refine your essay step-by-step, incorporating detailed feedback that aligns with the IELTS criteria:

While many advocate for stricter penalties for driving offences as a solution to improve safety, I firmly believe that this approach alone is insufficient. Although stricter punishments may have some impact, a multifaceted approach that includes improved infrastructure, regular vehicle maintenance, and public awareness campaigns is essential for substantial and long-lasting improvements in road safety.

To begin with, enhancing road infrastructure is vital in reducing traffic collisions. Well-designed roads equipped with appropriate traffic signals, clear signage, and strategically placed speed breakers can significantly decrease the likelihood of accidents. A report from the World Health Organization has noted that countries investing in road infrastructure have witnessed a measurable reduction in accident rates. For instance, the establishment of safer pedestrian crossings and better-lit streets in Scandinavian countries has resulted in a noticeable decline in road mishaps. Consequently, prioritizing infrastructural development should be paramount in ensuring safer roads.

Moreover, regular vehicle maintenance plays a crucial role in improving road safety. The maintenance ensures that vehicles are in optimal condition, thereby reducing the chances of mechanical failures that could lead to accidents. Governments can enforce regulations requiring annual vehicle inspections to ascertain their roadworthiness. As observed in Germany, compulsory annual inspections have been an effective measure, contributing to their reputation as having one of the safest road networks globally. Enforcing such practices worldwide would undeniably lead to safer driving conditions.

Furthermore, raising public awareness about road safety measures is indispensable. Public education campaigns focusing on the critical importance of adhering to traffic rules and the benefits of protective gear, such as helmets and seatbelts, can instil a culture of responsibility among drivers and pedestrians alike. In India, for example, campaigns conducted by both governmental bodies and private sectors have successfully raised awareness, significantly influencing safer driving practices. This shared responsibility among society and authorities can lead to a considerable decrease in road accidents.

In conclusion, while stricter punishments for driving offences may deter reckless behaviour to some extent, they are not the sole answer to improving road safety. A holistic approach that integrates improved infrastructure, mandatory vehicle maintenance, and widespread educational initiatives is imperative to achieving safer road environments. Addressing road safety requires a collective effort where the government and community play pivotal roles in ensuring all measures are implemented effectively and uniformly.",8.0

While some argue that it plays an integral role in fostering young minds, others view it as a dispensable subject, diverting attention from core academic responsibilities. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my opinion that art is indeed a crucial component of children's education.

Proponents of art as an essential subject assert that it offers invaluable means for self-expression and emotional exploration. Through various forms such as drawing, painting, and sculpting, students can articulate feelings that they might struggle to express with words alone. For instance, a child who might be reticent in verbal communication could very well showcase intricate thoughts and emotions through art, thus finding a voice they never knew they had. Moreover, art stimulates creativity and imagination, skills that are indispensable in a rapidly evolving job market that increasingly values innovation. Furthermore, art education can enhance cognitive abilities, supporting critical thinking and problem-solving skills. For example, analyzing a complex piece of artwork builds observational acuity and encourages deductive reasoning.

Conversely, skeptics argue that art takes valuable time away from more academically rigorous subjects that are essential for future career success. With mounting educational demands, especially in subjects like mathematics, science, and technology, there is fear that devoting time to art could lead to insufficient preparation in these critical areas. Students might face pressure to excel in standardized testing, where art is not directly assessed, leading to an undervaluation of art's worth in a competitive academic environment. Therefore, there is a belief that the curriculum should prioritize subjects that directly contribute to academic achievements and practical career skills.

Despite these concerns, I advocate for the integration of art into school curricula as fundamental to a well-rounded education. The interdisciplinary benefits of art are profound—beyond fostering creativity and critical thinking, it cultivates cultural awareness and empathy by exposing students to diverse historical and multicultural narratives embedded in artworks. Programs that integrate art with subjects like history or science have shown to enhance learner engagement and comprehension, providing varied contexts through which academic content is absorbed and retained.

In conclusion, while concerns about prioritizing time and resources in education are valid, the benefits of incorporating art in schooling far outweigh the drawbacks. Not only does art promote essential cognitive and emotional development, but it also enriches students' understanding of the world and their place within it. Consequently, educational institutions should embrace art as a permanent and pivotal element of school curricula, enabling children to thrive both personally and academically.",8.0

Keep up the hard work!","In the current era of rapid technological advancement, the role of robotics in shaping the future of society is being hotly debated. While some view robots as indispensable for human development, others are wary of their potential drawbacks and the impact they may have on society. This essay will explore both perspectives and articulate my own viewpoint.

On the one hand, proponents of robots emphasize their significant contributions to human progress. Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new horizons for exploration that were once deemed inaccessible. For instance, Mars rover missions like Curiosity have provided invaluable data about the Martian atmosphere and geology, an achievement made possible primarily due to robotic technology. Furthermore, robots equipped with AI are already transforming various sectors, such as healthcare, where they assist in surgeries and rehabilitation, thereby enhancing efficiency and precision. In this context, it is clear that robots can be instrumental in pushing the boundaries of what humanity can achieve.

Conversely, there are legitimate concerns about the social implications of widespread robotics use. A major issue is the displacement of human workers by automated systems. Industries like manufacturing, food processing, and logistics have increasingly adopted robots due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to human labor. This shift towards automation threatens to exacerbate unemployment and widen socio-economic disparities. Additionally, the increased reliance on robots raises questions about privacy and security, as AI systems process vast amounts of personal data. It is crucial to address these challenges to ensure that technological advancements do not come at the expense of societal well-being.

In my opinion, robots are indeed vital for future human development, provided their integration into society is managed responsibly.

This essay will explore the diverse motivations behind this trend and the techniques individuals can employ to investigate the historical backgrounds of their residences.

Firstly, the rising intrigue in the history of a dwelling can be attributed to a blend of curiosity, cultural preservation, and personal connection. Many people find themselves fascinated by the hidden stories enclosed within the walls of their homes. Whether it involves uncovering tales of previous dignitaries residing in the same quarters or discovering significant historic events linked to their residence, understanding a building's past adds a layer of depth and meaning to one's home. Moreover, recognizing and appreciating cultural heritage through the historic significance of structures fosters a sense of pride and identity among residents, encouraging them to maintain and preserve these communal treasures.

Additionally, the historical value associated with a building can influence its market value. Houses with rich backstories, such as those that may have been inhabited by notable figures, often attract potential buyers who place a premium on acquiring not just a shelter but a piece of history itself. Preserving the legacy embedded within these structures can thus work as an investment in the cultural and economic realms.

When it comes to delving into the past of buildings, various methods can prove effective. Engaging with local historical societies or archives can provide a wealth of information about the architectural lineage and anecdotal accounts related to a structure. These avenues offer official records and documents such as deeds, maps, and previous ownership logs. Furthermore, speaking with longtime residents or elders in the community can provide oral histories, imparting personal anecdotes and communal memories that aren't formally documented yet hold immense value.

Libraries and public records offices remain invaluable resources for those seeking to conduct thorough research. They often house public registries, photographs, and documentation that detail a region's development over time. In the digital age, numerous online databases and social media groups dedicated to local history further facilitate the exploration process, allowing individuals to connect with experts and historians who might offer insights or leads on where to look next.

In conclusion, the quest to uncover the history of one's home or building is driven by a mix of personal curiosity, cultural preservation, and economic interest. By employing varied research methods, individuals can assemble a comprehensive picture of their dwelling's past, enriching their living experience and forging a deeper connection with their environment. As more residents embark on this journey of discovery, they contribute to a broader understanding and appreciation of the shared history within their communities.",8.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, factors such as human activities, geomagnetic fluctuation lead to global warming and other disaster weathers, the advocation of finding a way to live with these climate change other than preventing them have become controversial. realistically, I disagree with this opinion, prevention should be considered as the priority. 

To begin with, climate changes could produce negative influences on the world. Disastrous weather such as hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, In 2004, the Tsunami in Indonesia took away millions of lives, thousands of families have lost their members and homes, and it caused a long-lasting severe economic loss not only in East Asia but also to the world.  Although the affected area has received emergency aids from domestic and international societies, the reconstruction works are still enormous and it may take decades to recover. Other examples such as melting ice sheets in the north pole which is caused by global warming,  would lead to the rise in ocean level and there is really not much that humans could do to change it. Furthermore, Coastal areas would be flooded and many species would lose theirs inhabits.  In order to tackle this problem  which is technically impossible to be solved and governments would have to spend an unimaginable amount of money 

The fact has proven it is hard to survive and live with the consequence when climate change comes; therefore, every possible action must be taken to protect our environment and to prevent any disasters from happening. On the one hand, individuals would make a contribution by using reusable bags and going to work by walking or public transportation to reduce contamination to the environment.  On the other hand, governments and international organizations should promote eco-friendly resources in civilian use to help reduce emissions of fossil fuel. As a consequence, the world would develop in a more sustainable way and save more money in dealing with adapting to climate changes. 

To sum up, I think prevention is always better than cure. we all should take actions to help to reduce pollutions.",8,6.5,"**Feedback for Improvement**

While some people argue that humanity should focus on adapting to climatic shifts, I firmly disagree. It is imperative that we prioritize the prevention of further climate change as a global agenda.

To begin with, the adverse effects of climate change are already evident and threaten both human life and natural ecosystems. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and unprecedented heatwaves have become more frequent, causing significant loss of lives, destruction of property, and economic disruption. For instance, the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia demonstrated the devastating impact of such natural disasters, resulting in tragic loss of life and long-term economic suffering. The reconstruction of affected areas still lags behind after years of relentless effort, indicating the scope of the damage caused by such events.

In addition to immediate catastrophes, climate change also leads to longer-term geographical and ecological challenges. A case in point is the alarming rate at which polar ice caps are melting, leading to rising sea levels. Coastal cities face severe threats of inundation, which would displace communities and disrupt economies globally. In addition, many species are facing the danger of extinction as their habitats change or disappear altogether, resulting in an irreparable loss to biodiversity.

On the other hand, those in favor of adaptation often argue that humanity's ingenuity can develop technologies and systems to withstand the changing climate. However, this view underestimates the far-reaching and often irreversible consequences of climate change. While some adaptation is necessary, solely relying on it can be a short-sighted approach. Technological advancements take time to develop, and not all regions have equal access to these innovations. By focusing on prevention, we address not only the symptoms but also the root cause of the problem.

Furthermore, prevention through concerted efforts holds tangible benefits. Individuals can contribute by employing environmentally friendly practices such as using sustainable materials, reducing waste, and minimizing fossil fuel use. Governments and organizations can implement widespread policies that encourage green energy solutions and reduce emission levels. Successful prevention strategies will not only slow the progression of climate change but also enhance the planet's resilience against unforeseen ecological crises.

In conclusion, while adaptation to climate change may seem like a viable option, it fails to consider the profound impact and urgency of the issue. Preventive measures are crucial and should be prioritized to safeguard the environment, protect biodiversity and secure future generations. Collective action by individuals, nations, and the global community forms a robust path towards mitigating climate change effectively. The focus should remain on prevention, and cultivating a sustainable world is an imperative goal for all.",8.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people hold the view that adolescents should go to community work in their free time without salary, because this can help both young people and the community. In my point of view, I totally agree with this opinion.

           First, do the community work in your free time helps teenagers a lot. When participating in community activities such as volunteering, helping disadvantaged people, they will experience more and learn valuable life skills. A teenager who joins in a lots of unpaid community work will have more life skills than the one who does not do anything. Because through the work, he can learn many new things from people. Not only that, through his work experience, he will also have valuable materials for future employment.

         On the other hand, when young people do unpaid community work our country's quality of life will improve. If society is contributed by the effort of youth, our life will develop day by day. Because,when working, teenagers will have more love for the country and society and from there they will always try to dedicate for the growing country. The society where teenagers who are always be ready to contribute will develop more than the one where teenagers are usually lazy to work. The USA is a very developed country with the largest civilization in the world, and American teenagers are always ready to participate in a lot of community activities.

Some proponents argue that teenagers should engage in such activities during their free time, believing that both the adolescents and the broader society stand to gain significantly from such endeavors. I am inclined to agree with this perspective, as the benefits of unpaid community service for teenagers are manifold, offering them valuable life lessons while simultaneously fostering societal development.

To begin with, when young people engage in community service without expecting monetary compensation, they cultivate a range of important life skills and experiences. Participation in altruistic endeavors allows teenagers to gain a deeper understanding of empathy, teamwork, and adaptability. For instance, when teenagers volunteer at food banks or shelters, they directly assist underprivileged individuals, broaden their perspectives, and develop a sense of compassion and social responsibility. These experiences not only build character but also augment their employability by equipping them with crucial skills that are highly valued in the job market.

Furthermore, the voluntary contributions of teenagers greatly enhance the community's quality of life. By collaborating in community projects, such as environmental clean-ups or local fundraising events, adolescents contribute substantially to societal progress. Such experiences often instill a sense of allegiance towards their community and nurture a civic-minded attitude. For example, many voluntary programs in the United States actively engage teenagers, helping to shape them into responsible citizens who are ready to take initiative in future roles. While their efforts might seem small in isolation, collectively, they drive immense community benefit and foster an ethos of shared community prosperity.

However, some may argue that mandating unpaid work could potentially impede on teenagers' personal time or academic responsibilities. Nonetheless, it is crucial to find a balance that allows young individuals to manage their commitments effectively while partaking in community service. The structured frameworks within schools or local civic programs can provide the necessary guidance and support to ensure this balance is maintained.

In summary, engaging in community service without compensation provides teenagers not only with an array of personal advantages, such as skill development and increased employability, but also helps to enrich the communities in which they live. While it should never encroach upon their essential time for rest and studies, these activities are a transformative way for adolescents to acquire invaluable experience that will serve them well into adulthood. Therefore, I hold firm that the benefits of teenagers partaking in unpaid community work profoundly outweigh any potential drawbacks, benefiting both the young individuals and the society at large.",8.0
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no dought that people stay employed due to many factors, and money has been considered the most essential reason to remain in the same job. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement and I am going to elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.

First and foremost, job satisfaction is considered to be a major contributor to office's enthusiasm, due to the fact that doing what you love makes your activities or test easier and more interesting. In other words, it gives you the feeling of pleasure, which can help you get rid of stress got in the workplace. Take my mother as an example, she is an elementary school teacher and has been teaching English for over 30 years. Although she only earned a little money, she took delight in it. Because she really likes to teach children and was also highly respected by her students. As a consequence, satisfaction plays a significant role in putting more effort into performance.

Furthermore, the atmosphere at work is also one of the crucial causes to be in the workplace. Working with friendly colleagues and a well boss can boost employees' confidence and happiness  because it creates a comfortable working environment without coworker pressure. For example, despite my workplace being extremely far from my home, my colleagues are so kind that I decided to stay and work with them.

While financial remuneration is undeniably a significant factor, it is not the sole determinant. In this essay, I will argue that job satisfaction and a supportive work environment often outweigh monetary incentives as primary motivators for individuals to stay in the workforce. 

To begin with, job satisfaction is a pivotal factor that fuels employees' desire to continue in their positions. When individuals engage in work that aligns with their personal interests and passion, they experience a sense of fulfillment that money alone cannot provide. This intrinsic motivation can lead to enhanced productivity and reduced stress levels. A compelling example is that of a dedicated teacher who may receive a modest salary yet derives immense pleasure and gratification from positively influencing young minds. This profound satisfaction often supersedes financial benefits and ensures their steadfast commitment to the profession.

Moreover, the atmosphere within a workplace is equally crucial. A collaborative and supportive work environment can substantially boost an employee's morale and job commitment. Friendly colleagues and an approachable management team create a cohesive atmosphere that encourages innovation and cooperation. For instance, individuals are often willing to overlook logistical inconveniences, such as a lengthy daily commute if they are enveloped in a supportive, team-oriented atmosphere at work. This environment not only enhances job satisfaction but also cultivates a strong sense of belonging and loyalty.

While it is undeniable that financial incentives are influential, it is imperative to acknowledge the importance of other factors such as career development opportunities, recognition, and personal growth, which can be powerful motivators. Employees often seek positions where they can advance their skills and evolve professionally, which ultimately contributes to their overall satisfaction and willingness to remain in the workforce.

In conclusion, although financial remuneration plays a role in motivating employees, it is not the predominant factor that keeps individuals in their jobs. Job satisfaction, a positive work environment, and opportunities for personal and career growth are equally, if not more, significant in fostering long-term employment commitment. Balancing these factors is essential for both employees and employers striving for a productive and harmonious workplace.",8.0
"some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Nowadays, the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation. Some individuals believe that the price of fuel should be increased to tackle this problem. Although I agree with this opinion, I think that the increasing rate of fuel cost would also have negative effects on society.

On the one hand, raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial. According to this, many people would avoid driving their own cars since they will not be able to afford the high cost of fuel. Besides, they will be motivated to take more public transportation instead of their private cars, resulting in decreasing the heavy traffics. Therefore, the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems. For instance, many people have died annually as a result of lung cancer and respiratory diseases that are caused by air pollution.

on the other hand, increasing the fuel cost would have many drawbacks. Firstly, the public transportation cost will be escalated due to the expensive fuel. Secondly, the transportation expenses for businesses would also be raised. In such cases, companies will be forced to increase the prices of their products to compensate for these high expenses. Thus, people would be burdened with higher living costs. If the government can control these increasing rates of transportation and goods, the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged.

In conclusion, while increasing the fuel cost could place many people under the pressure of difficult economic situations, I agree that it is vital for solving environmental problems.",6,6.5,"**Task Response:**

Your essay effectively addresses the question by discussing the pros and cons of increasing fuel prices. To further your argument, consider presenting additional solutions to complement the strategy of raising fuel costs. You might explore the role of renewable energy adoption, stricter emissions regulations, or governmental subsidies for green technologies. Including ideas about mitigating the negative effects of rising fuel costs, such as offering subsidies for public transport or incentivizing electric vehicle use, would show a more sophisticated engagement with the topic.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay is coherent and follows a logical structure with clear divisions between sections. To enhance cohesion, ensure the smooth flow of ideas by incorporating transitional phrases such as ""furthermore,"" ""consequently,"" and ""on the contrary."" Starting each paragraph with a clear topic sentence will help improve clarity and guide the reader through your argument seamlessly. Take care to maintain consistency in paragraph structure and ensure each argument builds logically on the previous one.

**Lexical Resource:**

Your vocabulary is adequate but could benefit from greater variety and complexity. To boost your score, aim to integrate more nuanced language and synonyms. For instance, instead of ""negative effects,"" consider using ""adverse consequences"" or instead of ""tackle this problem,"" try ""address this critical issue."" Incorporating idiomatic expressions or less common collocations will demonstrate an advanced lexical resource.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The grammatical structures are generally sound, but they tend to be simple and repetitive. Enhance your essay by using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences. Employing complex structures, such as relative clauses (""those who are unable to afford fuel might turn to alternatives"") and conditional forms (""if fuel prices rise significantly, many might reconsider their transport options""), will add depth to your writing. Pay attention to minor grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and capitalization, as these can impact your score.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Broaden the Argument**: Suggest alternative solutions and mitigation strategies for increased fuel costs to present a well-rounded view.
   
2. **Strengthen Cohesion**: Use transitional phrases and topic sentences to better connect ideas across the essay.

3. **Expand Lexical Resource**: Integrate advanced vocabulary and expressions to articulate your points more effectively.

4. **Variety in Grammar**: Introduce a wider range of sentence structures to demonstrate advanced grammatical proficiency.

**Overall Summary:**

Your essay presents a solid foundation in addressing the task but requires enhanced exploration of both supporting and alternative perspectives. Improved coherence and linkage between ideas, a richer lexical resource, and varied grammatical structures will elevate the overall quality of the essay, helping you achieve your desired IELTS band score. With focused revisions, you can bridge the gap to the target score of 8.0.","Addressing global environmental challenges is of paramount importance in today's society. One proposed solution is to increase the cost of fuel with the aim of curbing its consumption and the subsequent negative impact on the environment. While I partially agree with this measure, I believe that a multifaceted approach is required to effectively tackle these critical issues, including bolstering renewable energy sources and implementing stricter emissions regulations.

On the one hand, increasing fuel prices can lead to a notable decline in fuel usage. As a result, individuals may opt for public transportation or carpooling, thus reducing the number of vehicles on the road. This decline in private vehicle usage would not only ease traffic congestion but would also result in lower emissions of greenhouse gases, thus contributing to improved air quality. Moreover, such a measure could serve as a catalyst for behavioural change, encouraging the adoption of more sustainable practices, such as cycling or using electric vehicles. Nevertheless, higher fuel costs could impose significant economic burdens on individuals and businesses, who might struggle to adapt quickly to these changes.

On the other hand, the disadvantages of raising fuel costs must be carefully mitigated to prevent adverse consequences. The increase in transportation expenses affects both the public and the economic sector, leading to a rise in the cost of goods and services. To counter this, governments could introduce measures such as subsidies for those who utilize public transport or incentives to encourage the purchase of electric cars. Alongside these adjustments, adopting alternative solutions like more stringent emissions standards would ensure a systematic reduction of pollution from industrial and automotive sources.

Ultimately, solving global environmental problems necessitates a balanced strategy, integrating the raising of fuel costs with the advancement of renewable energy technology. Governments could drive these initiatives by investing in research and development for green technologies, offering incentives for solar or wind energy, and establishing robust legislative frameworks for environmental protection. These approaches, combined with public education campaigns to raise awareness about sustainable living, offer a more comprehensive solution to the environmental issues we face.

In conclusion, while the increase in fuel costs can play a role in reducing environmental degradation, it should be part of a broader strategy addressing both economic and ecological aspects. By innovating and investing in alternative solutions, societies can work towards a greener future without compromising on economic growth.",8.0
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantage of technology outweigh the disadvantages,"It is believed by some experts that social media is a good source of entertainment and also helps us to make incredible contacts with each other. I agree with this aforementioned notion because it helps us to know about the world and it makes our work easier as compared to the past. Although, it has some demerits too.

On the one hand side, technical gadgets play an indispensable role in the modern era. Furthermore, nowadays, it makes our work and lifestyle easier. For example, by social media, people can get information in every nook and corner of the world without wastage of time

like nowadays, pupils can chat with each other by using many social apps like  WhatsApp for chatting, tweeter for spreading out the news, and so on. In the past, people did not have this type of water to talk and they were not aware of how to use it. Additionally, in today's world, people become more realistic and have a piece of great knowledge about gadgets so, it is becoming their jobs easier and fast. All in all, we can say the merits are more of this outweigh the demerits.

On the other hand, it has some drawbacks also because sometimes it can create difficulties. Moreover, by using popular social apps, people can create violence. For instance, youngsters use more and more chatting apps, and many times they spread out the fake news in all their knowns and it spread so fast in less time and can halt the society.

While some argue that the demerits of social media overshadow its merits, I firmly believe that the advantages substantially outweigh the disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss how social media facilitates global communication and provides essential information while acknowledging the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the global connectivity afforded by social media is unparalleled. These platforms have obliterated geographical barriers, enabling individuals to interact seamlessly with others regardless of their location. Social media applications such as WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook facilitate instant communication, allowing people to form and maintain relationships more effectively than in the past. For instance, during recent global events, individuals could stay in touch with their loved ones despite being separated by distance, providing emotional and social support.

Moreover, social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news and information promptly. It serves as a real-time information hub where users worldwide can share and receive updates within seconds. This instantaneous flow of information significantly enhances public awareness and engagement in societal issues. For example, events such as natural disasters can be reported and responded to more effectively due to the swift spread of information on social networks.

Admittedly, there are potential negative aspects associated with social media usage. Concerns have been raised regarding the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can lead to social unrest and distrust. However, the onus is on users and platforms to develop critical thinking skills and implement stricter guidelines to mitigate these risks. While these challenges are significant, they do not negate the overwhelmingly positive impact that social media has on communication and information dissemination.

In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of social media, its ability to connect individuals globally and provide instant access to information far surpasses these concerns. By responsibly managing its use and implementing appropriate safeguards, the advantages of social media can continue to enrich our society without undermining its integrity.",8.0
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Space explorations have been developed since  the post- modern era and it has made a huge transformationin  the various sectors of the life; however, there remain some disagreements as to whether this  crucial for the country or the funds can be channelized to more pressing issues. I, personally, consider that it is extremely significant for countries to invest in outer space studies to progress further.
 First of all, it is an indisputable fact that, many  communication facilities and treatment modalities are originally developed for the space research.  CT scan, for instance, which was used to analysis the picture of  the moon and then, scientist realiased that it can be used in the medical field to study the internal organs. Apart from this, communication sector is the another area which is also benefited tremendously by these researches. By lounching satellites to the space, this had revelutionised the way humen communicate and the information technology. Currently, people can have conversations( face to face and voice) with either relatives or friends on the other side of the world by using mobiles or with the internet.
 However, there some people argue that, the amount which has spent can be invested to improve the public infrastructure: hospitals, educational institutions, and transportation facilities. These are the basic requirements need to be provided to the citizens of any country, instead of funding to the  exploration of space. Developing countries, India and China, where a large proportion people lives under poverty, despite this fact, they  allocate a  major portion of income to these research. By contrast, if these nations helped needy people with sufficient amount, they would contribute back to the country.
By way of conclusion, even though people are differed regarding spending money to conduct space research, I , again reaffirm that it is better, if they could use this for nation building and providing minimum facilitities to the society.",5,4.0,"Thank you for sharing your essay.

I fully agree with this idea and believe that engaging teenagers in community service can foster significant benefits for their personal development and the community.

First and foremost, participating in unpaid community service allows teenagers to develop essential skills that are beneficial for their future. Through volunteering, they can learn valuable lessons in responsibility, time management, and teamwork. These experiences often help teenagers develop a strong work ethic and prepare them for future professional environments. For example, a teenager helping at a local community center may learn to organize activities and communicate effectively with people of all ages, skills that are crucial in any career field.

Furthermore, community service instills a sense of civic engagement and social responsibility in teenagers. By volunteering their time, teenagers become more aware of the needs of their community and gain a greater appreciation for the challenges others face. This type of involvement helps nurture empathy and compassion in young individuals, encouraging them to contribute positively to society throughout their lives. For instance, teenagers who volunteer at nursing homes or food banks often develop a deep sense of empathy and a desire to address social inequalities.

Moreover, the community stands to gain significantly from the active involvement of teenagers. With their energy and fresh perspectives, young volunteers can drive positive change and support community initiatives effectively. For instance, volunteering programs in parks or community clean-ups often rely heavily on the physical capabilities and enthusiasm of young people. In turn, communities become cleaner, safer, and more vibrant, creating a better environment for everyone.

However, we must also acknowledge some challenges associated with mandating unpaid work for teenagers. Balancing school responsibilities, extracurricular activities, and social lives can already be demanding for some teenagers. Hence, compulsory volunteering must be managed in a way that it does not overwhelm them. Nevertheless, these challenges can be mitigated by offering flexible volunteering schedules and integrating community service into school curricula, thus balancing their academic and personal lives.

In conclusion, while challenges exist in mandating unpaid work, the potential benefits to both teenagers and society make it a worthy pursuit. Volunteering not only aids personal development by imparting crucial skills and values but also fortifies community well-being through active youth participation. Encouraging teenagers to engage in community service initiatives can cultivate socially responsible citizens, ultimately fostering a more cohesive and compassionate society.",8.0
"Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women.
What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation?","Men have dominated job sector since the industrial revolution, despite progress in gender equality. Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in the tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. 

Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their marital and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a college degree or a computer science graduation tends to lower their confidence at work place or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instance, in Asian countries people believe that men are the bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education, but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.

Many women activists across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As a result of this, today, many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their workforce have equal number of women and men employed. Other than this IT sector need to diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.

This disparity raises questions regarding the systemic barriers that women encounter as they pursue careers in technology and the necessary strategies to combat these challenges. In this essay, I will examine the fundamental problems these women face, including societal biases, family expectations, and a lack of visible role models, while also suggesting comprehensive measures to promote gender equality in this vital industry.

Foremost among the challenges faced by women in the tech industry is the presence of ingrained societal biases. Women, regardless of their qualifications, often encounter discriminatory recruitment practices. Interviewers frequently probe into applicants’ personal circumstances, such as marital status and family plans, which can unjustly influence hiring decisions. Furthermore, many cultures continue to uphold traditional perceptions of gender roles, encouraging men to seek higher education and employment, while simultaneously steering women towards domestic duties. This imbalance fosters a detrimental self-perception that decreases women's confidence when applying for tech-related jobs, inhibiting their career progression.

Crucially, the lack of female role models and mentors compounds this issue. The tech industry, saturated with male representation, offers few examples of successful women that aspiring female professionals can emulate. This void perpetuates the myth that technology is an inherently male domain and dissuades women from pursuing or excelling in tech careers. For instance, in countries across Asia, patriarchal views frame men as the family's primary financial providers, encouraging their investment in education and career development while sidelining women's aspirations.

In tackling these barriers, a multifaceted approach is essential. Corporations must commit to implementing gender-neutral recruitment practices, ensuring that evaluation criteria focus solely on skills and competencies rather than personal circumstances. Furthermore, education systems need to play a transformative role by promoting equal access to STEM subjects for all genders from an early age. Incorporating gender studies and mentorship programs would inspire young girls to envision themselves in tech roles, cultivating an inclusive mindset.

Moreover, the establishment of strong networks and communities for women in tech can offer invaluable support, providing access to mentors, resources, and opportunities for career advancement. Governments can facilitate these initiatives by collaborating with industry leaders to sponsor scholarships and training programs specifically targeted at women. Creating incentives for companies to maintain a balanced workforce would also support long-term change.

In conclusion, overcoming the gender disparity in tech requires a concerted effort to dismantle societal biases and provide equal opportunities, resources, and representation. By fostering an inclusive culture within the industry and educational systems, empowering women through mentorship, and reforming corporate and governmental policies, we can create an environment where women feel motivated and supported in achieving their professional ambitions. This paradigm shift is not only essential for achieving gender equality but also for unlocking the full potential of the tech industry through diverse perspectives and innovations.",8.0
Some people believe that scientists have more influence over the world whereas others argue that politician have more influence over the world. Discuss both the views and give your opinion?,"It is often believed that the planet is more impacted by the people who have expert knowledge in physical or natural science, while others argue that it is generally influenced by persons, who are especially involved in politics. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the former view.  

On the one hand, those who believe legislative can have a significant impact over the globe is likely to be limited. Although the prominent law-making decisions and international treaties between neighbour countries could be build-up by the specific politicians,  it would be helped to their citizens of the particular country. To illustrate this, the economic policies of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh has brought up INDIA way  in the eyes of the whole world, but the most might be benefitted by this are their permanent residences. Therefore, their impact applies to among people of the country merely.

On the other hand, I would argue that scientists can be hugely impacted in many countries as compared to politicians. This reason behind this is that their advancement in technology and medical science may provide assistance to a large number of people, which are also included public servants, who tend to use their unique inventions and upgrade to the country equipment such as fighter jets and satellites. For instance, the Internet and the Mobile phones are the best ever inventions made by Vinton Cerf and Martin Cooper which are used by people of every corner of the earth. It can be reached to a million people and this may result become more influential.

On the one hand, we have scientists whose groundbreaking discoveries and innovations have reshaped our lives and continue to propel the world into the future. On the other, politicians wield power that can direct societal change through governance, policy-making, and international diplomacy. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and discuss why I believe that scientists have a slight edge in terms of global influence.

Firstly, it is undeniable that scientists have profoundly impacted the globe through technological and medical advancements. Their contributions have transformed the way we communicate, work, and live. For example, the invention of the Internet by Vinton Cerf has revolutionized global communication, enabling the flow of information in ways that were previously unimaginable. Similarly, breakthroughs in medicine, such as the development of vaccines, have saved millions of lives across continents, showing science's universal impact. These innovations often transcend national borders, benefiting humanity as a whole and contributing to an interconnected global community.

Moreover, scientific research addresses critical global challenges, such as climate change and energy sustainability. The influence of scientists in these areas is indispensable as their solutions often guide political decisions and international agreements. For instance, the Paris Agreement on climate change heavily relied upon scientific findings to set targets for reducing carbon emissions globally. Thus, scientists not only influence through their inventions but also provide the foundation upon which important political decisions are made.

Conversely, politicians also hold significant sway, primarily through enacting laws and policies that shape societal structures. Prominent political figures can inspire movements and enact radical social changes, as seen in historical contexts like the civil rights movement in the United States. Their roles in diplomacy and conflict resolution are crucial as they can establish peace or lead nations into war. Nevertheless, their influence is often limited to their respective countries and terms of office. While politicians can execute considerable change, it typically requires sustained effort over time and can be influenced by internal politics and public opinion.

In conclusion, while politicians undoubtedly have the ability to enact significant change within societies through policy-making and governance, I maintain that scientists exert a more enduring and widespread influence on the global stage. Scientific advancements have the ability to transcend geographical barriers and continue to play a central role in addressing global issues. The synergy between science and politics is essential; however, the pioneering efforts of scientists often set the agenda that politicians work to implement. Hence, in the broader context of global impact, scientists hold the key to shaping a sustainable and advanced future for all of humanity.",8.0

A deeper understanding into the causative factors and potential solutions is crucial to address this issue effectively. This essay will examine the multifaceted causes leading to high traffic volumes and propose a variety of strategies that can be adopted to mitigate the problem.

One primary cause of traffic congestion is the rapid urbanization process. As more people move to cities in search of better employment opportunities, the demand for personal vehicles escalates, resulting in increased pressure on existing road infrastructure. Besides, the affordable credit options available to consumers make it easier for people to purchase cars, contributing to the glut of vehicles. Furthermore, cultural preferences that regard car ownership as a status symbol exacerbate the problem. This is especially evident in households owning multiple vehicles due to the perceived convenience and prestige associated with personal transport.

In response to these causes, several actions can be taken to alleviate traffic congestion. First and foremost, investing in the enhancement of public transportation infrastructures, such as more frequent and reliable bus and train services, can offer a viable alternative to private car use. Not only does this reduce the number of cars on the road, but it also provides an affordable and eco-friendly travel option. Additionally, implementing policies that promote carpooling through the establishment of car-sharing platforms could significantly curb the number of vehicles on the streets. Fiscal measures like increased fuel levies and congestion charges in heavily trafficked areas could also discourage excessive reliance on personal vehicles, driving individuals to seek alternative transport modes.

Policy-makers should also focus on the integration of urban planning with technological solutions such as smart traffic management systems. These solutions can enhance road usage efficiency and reduce traffic delays. By addressing these underlying facets, we can move toward managing urban centers more effectively.

In conclusion, the soaring traffic volumes in cities are a consequence of rapid urbanization, easy car credit options, and cultural inclinations towards automobile ownership. To solve this growing problem, a multifaceted approach that includes improving public transportation, promoting carpooling, and implementing intelligent traffic solutions is required. By implementing these strategies, we can strive for more sustainable and efficiently-run urban environments.",8.0
Children find it difficult to pay attention or concentrate on school study what are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, children face difficulties concentrating in school classes and their studies. There are a number of reasons why they don’t focus on studying. That, I will explain and give a solution to the problem.

There are many causes why pupils don’t pay attention to school studies. The first reason is the syllabus of the semester. To illustrate, mostly secondary or high secondary academy have more than five subjects which students find hard to memorise . The second reason is the way teachers teach them. Many offspring cannot understand what tutors teach them and find their way of teaching boring. Lastly, there are fewer enjoyable activities in academy. For example, most faculty don’t have subjects like art and drawing. That is why children cannot focus on study.

To solve this problem parents and institutes need to come forward and take some steps. For instance, department need to arrange a parent meeting every month and parents also pay close attention to their children. Moreover, university can add some new subjects such as arts and crafts so children can relax in class. For example, if department add art classes so students enjoy them and it also refreshes their minds. These are the solutions to the issue.

The myriad of reasons contributing to this problem are complex and varied, but generally revolve around the school environment, personal habits, and external distractions. Understanding these factors and implementing effective solutions is essential for enhancing students' focus and academic success.

One significant factor responsible for students' reduced attention spans is the sheer volume and nature of the school curriculum. Often, the academic content is presented in an overwhelming manner due to excessive syllabus demands, which can lead to cognitive overload and fatigue. When students face an extensive range of subjects, particularly in high school, the necessity to memorise a vast amount of information can become burdensome, and their engagement begins to wane. Besides academic load, teaching methods play a crucial role in maintaining student attention. Traditional didactic teaching approaches that rely heavily on lectures can seem monotonous to students, lowering their attention levels. Conversely, interactive teaching methods that actively involve students can significantly enhance their focus and motivation to learn.

Another core issue affecting concentration is the prevalence of technology and social media distractions. In today's digital age, children are easily lured by gadgets, which have become ubiquitous both inside and outside the classroom. These devices, though valuable for learning, often serve as channels for distractions during study time, as students can access games and social media platforms instead of focusing on their academic work.

To address this multifaceted issue, both schools and parents need to play proactive roles. School administrations should focus on revising curricula to ensure they are manageable and align with students' cognitive capacities. Including more creative subjects such as arts, music, and physical education can provide a balanced approach, offering students an outlet for expression and relaxation. Furthermore, educators should be encouraged to adopt dynamic and interactive teaching techniques that stimulate engagement, such as the use of technology in educationally constructive ways or incorporating group exercises and discussions into lessons.

Parents, on the other hand, need to ensure a supportive home environment that provides limited distractions during study times. It is vital to establish routines that involve specific periods free from electronic devices, allowing the child to focus solely on their studies. Furthermore, teaching children time management skills and the importance of prioritising tasks can greatly enhance their ability to concentrate and handle academic pressures.

In conclusion, while children’s difficulty in concentrating on studies stems from a variety of factors, solutions do exist if both schools and parents work collaboratively. By adjusting curricula, encouraging engaging teaching methods, and managing technology use, we can create an environment conducive to concentration and learning. These changes are crucial for fostering a generation of students who are not only academically adept but also well-rounded individuals.",8.0
"Some people think the news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A lot of millennials are of the notion that daily updates from the world do not play a vital role in the life of an individual. It is merely time wastage to read newspapers and watch the news on the television. I partially agree with the aforementioned statement and will discuss both sides of the topic.

Analysing the statement, many people believe that, nowadays, watching updates related to the personal lives of famous people which usually includes sportsmen, actors, actresses, business tycoons and politicians is futile. They feel observing this newsnews not only waste their time but also leaves a negative impact on the lives of an individual, especially youth and teenagers. It is believed youth easily get influenced by their choices, behaviour and fashion trends which usually have a negative effect on them.

Due to ,globalisation it has become important to keep ourselves updated with the happenings of the world. Moreover, it also enriches our knowledge and enhances our vocabulary. To add to this, global news keeps us informed about the latest discoveries and innovations.

To recapitulate, in my view, news broadcasting is really helpful and knowledgeable as it keeps us up-to-date with emerging technologies and events happening across the globe; however, sometimes the news related to the personal lives of famous personalities is completely useless and a waste of time.

While some argue that consuming news is merely a waste of time with no real impact on one's life, I strongly disagree with this assertion. Instead, I believe that the news provides a critical link to the world, enhancing our decision-making abilities and keeping us informed about significant events and trends. 

Firstly, the news serves as a vital tool in keeping us updated with current affairs, both globally and locally. By staying informed about political developments, health updates, and economic changes, we are better positioned to make sound decisions in our personal and professional lives. For example, news stories about climate change and environmental policies have influenced individuals to adopt more sustainable lifestyles, thereby directly affecting their day-to-day choices. Similarly, understanding global economic trends allows professionals to anticipate market shifts and make informed career decisions.

Furthermore, the news fosters social awareness and civic engagement by informing the public about critical issues affecting society. Reports on human rights, social justice movements, and public health crises encourage individuals to engage in community discussions and partake in meaningful actions aimed at bringing about change. For instance, media coverage of public movements such as those advocating for racial equality or mental health awareness spurs conversations and education, prompting societal progress that would otherwise remain stagnant.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that some news content related to the trivial aspects of celebrities' lives can appear inconsequential and a distraction. However, it is incumbent upon individuals to discern and prioritize news that significantly impacts their lives. Even entertainment news has its place, offering a respite and cultural insight, which ultimately enriches public discourse and societal engagement.

In conclusion, the relevance of news in our lives cannot be overstated, as it informs, influences, and inspires decisions that culminate in individual and collective progress. Although certain news stories may not always seem directly connected to personal concerns, the ability to choose valuable content enables individuals to remain well-informed global citizens. Therefore, consuming news should not be viewed as a waste of time but rather as an investment in knowledge and participation in a rapidly evolving world.",8.0
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","History always plays a vital role in the journey of mankind.In the modern world, people were more curious to know about the past incidents that happened in the houses they live in. Different people use  different methodologies to identify the past and they have their own reasons to do so. In this essay ,I will discuss  the motive for this and how they dig out the past.

To begin with,people were always eager to know about  ancient events just to ensure that nothing unnatural happened in the place they want to live. Some investigations are done to make sure that it is safe to live in the house. For instance, the public will enquire about the apartment to the neighbourhood and the surroundings like whether any unnatural death or any mystery exists for the property they are going to buy ,due to some superstitious beliefs. However,Some families enquire about the history of the neighbourhood and surroundings to start a friendship with them and the owner can be comfortable while they move in.

Furthermore, society adapts  numerous ways to do this investigation part.Some families will ask directly to the fellow beings in that area,while others prefer to do it themselves by searching the places around them and garage areas. At the same time , the majority fulfil this task by having a deep conversation with the previous owner.

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your improved version!","In recent years, there has been a growing fascination among people in various countries with uncovering the history of the houses or buildings they reside in. This curiosity stems from multiple factors that go beyond mere superstition. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this trend and suggest various methods that individuals can employ to research the history of their homes.

One of the primary reasons for this increased interest is the desire to uncover any historical significance of a property. Many buildings boast a rich history, having served as the residence of notable figures or as the venue for significant events. Knowing this past adds a layer of interest and pride for residents. Additionally, architectural curiosity plays a vital role. Older buildings often feature unique architectural styles that reveal much about the design preferences and technological capabilities of the time they were built, and understanding these can enhance the appreciation of the living space.

Moreover, personal safety and investment security are compelling motives. Potential homeowners often wish to ascertain that no tragic events have occurred within a house or in its vicinity, reassuring themselves of both physical safety and a smooth transition into a new neighborhood. The history of a property can also affect its market value, making such investigations important for financial reasons.

To research a property's history, one can employ several strategies. While conversing with neighbors and previous owners offers firsthand insights, more comprehensive records can be sought through various sources. Public archives and local historical societies house documents that detail the previous ownership, architectural changes, and even past civic issues related to the property. Online databases and genealogical websites can also provide valuable information. Furthermore, engaging professional historians or researchers with expertise in property history can yield detailed reports for those who wish to delve deeper.

In conclusion, the enthusiasm to learn the history of one's home is fueled by a mix of personal interest, historical appreciation, and practical concerns. By using a variety of research methods—ranging from speaking with locals to accessing archival records—individuals can uncover the rich tapestry of events that their homes have witnessed. As more people seek to connect with their surroundings on a deeper level, the exploration of a property's past becomes a rewarding endeavor that fosters a sense of identity and belonging.",8.0
Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental degradation is a rising issue in the contemporary world. According to the number of people, the surge in the price of fuel is a way to mitigate this problem. I agree up to some extent, however, there are other major solutions, mainly restricting waste disposable and deforestation.

Admittedly, increasing the cost of the fuel is a basic option to cope with the environmental issue. Price hike of the ammunition such as petrol and diesel means, less private vehicles usage, as people would opt to other options for transportation such as public transport system; hence air will not be polluted, as there would be less smoke released from vehicles. China, for instance, in 2016, had been able to decrease the air pollution up to 13%, by introducing fuel’s price increase. Thus, price increase of ammunition is one of the basic measure of saving the environment.

On the other hand, I think there are other effective strategies to address the nature related problems. Firstly, banning waste disposable from industries and factories is one way of solving the rising water pollution issue. This is because disposable materials produced from different industries drained off in the sea and contaminate the water. Which in turn is devastating for sea animals. Another viable option is to discourage deforestation. Cutting trees lead to the deficiency of Oxygen, which is an immense requirement for the better environment. For example, International organization of climate protection has conducted a study that each year climate is becoming deteriorating by the 25% decrease in the production of Oxygen, owing to the deforestation. Therefore, controlling disposable products and prohibiting cutting trees enormously assist in keeping the environment safe.

In conclusion, to control the degradation of nature is a sparked topic these days. Some people say that increasing the fuel cost is a way. In my view, this will be helpful up to some extent, but there are other efficient measures such as preventing raw disposable materials and cutting trees.

One proposition is to increase the cost of fuel as a means of addressing global environmental concerns. While this strategy may indeed contribute to reducing fuel consumption and emissions to a certain extent, I believe that a more comprehensive approach addressing various environmental challenges, such as waste disposal and deforestation, is essential for meaningful impact.

To begin with, raising fuel prices can be a useful strategy for discouraging the excessive use of private vehicles and promoting the use of public transportation, consequently reducing air pollution. For instance, China successfully decreased air pollution by 13% in 2016 by raising fuel prices, which led to a significant reduction in vehicle emissions. However, such measures alone are limited in scope, as they primarily target air pollution and may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who rely on vehicles for essential transportation.

In addition to fuel price adjustments, addressing the root causes of diverse environmental problems requires implementing broader strategies. Firstly, enforcing strict regulations on industrial waste disposal could significantly reduce water pollution. Waste from factories often ends up in water bodies, contaminating ecosystems and threatening marine life. For example, strict compliance with waste management policies has the potential to substantially improve water quality and protect aquatic habitats.

Furthermore, tackling deforestation is crucial in maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the availability of essential resources such as oxygen. Deforestation leads to habitat destruction and contributes to climate change and biodiversity loss. Encouraging reforestation and implementing policies against illegal logging would help preserve forests and mitigate the adverse effects of deforestation. The International Organization for Climate Protection highlights that deforestation is linked to a 25% annual decrease in oxygen production, underscoring the urgency of addressing this issue.

In conclusion, while increasing fuel costs can contribute to reducing environmental degradation, it should not be viewed in isolation as the sole solution. A multifaceted approach that includes stringent waste management regulations and measures to prevent deforestation is essential for tackling global environmental problems effectively. Through comprehensive and sustainable strategies, we can work towards safeguarding the environment for future generations.",8.0
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","In contemporary society, some schools removed abilities such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork because they believe that these subjects should not be learned at school as it is better to learn these from family and peers. Therefore, some think that schools should pay attention to studying academics so that students can succeed and pass examinations. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this proposition believe that it is beneficial for students if institutions focus on curriculums. There is no denying that academic knowledge is important to children to apply for jobs in the future. For example, some positions in a company such as manager, analyst, and executive have to use academic knowledge rather than professional skills. Moreover, when kids learn about physical abilities like woodwork in their free time with their friends or family, they can develop relationships through  cooperation. As a result, institutions remove vocational subjects in order to give more time to learn for students.

On the other hand, those who argue this idea think that schools should not decrease the time the educating vocational curricula. It is obvious that when students exceed focus on academic study, they can get a street which makes it impossible to carry. For instance, when some students do not pass the exam, they may get depressed. Furthermore, some companies need people who have  professional abilities.

In conclusion, schools should not teach capacities like dressmaking but should encourage students to be educated in academic subjects so as to succeed. In my view, I strongly agree with this issue because academic subjects are too easy to find work.",6,6.0,"**Revised Feedback on Essay**

Discuss why academic success outweighs vocational skills or vice versa.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - While the essay has a clear structure, the flow between ideas could be improved.

**Overall Summary:**

Your essay provides a fundamental response to the task, presenting both perspectives. However, to achieve a score of 8.0, you need to delve deeper into your arguments, use a broader range of vocabulary, ensure grammatical precision, and create a coherent flow of ideas. Implementing these changes will help develop a thorough and persuasive analysis aligned with your desired score.

While some argue that mastering academic subjects is essential for future professional success, others believe that practical skills play a crucial role in a well-rounded education. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting a viewpoint that supports an integrated approach incorporating both academic and vocational training.

On one side of the argument, there are several compelling reasons why schools should maintain a strong focus on academic achievement. Foremost, academic subjects such as mathematics, science, and languages provide foundational knowledge essential for higher education and various professional careers. In a competitive job market, positions like doctors, engineers, and business analysts require rigorous academic qualifications. For example, a career in software engineering demands comprehensive knowledge of mathematics and computer science concepts that can only be acquired through formal education. Thus, prioritizing academic success is vital to equip students with skills necessary for such specialized careers.

Conversely, dismissing the value of vocational skills overlooks the necessity of holistic development. Practical subjects like cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork cultivate creativity, problem-solving, and hands-on abilities. These subjects can stimulate interests that lead to fulfilling careers in culinary arts, fashion design, or carpentry. Furthermore, skills acquired through vocational training are often applicable in daily life, enhancing students' self-sufficiency and adaptability. For instance, a student learning woodwork not only develops dexterity but also gains a sense of achievement and creativity, which are equally important in personal and professional growth.

The integration of both academic and practical skills in the school curriculum fosters a balanced education system that caters to diverse talents and career aspirations. Preparing students with a combination of rigorous academic knowledge and practical skills empowers them to navigate various life challenges effectively. Moreover, schools can serve as a bridge that connects theoretical concepts with real-world applications, promoting lifelong learning and innovation.

In conclusion, while academic excellence forms the backbone of professional qualifications, practical skills enrich personal and creative development. I firmly believe that schools should not dismiss the importance of vocational subjects but instead aim for an inclusive education system where both academic success and practical expertise are nurtured equally. Such an approach will not only prepare students for a range of careers but also inculcate essential life skills.",8.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some believe that humans should accept the climate change problem and should try to live with this situation, on the contrary, others think it would be better if we understand it and take action to prevent its impacts. While I accept finding a way to stay with it, I believe that it would be better if we can prevent it in advance by being aware of our lifestyles in order to provide a quality of life for us and the coming generations.

First and foremost, climate change is the main problem that humans have faced recently for several decades and it does affect our life beings, while a growing number of research has confirmed that human activity is one of the main causes contributing to this change. Regarding the negative effects of this situation, it is essential for us to take action to avoid further devasting effects of climate change such as losing biodiversity and extinction of existed species. There are simple methods that we can apply to cope with this problem instead of neglecting it. For example, most countries nowadays try to promote clean energy by replacing fossil energy and also encourage domestic businesses to maintain their Carbon emission. These measures can help to secure the future for the younger generation to live in this world peacefully. Consequently, preventing climate change by changing our individual activities is a must and turns out to be the most effective way towards this significant situation.

On the other hand, some people tend to believe that humans should learn to live with climate change. This might be because they prefer to accept nature's outcomes as the best solution since it is hard to prevent the natural phenomenon. Thus, we should take risks on climate change and find other ways to survive. As a result, some technology has been invented to help humans in order to support the changing lifestyles. For instance, there are some innovations established to fight against those effects of climate change such as the system warning for tsunamis and earthquakes as well as drought climate detection for crop protection. With a help of advanced technology, we could possibly stabilize our long lives towards the severe weather condition.

Nonetheless, I partially disagree with the view that we should ignore those changes in weather, but instead, we should be aware of our lifestyles since it is one of the main causes driving an increase in temperature around the world. Trying to live with climate change should always be the value that we keep in mind, but it is not because we intend to do nothing to protect our nature, conversely, we as humans, need to awake and try to prevent it as much as we can to ensure a better place for the next generations.

In conclusion, I am convinced that climate change could be prevented by changing our lifestyles and raising awareness among us. However, in my opinion, it is a necessity to live and learn from the failures that we have made to nature in order to sustain this world effectively.",4,6.5,Failed to generate 'good' feedback within the turn limit.

It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement ? (approximately 250 words),"It is sometimes argued about the importance of the existence of public areas such as squares and parks in modern societies. While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.

On the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American culture’s trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Year’s Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  

On the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.

In conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",10,8.0,"Great job!

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowadays, some people think that art is not a necessary field for students however others thinks it very essential to have it. In this ,essay we will discuss both the sides of having  art subject for children and also my opinion.

Art is a prosperous way to describe our feelings. A report says that 80 per cent of people when drawing some piece of art, so they are trying to show their inner feeling whether it be happiness or sorrow. For example,  A friend of mine was interested in drawing paintings and I used to ask him the reason to draw painting. Therefore, one  day he told me that he try to narrate his inner pain by drawing and painting.

However, this is also true that with the advent of technology people have started focusing more on the development of new technologies. Parents find subjects like arts useless because they know that technology is flourishing and so they also know that their kids can have a good future if they focused more on technology rather than the arts. To illustrate, when I was doing my bachelor of technology the total number of seats available was only 120 in every field. So, in information technology and computer science there was not a single seat of admission left whereas the other branch was approx half vacant. Parents usually say if they studied art subject they will not be able to concentrate on technological subjects.

In my opinion, I think it is very much necessary to have art subject as it makes child body and mind relax. To conclude I would say students feel energetic by doing painting while after looking at today scenario it is also necessary to have these subject classes once  a week as gaining knowledge in the technology field is foremost.",6,6.0,"**Feedback for Improvement:**

Some argue that art is a crucial subject that enhances creativity and emotional intelligence in children, while others view it as less vital compared to subjects that directly contribute to the technological and economic growth of society. This essay will explore both perspectives and present my opinion on the issue.

On one hand, those who assert the importance of art in education argue that it plays a critical role in the holistic development of a child. Art, encompassing a diverse range of activities such as painting, music, and theater, nurtures creativity and imagination, essential skills in today’s innovative world. Engaging in art can be therapeutic; it allows children to express emotions that they might not articulate through words. For example, a study highlighted that students who participated in artistic activities demonstrated improved emotional resilience and empathy. Moreover, art fosters cultural awareness and appreciation, facilitating a more rounded education that goes beyond academic prowess.

Conversely, skeptics of this viewpoint argue that in today's rapidly advancing world, educational emphasis should be placed on subjects that enhance technological skills and economic competitiveness. With industries increasingly valuing technical expertise, parents and educational policymakers often prioritize STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. They believe these areas offer clearer career pathways and job security. In numerous instances, budget constraints in schools lead to art being sidelined, with resources and time redirected towards subjects perceived as more impactful for students' future prospects.

In my opinion, dismissing art as expendable undermines the objective of broad-minded education. While it is undeniable that technological adeptness is crucial, creative subjects like art bring balance by nurturing skills that machines and technology cannot replicate—imagination, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Schools should incorporate an interdisciplinary approach that marries art with technology, thus ensuring that students are not only job-ready but also equipped with the skills to innovate and adapt in changing environments. Art classes, therefore, should not be marginalized but could be scheduled to complement other academic subjects, making the curriculum both comprehensive and diverse.

To conclude, while the prominence of technology cannot be disregarded in the curriculum, art equally deserves a place in education due to its invaluable contribution to a child’s personal development. A balanced approach that integrates both art and technology will foster well-rounded individuals who are innovative and culturally adept.",8.0
"Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",6,6.0,"**Feedback for Improvement:**

While affluent nations frequently extend financial aid to their less prosperous counterparts, this alone has not sufficed to eradicate poverty. I agree that developed countries should offer alternative forms of assistance, specifically in the realms of education, technology transfer, and infrastructure development, to complement financial support and create sustainable progress. 

Financial aid, albeit indispensable for addressing immediate needs, often falls short of long-term poverty alleviation. Monetary support can be quickly depleted without strategic planning, leaving the recipient countries perpetually dependent on further aid. In this context, education emerges as a potent tool to break this cycle. By investing in the educational systems of impoverished nations, developed countries can empower individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to improve their economic prospects and contribute to community development. For example, Finland has invested in teacher training programs in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to improved educational outcomes and fostering a new generation of skilled professionals.

Moreover, the transfer of technology from developed to developing nations can drive economic growth and innovation. Developed nations can share technological advancements in agriculture, energy, and health sectors to help poorer countries overcome systemic challenges. In India, partnerships with Western tech companies have led to advancements in telecommunication, which have both stimulated economic growth and improved access to critical services such as health and education.

Infrastructure development is another critical area where alternative assistance can be highly effective. Instead of merely sending money, rich countries can contribute expertise and resources to build roads, transportation systems, and efficient power grids. This not only helps create jobs but also enhances the economic framework, enabling businesses to thrive and communities to flourish. China's Belt and Road Initiative is one such example, where infrastructure investment has led to improved connectivity and economic integration in participating countries.

In conclusion, while financial aid remains a crucial lifeline for many struggling nations, it must be coupled with strategic, multifaceted assistance to foster lasting change. Through education, technology transfer, and infrastructure development, developed countries can play a transformative role in the global fight against poverty. By doing so, they not only aid in alleviating poverty but also contribute to a more balanced and sustainable global economy.",8.0
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It has been claimed that economic increase in rich countries does not imply more satisfaction for their citizens. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement for two reasons. The first one is that I think that getting richer, even if the person is already rich, will probably make the person feel better, and the second one is that I do not agree with generalizing people’s feelings.

Firstly, we cannot deny that improving the economy in a rich country would contribute to the better well-being of people, increasing their life quality standards. One example of this is Finlandia, this country is one of the happiest nations in the world and its wealth index is enormous. People have time to dedicate to their families instead of working all day and children attend school only for three hours, having the best education system with the highest educational standards. All this contributes to an improvement of the national economy, making feel its citizens happier as their work-life balance gets better. 

Secondly, I think that the majority of citizens may be happier in case of economic improvement. However, not everything in life is about the economy, and I think that this may be related to why some people are not feeling better with this “good news”. Nowadays, individuals are very confused about life, and even if they are wealthy, money cannot resolve what a person feels or desires. Statistics show the highest suicide rates in the richest countries, which proves that being economically stable and rich does not guarantee happiness.

In conclusion, even if some experts believe that an additional increase in the economy in a rich country would not make a difference among their citizens, I think that it would definitely contribute to the better well-being of most people increasing their quality of life standards and satisfaction levels. However, some sectors of society may be experiencing other issues in their lives that do not let them pain attention to other good things, like feeling happier because their country and their people are acceding to a better lifestyle standard. The economy may benefit people and bring stability into their lives but it cannot guarantee happiness for everyone.",7,6.5,"**Task Response:**

Your essay provides a clear opinion on the topic, which is a strong start. However, to achieve a higher score, consider acknowledging opposing viewpoints to demonstrate a well-rounded argument. For instance, you may want to discuss scenarios where additional economic growth might not lead to increased satisfaction for all citizens, providing a more nuanced view.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The structure of your essay, with distinct sections (introduction, body, conclusion), is generally effective. However, the linkage between some ideas could be improved. Ensure that each paragraph starts with a strong topic sentence that outlines the main point and connects back to your thesis. For example, when discussing Finland, you could more explicitly state how this connects directly to citizen satisfaction. Transition words and phrases should be used more consistently to ensure a smooth flow from one point to the next.

**Lexical Resource:**

While you have employed some good vocabulary, there is room for sophistication. Avoid informal language or phrases like ""good news"" and strive for more precise and varied vocabulary. For example, instead of ""feel better,"" you could use ""enhance emotional well-being."" Familiarize yourself with a wider range of synonyms to convey nuanced meanings more effectively.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

You have demonstrated a range of sentence structures, which is positive. However, there are some errors impacting clarity. For example, ""making feel its citizens happier"" should be ""making its citizens feel happier."" Pay attention to punctuation and aim to avoid run-on sentences. It would be beneficial to proofread your work thoroughly or use tools to check for grammatical accuracy.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Broaden the scope of your argument by considering and discussing both sides of the debate.

However, whether this continual accumulation of wealth translates to genuine satisfaction for the populace is an intriguing debate. In my opinion, while a wealthier nation can offer its citizens numerous tangible benefits, additional economic growth does not necessarily equate to heightened happiness or satisfaction across the board.

To start with, it is well-documented that an increase in economic wealth can enhance the standard of living of a nation’s citizens. Services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure significantly improve with additional financial resources. Take, for instance, the Scandinavian countries like Finland, which consistently top the charts in terms of happiness indices. Beyond their economic affluence, these nations reinvest into public services that prioritize citizens' quality of life, offering a compelling balance between work and personal life, which on the surface enhances citizen satisfaction.

However, while these Scandinavian examples suggest a correlation between wealth and happiness, the relationship is not purely linear or absolute. Beyond a certain threshold of affluence, economic gains may have diminishing returns concerning individual contentment. A 2020 study by the University of California negated the direct correlation between increased GDP and personal satisfaction, highlighting that once basic and moderate needs are met, further financial gains do not substantially increase happiness. Factors like mental health, societal relationships, and individual purpose often weigh more heavily on a person's sense of satisfaction than mere financial wealth.

Moreover, economic statistics reveal that some wealthy countries grapple with higher incidences of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The World's Happiness Report often cites that while measures of wealth are improving, social issues such as inequality, lack of community, and stress are also on the rise, suggesting that money alone is not the antidote to dissatisfaction. Thus, while a richer nation might afford luxuries and conveniences, it does not insulate its citizens from prevalent issues that significantly impact individual well-being.

In conclusion, I posit that while additional economic growth in wealthy nations can provide platforms for better services and infrastructure, it does not inherently guarantee increased satisfaction or happiness. Satisfaction is multifaceted, and as societies become more affluent, the interplay of economic, social, and emotional factors becomes even more complex. Therefore, nations striving for holistic growth must strike a balance between economic and social policies that prioritize overall citizen well-being. Ultimately, happiness might lie in realms that extend beyond the tangible reach of economic wealth.",8.0
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The industrial revolution has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for a large section of the world population. But it has not been able to catch up with the ever-increasing population that has more than doubled in the last half a century. In this essay we will discuss specifically how lack of growth aspirations of nations deprives its citizens of means to feed itself and how too much of it  causes environmental impact for the next generation.

To begin with, we should understand that the immediate solution to the hunger problem is by alleviating people from their poverty. This can be done by creating employment opportunities through the introduction of free-market policies by the government which can help incubate new businesses and also existing businesses to thrive. It is clearly a win-win situation all around because it is an organic way to solve a systemic problem.  

On the other hand, traditional means of growing food such as agriculture and horticulture will have to be scaled to meet the growing demand of the population. This will mean acquiring land through deforestation and creating new water systems by building dams. Although this would create employment opportunities for the local people, it will also affect the environment because the flora and fauna will be completely destroyed. The entire ecosystem that depended on them will also vanish over a period of time affecting the future generations and subjecting them to unknown challenges.

Today's generation has to make sure the economy continues to grow such that earning opportunities are available for everyone.

It is vital to find a balance between the two perspectives to foster sustainable development. This essay aims to examine both sides of the argument and ultimately advocate for an approach that harmonizes economic advancement with ecological preservation.

The proponents of economic growth argue that it serves as a crucial driver in alleviating poverty and hunger by creating wealth and employment opportunities. Economic expansion stimulates investment, encourages the establishment of businesses, and enhances productivity, thereby increasing the income levels of individuals. For instance, countries implementing free-market policies have witnessed significant poverty reduction as enterprises flourish and job opportunities multiply. Moreover, with rising income, people have greater access to essential resources such as food, education, and healthcare, improving their quality of life.

Nonetheless, economic growth often comes at an environmental cost. Traditional methods of boosting production, like extensive agriculture and industrialization, frequently involve deforestation and over-extraction of natural resources, leading to ecological degradation. The construction of dams and irrigation systems can disrupt habitats and threaten biodiversity, culminating in severe long-term consequences such as climate change. Consequently, unchecked economic expansion can compromise the welfare of future generations by jeopardizing the planet's ecological balance.

While acknowledging the necessities underpinning both arguments, it is imperative to embrace a development strategy that integrates economic progression with environmental sustainability. By investing in green technologies and renewable energy, industries can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and dependence on non-renewable resources. This approach not only supports growth but also safeguards the environment by fostering sustainable agricultural practices that bolster food security without damaging the ecosystem.

In conclusion, economic growth possesses the potential to eliminate hunger and poverty, provided it is pursued in a manner considerate of environmental constraints. It is incumbent upon today's generation to embrace innovative solutions that not only fuel economic development but also ensure environmental stewardship. Only through such a balanced and cohesive strategy can we hope to secure a prosperous and sustainable future for all.",8.0
Nowadays many job seekers are finding jobs that force them to move for from their family and friends. Is it a positive or a negative trend? What can be done about it?,"Recently, long-distance jobs have society's attention even if they have to neglect their loved ones. Although this type of work offers a higher salary, the employer will have to face drawbacks in the mentality.

On one hand, an occupation that requires travelling long routes, and immigration usually offer a high salary to support the potential workers' new living conditions, and transportation fees. As said, it is a positive opportunity for those seeking  a well-paid position as it too provides the opportunity in travelling abroad or out of boredom, and learn new things. For example, being a professor in Australia is around 10 times paid more than in Thailand. Not only does it delivers great income but, it besides gives us chances to acquire new knowledge and experiences. Thus, those who seek this job kind still eager to be able to raise their family well afterwards. 

On the other hand, it can be negative, as someone may neglect their family and friends to keep consistent with work where they believe can bring their goals. Therefore, the workforce should provide a clear timeline to be a part of their well-being both mentally, and physically to let job seekers well justify their work-life balance. For instance, full-time jobs in the long-distance are evident that workers need to be occupied in the office for years consecutively. Since work performance is associated with a worker's psychological being and interpersonal skills which are likely to decline on a bad day. Hence, providing a gap time is considered important for the condition, especially for those who emigrate.

This essay will explore the positives and negatives of such a trend and propose actionable solutions that can help ameliorate any resulting challenges.

On one hand, the opportunity to work in a distant location often comes with the promise of a lucrative salary package, which acts as a substantial motivation for individuals seeking financial and career advancement. Jobs requiring relocation often offer competitive remuneration that compensates for living expenses in potentially higher cost areas, as well as covering the cost of frequent return trips home. For example, a software engineer relocating to Silicon Valley may not only receive a significant salary increment but also benefit from exposure to the cutting-edge technology landscape, thereby furthering their professional development. Alongside financial gains, such international job positions can enrich an individual’s experience through cultural immersion and skill acquisition, potentially boosting their career trajectory significantly.

Conversely, the negatives associated with accepting distant job offers cannot be overlooked, as they impact personal relationships and mental health. Prolonged absence from family and friends can lead to a sense of isolation and hinder one’s ability to maintain a supportive social network. Consequently, this isolation can provoke feelings of loneliness and affect one’s psychological well-being. For instance, medical professionals who move abroad may find themselves consumed by work commitments, resulting in limited time for social interaction or family visits. Furthermore, the added pressure to perform in an unfamiliar environment can exacerbate stress levels. This indicates a pressing need for employers to prioritize employee well-being by adopting policies that facilitate work-life balance.

To mitigate these challenges, organizations should implement measures that allow for a harmonious balance between work commitments and personal life. Providing employees with flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options or opportunities for short sabbaticals, can enable them to maintain connections with family and friends without compromising their professional responsibilities. Moreover, establishing mentorship programs and social support systems within the workplace can help alleviate feelings of seclusion and foster a sense of community among workers. Importantly, employees should be encouraged to take full advantage of their leave entitlements to refresh and rejuvenate, thereby maintaining a healthy work-life equilibrium.

In conclusion, while long-distance job positions bring with them numerous professional benefits, they also pose significant challenges in terms of personal well-being and social relationships. Employers and employees alike must take proactive steps to address these issues, ensuring long-term job satisfaction and personal contentment. It is only by doing so that the allure of lucrative employment can effectively coexist with a supportive social and family life.",8.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers.

While some see this as a progressive step toward open dialogue and improvement, others worry it could erode respect and discipline within the classroom. This essay will discuss both viewpoints before presenting my opinion.

On the one hand, encouraging feedback from students is seen as beneficial because it can lead to improvements in teaching methods and greater student engagement. When students are given the chance to express their opinions constructively, teachers receive valuable insights into what works and what does not from the perspective of those directly involved in the learning process. For instance, if students express that a particular teaching method is ineffective, the teacher can adjust their approach, leading to better understanding and higher student satisfaction. Moreover, this kind of engagement can motivate students, making them feel valued and more invested in their education.

On the other hand, some people argue that allowing students to criticize teachers can lead to a decline in respect and discipline. In cultures where teachers are traditionally seen as authority figures, questioning their methods may be perceived as disrespectful. This situation could potentially disrupt classroom dynamics, leading to a lack of order and an increased difficulty for teachers to maintain control. For example, if students frequently criticize teachers without constructive intentions, it could lead to a hostile environment that is not conducive to learning.

While both perspectives offer valid points, I believe the key lies in how feedback is facilitated. Encouraging student feedback should be handled with clear guidelines to ensure it is respectful and constructive. Teachers should be trained to welcome feedback as part of professional development, viewing it as an opportunity for growth rather than a challenge to their authority. Equally, students should be educated about how to provide constructive criticism, focusing on objective observations rather than personal attacks.

In conclusion, while the possibility of diminished respect and discipline is a valid concern, the potential benefits of improved teaching quality and student engagement make a compelling case for encouraging student feedback. With the right systems in place, such feedback can be a powerful tool for enhancing educational outcomes without jeopardizing classroom harmony.",8.0
"Some people believe that the main benefit of international cooperation is the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world of business. Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have different views as to whether the environment or the world’s economy and businesses benefit most from global cooperation. Personally, I contend that the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend.

One the one hand, when the world becomes a global village, environmental protection turns out to be a common concern and is addressed on a global scale. Kyoto Protocol, which is an international treaty that imposes limitations on CO2 emissions on member nations, helps to reduce a significant amount of the gas into the atmosphere. Were this treaty not brought to life by concerted efforts of many nations, our carbon footprint would be much greater and the damage we did to our planet would be more severe. Moreover, given countries are inexorably linked to each other economically and politically, the wealthier ones could introduce environmentally linked aid to poorer countries with a view to curb their uncontrolled paces of industrialization. Whatever the results of these practices, at least collective attempts made worldwide brings a great impact on individual consciousness, which prompts individuals to act environmentally responsibly.

However, I believe that economic prosperity is the main by-product of global integration. Thanks to an increasingly free global market, a number of undeveloped nations are being lifted out of poverty through either exporting their strengths or foreign investments. This is not likely to happen in times of political isolation had been the norm since the flows of goods, money, and humans were limited within national boundaries or regional borders. Furthermore, global cooperation enables transnational or international corporations to locate their manufacturing facilities on the other side of the world where cheap and abundant labours could make a huge difference in price production, leaving them an edge over their rivals.

In conclusion, I think, even though international cooperation could bring about some initiatives regarding environmental preservation it is the world of business that benefits most from the development.",8,7.0,"Thank you for submitting your essay.

While some individuals assert that the primary advantage lies in environmental protection, others argue that the sphere of business reaps the most rewards. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on the matter.

On the one hand, international collaboration has played a pivotal role in addressing pressing environmental issues on a global scale. Agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord demonstrate a unified commitment to curbing climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This treaty exemplifies how nations collectively strive to minimize their carbon footprint, contributing to the protection of ecosystems worldwide. Furthermore, international partnerships facilitate the exchange of environmental technology and expertise. For instance, countries with advanced renewable energy technology can assist developing nations in adopting sustainable practices, ultimately leading to a greener planet.

Conversely, the realm of business significantly benefits from global cooperation. The rise of multinational corporations and the expansion of international trade have fostered economic growth and prosperity across nations. For example, countries like China and India have seen substantial economic advancement due to increased foreign investments and participation in the global market. Additionally, the open exchange of goods and services worldwide enables businesses to tap into new markets, enhancing their competitive edge and driving innovation. The collaboration between countries also helps establish standard business practices, easing trade barriers and reducing costs.

In my opinion, though both sectors gain from international coordination, the business world likely derives more substantial and immediate advantages. Global economic integration has the potential to alleviate poverty and improve living standards by creating job opportunities and spurring development. Moreover, the growth of international business networks not only stimulates market efficiency but also fosters diplomatic relations, creating a more interconnected and peaceful global community.

In conclusion, while international efforts towards environmental protection are undeniably important and beneficial, the sphere of business seems to reap more significant benefits from global cooperation. The economic prosperity engendered by these collaborations not only boosts individual nations' wealth but also promotes a more harmonious global society.",8.0
Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree),"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what label 8 writing may look like.

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that it is possible to resolve a part of environmental problems if the cost of fuel for the personal and commercial transport will significantly increase. I particularly agree with this statement and in this essay, I will try to explain why. 

On the one hand, burnable fuel it is the main resource of energy in modern world, and the cost of the fuel has a great impact for the cost of food and goods, hence people try to save their money what extend to conscious consumption of the fuel and more effective logistic ways. Therefore, the fuel economy is decreased amount of the pollution to the environment which has a positive influence on the nature. Moreover, cost of fuel extends to developing of advanced technology and it is a fact that modern cars have a less exhaust of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than earlier. For example, Scandinavian countries stimulate people to keep the fuel economy policy and to have modern vehicles by way to cancellation of taxes to the owners of cars with zero emissions. 

On the other hand, increasing the cost of the fuel in poor countries, could stimulate people to use mo cheaper and dirtier fuel, which only increases air pollution.",0,5.5,"To achieve your desired score of 8.0, here are some detailed comments and feedback to enhance different aspects of your essay:

1. **Task Response:**
   - Your essay partially addresses the task by discussing the potential effects of increasing fuel costs on the environment. However, it lacks a balanced discussion. To improve, provide a clearer stance and evenly weigh the advantages and disadvantages of increasing fuel costs as a solution to environmental problems. Introduce more arguments and evidence to support your point of view.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - While your essay has a structured approach, there are areas for improvement in logic flow. The transition between ideas could be smoother.

While some advocate for this measure as an effective strategy to encourage sustainable practices, others argue it poses significant economic burdens, particularly on developing nations. In my opinion, although there are merits to the argument, this solution needs to be part of a broader strategy that considers diverse socio-economic contexts.

On the one hand, raising fuel costs could incentivize individuals and organizations to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. The rise in fuel prices could lead to reduced consumption, promoting fuel efficiency and the adoption of alternative energy sources. For instance, if fuel becomes more expensive, individuals might opt for public transportation, carpooling, or shift towards electric or hybrid vehicles, thereby lessening the reliance on fossil fuels and subsequently decreasing carbon emissions. As seen in several Scandinavian countries, incentives such as tax exemptions for zero-emission vehicle owners have significantly reduced the carbon footprint in these regions.

Additionally, a higher fuel cost could drive advancements in green technology and infrastructure development. As the demand for fossil fuels declines, investment in renewable energy sources and technologies may increase, pushing industries towards sustainable innovation. This could result in more job opportunities in green sectors and potentially reduce long-term reliance on nonrenewable resources.

On the contrary, one must contend with the socio-economic repercussions, particularly for less affluent nations. Increases in fuel prices tend to raise the cost of goods and services, disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals and families who spend a larger portion of their income on essential commodities. This approach might push people towards cheaper, and often dirtier, fuel alternatives, which could exacerbate pollution rather than mitigate it.

Moreover, without adequate infrastructure and alternatives in place, such an increase could lead to transportation challenges, further impinging on economic productivity and societal welfare. Policymakers must ensure that measures are not only environmentally beneficial but also socially equitable.

In conclusion, while increasing the cost of fuel can be part of the solution to environmental issues by promoting cleaner energy use, it should not be a standalone policy. Governments should accompany fuel price hikes with investments in public transportation, incentives for clean energy use, and protective measures for economically vulnerable populations. Only by creating a balanced approach can we address these concerns effectively and equitably.",8.0
"""The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?""","With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.

First and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens.",9,8.5,"Great job!

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","It is becoming increasingly interesting for people to find out the background story of the house or building they reside in. The major reason behind this is curiosity about their residents. Some ways could be done to research the history, such as interviewing the local neighbourhoods, going to libraries or searching it online. 

There are some motives for people to explore the past of the place where they live. Firstly, it is because curiosity is the nature of human beings. Therefore, they tend to wonder about the origin of something, including their residents. This exploration could be beneficial for  homeowners since they can gather information about their houses and the important histories behind them. As an example, in the Conjuring movie, the homeowner and the paranormal tried to find the history of the house in order to reveal the reasons behind the haunted experience that the homeowner experienced. By gathering the data, they could also find out about the old times of the building’s structure, whether it ever experienced a disaster or something else, so when they want to renovate it, they would take some precautionary measures to avoid the same things that happened before. 

There are some kinds of activities that could help the owner to reveal the secrets of their residents. First, they can ask their neighbours about the house. It could be an effective way if the person that they interviewed has lived there for a long time. Additionally, local people are familiar with the surroundings. Therefore, they could give a specific story about the house. Secondly, the local library could be one of the options if the authority has good documentation about the area. To illustrate, the government of the Dutch East Indies has a good archive of Surabaya’s maps, which will give advantages in the research. Lastly, we could utilize the Internet. The internet provides a bunch of information that can be accessed by the public. For example, Google Maps has a feature to look back at the old maps in real view, which helps us to find out the chronicles. 

To conclude, people like to discover the past stories of their buildings because they are curious about them.

There are several compelling reasons behind this growing interest, ranging from cultural and historical curiosity to practical financial considerations. Additionally, modern research methods have made it more accessible for individuals to explore this aspect of their residences.

The desire to uncover the history of one’s dwelling is often fueled by an innate human curiosity and a yearning to connect with the past. People are naturally drawn to stories about previous occupants or significant events associated with their homes. Historical insights could deepen an owner’s emotional connection to their residence, offering a unique narrative that enriches their living experience. Furthermore, understanding the cultural and historical significance of a building can also foster a sense of pride and identity within a community. For instance, properties with a storied past may embody unique architectural features or represent an era of great cultural transformation, making them cherished community landmarks.

On a practical level, knowledge of a property’s history might also influence its economic value. Properties with a rich history or distinctive characteristics can be more attractive to potential buyers, thus enhancing their marketability and possibly increasing their value.

In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the statement given, and I will elaborate on it in this essay.

On the one hand, today, some nations have compulsory education so their youngsters can learn knowledge in school. Moreover, when they back to their home, their caregivers can assist them so they learn more. However, some families have inhospitable environments for children in which those people cannot learn reading and writing skills in their house. For example, if their mother or father is an alcoholic, they cannot teach their offspring and some use violence to heat their scions, so they feel afraid to learn everything. As a result, they do not have any bills, so we must spend funds on those young folks.

Furthermore, the majority of adults can get a job which can earn salaries, and it is not an illegal thing. But, in many countries, heirs cannot get a job because of the law. In addition, numerous youngsters are influenced by adults, so if they cannot receive cash from their government, they will lose their opportunity to learn literacy. For instance, in South Korea, many old communities cannot write or read because, when they were young individuals, South Korea was at war, so they could not learn literacy. But when they become adults, they can learn writing and reading skills. Therefore, we must protect children from those environments.

In conclusion, I completely disagree with this topic. Children who have bad guardians, cannot enough learn literacy. Conversely, many adults can learn those skills because they can get a job as well as pay. So, we should spend money on those young people because they are precious people in our lives.",7,5.5,"To achieve the desired score of 8.0, there are specific areas where improvements can be made in your essay:

1. **Task Response**:
   - Your essay presents a strong personal opinion but lacks depth in addressing the opposite side of the argument. To reach a higher score, it is crucial to provide a balanced view by acknowledging the importance of adult literacy and the reasons why some might prioritize it over children's education. Expanding on this counterargument can make your essay more comprehensive. You could discuss how adult literacy can influence economic development or the benefits it brings to society as a whole in terms of improved parenting and workforce capabilities.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**:
   - The essay needs clear linkages between ideas and paragraphs. Some points appear abruptly or unsupported. Introduce linking phrases such as ""in addition,"" ""similarly,"" ""on the contrary,"" ""however,"" etc., to improve the flow. Ensure every paragraph has a clear main idea and supports your thesis, logically transitioning from one point to the next. For example, when transitioning to discuss how adults can later learn literacy, you might say, ""Despite the challenges faced in youth, adults have opportunities to enhance their skills later in life.""

3. **Lexical Resource**:
   - While your vocabulary is varied, some word choices are awkward or incorrect. Words like ""scions"" and ""heirs"" feel out of place. Carefully review word choices for accuracy and consider using terms that are more appropriate to the context (e.g., ""children,"" ""students,"" ""adults""). Work on expanding your academic vocabulary and ensure you use it precisely. Use synonyms and vary your vocabulary to prevent repetition and enhance readability.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**:
   - There are several grammatical errors, particularly in sentence structure, comma usage, and tense. For example, ""heat"" in ""use violence to heat their scions"" is likely a typo. Proofreading is essential to eliminate such errors. Practice constructing more complex sentences and using a variety of grammatical structures to demonstrate a higher level of competence. You could combine sentences to show relationships between your ideas, such as cause and effect, comparison, or contrast.

Overall Suggestions and Improvements:
- Start by refining your thesis statement and making your argument more nuanced by considering the points for and against both sides of the issue.
- Organize your essay with clearer topic sentences and detailed supporting arguments within each paragraph.
- Practice using academic language with precision and eliminate vocabulary errors or awkward phrasing.
- Rework sentence constructions that are unclear or convoluted, focusing on grammatical correctness and fluency.

Overall Summary:
Your essay presents a clear stance and some supporting arguments, but to reach your desired score, additional consideration of opposing views, improved coherence, better lexical choice, and grammatical accuracy is necessary. By addressing these areas and strengthening the structure and content of your essay, you can elevate your writing to meet the higher band criteria. Practice integrating more nuanced ideas and provide a more comprehensive analysis to ensure a balanced and thoroughly developed argument.","Education of young individuals is a fundamental priority for many nations, as it lays the groundwork for a well-informed and progressive society. However, addressing the educational needs of adults who lack basic literacy skills holds significant importance as well. I partially agree with the notion that governments should prioritize adult literacy education alongside that of young people. This essay will explore both perspectives, ultimately favoring a balanced investment in both demographic groups.

On one hand, children's education is a crucial investment, as it prepares the next generation to contribute to economic development and social well-being. Ensuring that children receive a proper education not only empowers them with the skills needed to succeed in life but also reduces the likelihood of poverty and social issues related to unemployment and lack of opportunities. A robust educational system for young people creates a strong foundation upon which they can build their futures, potentially decreasing the need for remedial education later in life.

On the other hand, adult literacy is equally significant for several reasons. Adults who cannot read or write face numerous challenges in their daily lives, such as difficulty accessing healthcare information, understanding financial documents, or engaging in political processes. Furthermore, adult literacy impacts economic development, as educated adults are better equipped to find employment and contribute to the workforce. Educated parents are more likely to value and prioritize the education of their children, positively influencing the next generation.

It is imperative that governments strike a balance when allocating educational resources. Ignoring adult literacy only exacerbates social and economic inequalities, as adults without basic education are often trapped in low-paying jobs and are unable to fully participate in society. Conversely, insufficient investment in children's education could lead to a generation unprepared for the future's challenges.

In conclusion, while the education of young people should not be undermined, the importance of educating adults who lack literacy skills cannot be overlooked. Both elements play a crucial role in the overall development of a society. Therefore, governments should strive to balance their investments in education, addressing the immediate needs of adult literacy while ensuring that young individuals receive quality education to pave the way for sustainable national progress.",8.0

How can people research this?","Most of the people throughout the world are interesting in searching on history of the place they live because of intelligence and they concern that they should be aware of it. In this situation, they are capable of finding out deeds and talking with inhabitants. In this essay, I am going to discuss    problems.

As a whole, human beings should be aware of the place they live in because nations are more intelligent nowadays. They might have many legitimate requirements. Furthermore, some are enthusiastic about those kinds of findings as they need to learn their children about the history of accommodation. For instance, when it is going to enrolling a child on a school, it is necessary to have proof of living place; whenever kids are asking about ancient times, it is necessary to have information of the past.

People could be able to find out historical information on where they live by deeds and inhabitant citizens because they are the most relevant and well-known factors which can be trusted.

For example, even though there are neighbours and compeers surrounded by,  it is impossible to get relevant data on a land accurately without a deed. That is how we are able to find the history of the place or house we live in.

This trend can be attributed to various reasons, including understanding cultural heritage, assessing property values, and ensuring legal and safety standards. In this essay, I will explore these reasons and outline effective methods for researching the history of a property.

One primary reason people are keen on unearthing their home's history is to connect with their cultural heritage. Buildings, especially older ones, often have historical significance tied to the community or region's past. By delving into the history, residents can gain a deeper appreciation of their cultural and social roots, helping them foster a sense of belonging and identity. Furthermore, knowledge of a property's history can significantly impact real estate decisions. Historical homes or buildings are often considered unique, thus increasing their market value. Potential buyers or owners conduct research to determine any historical features that may require preservation or restoration, thereby affecting investment decisions.

Safety and legal considerations also drive people to investigate a property's history. Understanding past events such as natural disasters or structural changes can highlight any potential safety issues or inform buyers of existing legal obligations regarding renovations or improvements. This historical awareness can ensure that residents comply with heritage protection laws and maintain their home's structural integrity.

Researching a property's history can be approached through several methods. Deeds and previous ownership documents provide foundational information about past owners and any significant changes made to the property. Archives and historical societies often house extensive records, offering insights into a building's past through old maps, photographs, or architectural plans. Additionally, many local governments maintain online databases where property histories are accessible, providing detailed legal records and past transactions. Libraries with local history sections can also be invaluable resources, presenting historical narratives and relevant literature about the area's architectural evolution.

In conclusion, the inclination to explore the history of one’s home is fueled by the desire to appreciate cultural heritage, make informed financial decisions, and ensure safety and legal compliance. By utilizing a range of research methods such as deeds, archives, and online platforms, individuals can thoroughly uncover the fascinating history of their dwellings. Understanding this context not only enriches personal knowledge but also enhances the appreciation and value of one’s home.",8.0
Nowadays people have cosmetic surgery to improve life. Why do many more people choose these operations? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people turning to cosmetic surgery. This phenomenon is caused by various reasons and it has stirred up many heated arguments on whether cosmetic surgery is a positive or negative trend. Personally, I see myself siding with the former.

People’s recent preference for cosmetic surgery is said to stem from a number of factors. To begin with, the higher demand for plastic surgery is due to the fact that nowadays, people seem to care more about their physical appearance than ever before, as such, they develop a desire to look more attractive. Therefore, when this mindset is taken into consideration, it is not difficult to explain why there is a rapid growth in the number of people undertaking plastic operations. In addition, the incredible and meteoric development of technology in recent times further contributes to the widespread use of cosmetic procedures. The utilization of highly advanced machinery undoubtedly results in increased efficiency, quality, as well as safety, allowing patients to put more trust in the process.

In my opinion, an individual's wish to become more beautiful is not something that should be criticized or ridiculed owning thank to the fact that

an attractive and pleasing physical appearance can be greatly beneficial, such as remarkably boosting a person’s confidence and self-esteem, or improving one’s sense of happiness. Consequently, I am convinced cosmetic surgery is a viable method for those who want to refine their looks. Nevertheless, it is unwise to abuse plastic surgery, as overusing this method can lead to various health issues. When an individual undertakes a plethora of operations, an exceedingly large quantity of risks will become apparent, these consequences include blood loss, organ damage or even more horrifying, death.

In conclusion, in recent times, cosmetic surgery has greatly soared in popularity, mostly thanks to the fact people are becoming more and more conscious of their outward appearance. In my point of view, the fact that people can have their ideal appearance through cosmetic operations is a positive development, though it would be completely inappropriate to heavily overuse it.",7,6.5,"Certainly!

Continue practicing these elements, and your writing will undoubtedly improve. Keep up the good work!","In contemporary society, the trend of opting for cosmetic surgery has become increasingly prevalent. Several underlying factors contribute to this surge, sparking debates about whether it constitutes a positive or a negative development. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind the growing inclination towards cosmetic procedures and present an argument suggesting that, while beneficial in certain aspects, the trend also poses significant concerns.

Primarily, the burgeoning interest in cosmetic surgery can be attributed to the current societal emphasis on physical appearance. In a world where image often equates to confidence and success, individuals are driven to enhance their aesthetics. Media portrayals and social media platforms perpetuate idealized standards of beauty, fostering an environment where physical perfection is seen as attainable through surgical means. Consequently, this external pressure propels individuals to seek cosmetic interventions as a way to meet societal expectations and improve their self-esteem.

Furthermore, advancements in medical technology have considerably allayed the fears traditionally associated with surgical procedures. Modern cosmetic surgery is characterized by increased precision, safety, and reduced recovery times, making it a more appealing option. The minimization of risks and the promise of optimal outcomes encourage more people to consider these procedures as viable options for self-improvement.

While the pursuit of beauty and confidence are valid reasons for undergoing cosmetic surgery, the phenomenon also has its drawbacks. The emphasis on aesthetic enhancement may lead to an unhealthy obsession with physical appearance. Such societal pressures can foster unrealistic expectations, contributing to a decline in mental well-being for those unable to achieve the prescribed ideals. The ethical implications of propagating a homogenized standard of beauty are also troubling, as they can undermine the appreciation of diverse and authentic individual beauty.

Moreover, excessive reliance on cosmetic surgery can have dire health consequences. The cumulative risks associated with multiple procedures can result in severe complications, such as infection, scarring, or in extreme cases, death. Individuals, driven by the desire for perfection, may fall into a never-ending cycle of surgeries, compromising their physical and psychological health. 

In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery undeniably offers individuals the opportunity to alter their appearance and potentially bolster their confidence, it also reflects deeper societal issues related to beauty standards and self-worth. It is imperative to consider the broader implications of this trend and promote a balanced perspective. Encouraging individuals to appreciate their unique features and fostering a culture of self-acceptance can mitigate the pressures that currently drive the inclination towards cosmetic surgery. Ultimately, recognizing and addressing the complexities involved in this phenomenon is crucial as we navigate its impact on our society.",8.0
"It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.
In conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",7,5.5,"### Feedback and Suggestions

While some assert that innate ability is paramount, others believe that with adequate training and dedication, any child can excel in these areas. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and argue that while natural talent can provide a head start, it is the nurturing of skills through dedicated training that truly drives success.

To begin with, the argument in favor of natural talent is that individuals born with specific aptitudes often exhibit ease and proficiency in their chosen field, which can lead to notable achievements early in life. Such individuals may demonstrate remarkable creativity in art or outstanding physical capabilities in sports, providing them with a competitive edge. For instance, prodigies like Pablo Picasso in art or Serena Williams in tennis displayed exceptional abilities from a young age, suggesting a significant role of inherent talent in their initial success.

However, the doctrines of hard work and dedication cannot be discounted. Numerous examples exist of individuals who have risen to prominence through perseverance and training, irrespective of their starting point. Malcolm Gladwell's assertion in ""Outliers"" that 10,000 hours of practice can lead to mastery is frequently cited to emphasize that consistent effort and learning can yield extraordinary results. Consider the story of Thomas Edison, who famously iterated thousands of times in his pursuit of a working light bulb, proving that persistence can triumph where talent alone may not suffice.

From my perspective, success in art and sports is a product of both nature and nurture. While natural talent can undoubtedly catalyze the process, it is the commitment to refining skills and the resilience in facing challenges that sustain long-term success. Structured training, mentorship, and the willingness to learn and adapt are essential components that can elevate a promising artist or athlete to great heights. Therefore, focusing solely on talent dismisses the critical influence of discipline and exposure to proper guidance.

In conclusion, natural talent serves as a valuable foundation, but it is the continuous development of skills, fueled by motivation and diligent practice, that ultimately leads to success in art and sports. By balancing innate abilities with rigorous training and an unwavering drive to improve, anyone—regardless of their initial level of talent—can achieve excellence in their chosen field.",8.0
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that voluntary work should be compulsory for teenagers to get benefits from both the individual and society as a whole. I completely disagree with the opinion and think that we should not force the youths to do unpaid work.

First of all, I believe that imposing the ounpaid work on the teenager can cause more burden on them for their studies, which may pit adverse effect on their health too. As we know, there is a lot of syllabus in school; However, after coming back from school, young ones have to do their homework with numerous assignments and projects at home. Whenever they get leisure time, we should encourage them to utilize that period by doing physical exercise and playing sports otherwise, they may become unhealthy. For instance, In Canada, the students who are working in stores have been seen showing less progress in studies as compared to those who do not need to work. That is why Instead of compelling them to work, we should be given the time to concentrate on studies to accomplish outstanding grades.

At the same time, so do not believe that society and teenagers would gain any advantage by doing unpaid work.  It would be unfair for youngsters and society to do anything without their willingness, as it can lead to resentment amongst young people who would feel that they were being used. Furthermore, it is also against our democratic rules of the nation, which would increase the rate if crime in countries. For example, it has been seen that forcefully work causes rebellious in youths which put a negative effect on our society. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system. 

To conclude, I strongly believe that volunteer work should not be mandatory for teenagers because it badly effects on their education and even on our society.",9,6.0,"**Feedback for Improving the Essay:**

Good luck, and keep practicing!","In today's society, the question of whether teenagers should be required to engage in unpaid community work during their free time is a contentious one. While some argue that it provides mutual benefits for both the individual and society, I disagree with this notion and believe that voluntary work should remain a matter of choice rather than compulsion.

Firstly, imposing mandatory community work on teenagers could place undue strain on their already hectic schedules. Adolescence is a crucial academic period, and young people must dedicate considerable time to their studies to ensure a successful future. The modern educational system demands that students complete various assignments, projects, and examinations, leaving them with limited leisure time. Adding unpaid work to this mix might impair their academic performance and adversely affect their mental and physical health. For instance, a study in Canada showed that students who engage in numerous extracurricular and academic commitments are at risk of increased stress levels and diminished academic outputs compared to their peers who focus solely on their education.

Moreover, I firmly contend that compelling teenagers to do community service could lead to resentment and a lack of genuine commitment. Volunteering should stem from a sincere desire to contribute, not from obligation or coercion. When teenagers are forced to participate, their lack of enthusiasm may lead to substandard work, negating any potential benefits for the community. Furthermore, this mandate contradicts the democratic principles of freedom and choice, potentially fostering discontent and a rebellious attitude among the youth.

On the other hand, some might argue that unpaid work teaches teenagers invaluable life skills and instills a sense of social responsibility. While this is a valid point, these lessons can also be learned through voluntary participation in activities that interest them, such as school clubs or local organizations. Encouraging, rather than obligating teenagers and providing them with a variety of opportunities, would ensure a more passionate and enthusiastic involvement, benefiting both individuals and the community.

In conclusion, while the benefits of unpaid community work are undeniable, mandating such activities would undermine teenagers' autonomy and could have detrimental effects on their academic and personal development. The choice to volunteer should be left in the hands of the teenagers, fostering a genuine commitment to and appreciation for community service.",8.0
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?
Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 
You should write at least 250 words.","Nowadays the percentage of people, which want to have a child in their middle age is rising. This essay will discuss the reasons why it occurs and will provide arguments for its advantages and disadvantages.
In my opinion the rise in the rate of people, who decided to have children in their later age than in the past is due to reason: desire to build stronger financial bases for future family. More young people realize that to carry about children and provide them with all necessary needs are not cheap and all this thing requires a sustainable financial source. That is why a lot of people try firstly to build a successful career, which results in forming a strong financial basement and only after that to plan a child. For example, a lot of Russian survey's results demonstrate that the lack of enough money is the main reason of delaying of planning children. 
There are advantages and disadvantages of this statement. From one point of view, it is better to have a child in more wealthy conditions because all our and child's demand would be satisfied. For instance, to take care of children and provide them with a quality access to all necessary services, which impact on their development, require a lot of financial investments. 
On the other hand it is bad to have children in later age because of physical opportunities  for mothers. Childbirth is a strong stress on women's health and according to evolution from year to year women's body does not become younger and stronger for bringing a birth of a baby.

This essay will delve into potential reasons behind this shift and examine whether its advantages surpass the associated disadvantages.

One of the primary reasons people choose to delay parenthood is to establish a robust financial foundation, ensuring they can adequately provide for their children's needs. In today's competitive environment, many young adults prioritize career advancement and financial stability before embarking on parenthood. For instance, research indicates that a significant proportion of couples in countries like Russia and the USA delay having children due to financial constraints, favoring elements like stable income and savings over immediate parenthood. This approach can lead to a more prosperous family life, where children have access to quality education, healthcare, and recreational opportunities, facilitating more comprehensive development.

Apart from financial stability, delaying childbirth can also allow individuals to mature emotionally and establish personal and professional identities before taking on parental responsibilities. A matured mindset often leads to better parenting choices, as parents are likely to be more emotionally stable and patient. Consequently, children raised under such environments may benefit from a supportive and nurturing upbringing.

However, there are notable disadvantages. The primary concern revolves around health implications, especially for mothers. As women age, the risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth increase, including complications like gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and the possibility of genetic anomalies. Nevertheless, remarkable advancements in reproductive medicine have mitigated many of these risks, supporting older women to experience healthy pregnancies.

In conclusion, while there are undeniable challenges associated with having children later in life, the advantages related to financial and emotional readiness often outweigh these disadvantages. With the support of advanced medical care, parents can effectively address health concerns, leading to a well-rounded family dynamic. Hence, for many, the decision to delay parenthood is a strategic choice that serves not only their personal goals but also the future well-being of their family. Such a well-considered approach can indeed contribute to a balanced and satisfying parenting experience.",8.0
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is a fact that some celebrities become more popular for their luxurious lifestyles and possessions these days rather than for their mesmerising accomplishments. To a certain extent, this kind of popularity tends to lead young people in the wrong direction. However, there are also some celebrities who got to the place that they are at the moment for their actions and accomplishments.

On the one hand, some celebrities pursued easy ways to get famous such as getting married to a popular or rich person, living a fancy, shopaholic lifestyle or even doing unbelievable things and streaming live sessions. Moreover, it has become easier as social media platforms such as TikTok and instagram turned into a spotlight especially for those kinds of people. For  instance, the Kardasian family members are now billionaires with all the money gained from their reality show and hot topics of Hollywood despite the fact that not even one of them has a talent such as acting, singing or doing sports. Additionally, a group of TikTokers named Hype House is such a hit and on the tip of the tongue of every teenager these days but what they are doing are inappropriate performances, dances, partying and even breaking rules and restrictions during the pandemic. Such kinds of influences only aim to gain publicity and send a wrong message to the youngsters that successful life means wealth and accessories and it does not have to be meaningful.

On the contrary, it is great to have such kinds of famous people who live with compassion and put their great efforts to gain success in life. From their perspective, a way to success is a combination of passion, hard work and strong determination. Those are the people who apply themselves in developing their skills and abilities through perseverance. As an example, a korean boy label named BTS is nowadays among the most famous celebrities in this 21st century. They came all the way from South Korea and broke amazing records one by one in a way that no South Koreans have ever done before. All the members came from rural areas of their country to Seoul and worked so hard even before their debut. As a result, now they’ve become a tourism ambassador of their country and worked with the United Nations to help improve the mental health of youths under the program called “Love yourself”. Due to their hard work, now, they’ve set a great example and become idols to young people all over the world and made those youngsters believe in themselves and their worth.

In conclusion, it is true that as various types of social media platforms are being accessible these days, children are likely to be influenced by the so-called celebrities. Anyway, there are still some famous people who can make young people believe that their dreams could come true with hard work and passion. Thus, in my opinion, I think it is best if young people become more selective with choosing their role models.",5,7.5,"To help you reach your desired score of 8.0, I'll provide detailed feedback based on the four key IELTS assessment criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy.

While some young people may idolize such figures, believing material success is life’s ultimate goal, I firmly assert that the focus on superficial fame can be detrimental, although there are still commendable public figures who truly inspire with their achievements.

Indeed, the rise of social media has given a platform to individuals who gain fame by flaunting extravagant lifestyles rather than through exceptional skills or talents. This phenomenon is evidenced by personalities like the Kardashian-Jenner family, whose popularity largely stems from their high-profile reality show and extravagant displays of wealth. Rather than showcasing artistic or athletic talents, they often epitomize consumerism and glamour. Similarly, groups such as the Hype House on TikTok attract vast attention through simple, often trivial content. While entertaining, these representations can inadvertently suggest to young people that success is primarily measured by financial status and aesthetics, neglecting the importance of hard-earned achievements.

Conversely, it’s essential to highlight that there exist celebrities whose rise to the spotlight stems from genuine talent and hard work. Take, for instance, the Korean pop group BTS, globally admired not only for their musical prowess but also for their dedication, resilience, and positive influence on global youth. Through years of rigorous training and persistence, they have shattered numerous records and contributed to meaningful societal campaigns, such as their collaboration with the United Nations in promoting mental health awareness through their ""Love Yourself"" initiative. Such figures are vital in showing young people that dedication and integrity, rather than mere wealth, lie at the heart of true success.

In summary, while a segment of celebrity culture encourages young people to emulate superficial success, it is crucial to emphasize the stories of those who have gained recognition through genuine achievements, as they offer more substantial role models. Encouraging discernment in choosing whom to admire can help young people focus on developing their passions and understand that perseverance and virtue lead to lasting and meaningful success.",8.0

Several factors contribute to this trend, and finding effective solutions is crucial for improving academic outcomes. This essay will explore these reasons and propose solutions to enhance students' focus in school.

One primary reason for diminished concentration among children is the pervasive influence of technology. Today, students have unprecedented access to digital devices and the internet. While these tools can facilitate learning, they often become sources of distraction. For instance, students may use computers to browse social media or play video games instead of focusing on educational content. This diversion from academic activities can lead to a decline in concentration and lower academic performance.

Another contributing factor is the lack of motivation towards studies. Children who do not understand the intrinsic value of education often struggle to stay engaged. This lack of interest may stem from uninspiring teaching methods or an education system that prioritizes rote learning over critical thinking and creativity. Moreover, external factors such as lack of sleep and poor nutrition can severely impact a child's ability to focus. Students who are sleep-deprived or undernourished may experience fatigue and restlessness, making it difficult to concentrate during lessons.

To counteract these challenges, several measures can be implemented. Firstly, schools and parents should set clear guidelines around the use of technology. For example, limiting screen time and blocking access to non-educational websites during study hours can help students focus better on their studies. Additionally, schools should develop engaging curriculums that incorporate interactive and participatory activities, making learning more appealing and relevant to students.

Moreover, the importance of a balanced lifestyle should not be underestimated. Schools can play a vital role by providing awareness programs for students and parents about the importance of adequate sleep and nutrition in maintaining attention spans. Governments can support this initiative by offering nutritious meal plans in schools, especially for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

In conclusion, several factors contribute to students' difficulties in maintaining concentration in school, including technological distractions, lack of motivation, and unhealthy lifestyles. Addressing this issue involves a multi-faceted approach that includes regulating technology use, incorporating engaging teaching methods, and promoting healthy habits. Through concerted efforts from educators, parents, and policymakers, we can enhance children's ability to focus, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes.",8.0
Some people think the government  should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environmental problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is considered by some individuals, that the authorities ought to elevate the prices of fuel, which are used in automobiles, in order to settle the environmental pollution. I partially agree with this statement, because only with increasing the cost of fossil fuel may not solve this problem,  but there are many other options such as the production of more electrically driven vehicles, reduction of the import of fossil fuel-driven automobiles as well as implementing new lawsuits,should be considered  to minimize this environmental crisis.

To begin with, the mission of unfavourable gases such as carbon monoxide from petroleum driven vehicles is a great burden to the environment.These gases cause the 

greenhouse effect which leads to global warming and many more problems. When the cost of fuel is low people tend to purchase more vehicles as their maintenance cost is lower. This can indirectly increase the traffic jam and subsequently elevates  environmental pollution. For example, in countries with low oil prices, the annual sales of automobiles also considerably high. Therefore, by increasing the prices of fossil fuel, consumption will also be reduced and it will indirectly support the environment

However, the elevation of the prices of fossil fuel is not the only answer for the environmental crisis but there are many more logical solutions for this. For instances, the production of  electrically-driven automobiles, as well as reduction of the import of petrol and diesel vehicles can be considered. Moreover, it should be considered to plant more trees in the city areas and this will purify the air and reduce  warming. Empowering citizens by means of protecting their own surrounding is one of the most important  aspects to be considered. As an example, in Sidney,they have reduced the air pollution by  40% with the theme of ""go green "".

In conclusion, It is evident that, although  environmental pollution can be controlled by raising the cost of fuel, there are many other successful methods to solve this global problem.",7,6.5,"### Feedback:

While some posit that raising the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel could be a solution to environmental degradation, I contend that such an approach, though potentially beneficial, is only a partial remedy to a multifaceted problem. Additional strategies such as the promotion of electric vehicles and the reduction of fossil-fuel imports must also play critical roles in solving environmental issues.

Foremost, environmental pollution is significantly exacerbated by emissions from vehicles that burn fossil fuel. Consequently, increasing fuel prices could curtail excessive vehicle usage, thereby reducing vehicular emissions and potentially contributing to decreased pollution levels. By constraining consumption via higher prices, a decline in demand for fossil-fueled transportation may occur, leading people to consider alternative modes of transport such as public transit, cycling, or walking. Moreover, high fuel costs could incentivize a shift towards more efficient and cleaner vehicle technologies. For instance, nations with elevated fuel prices often witness a greater prevalence of energy-efficient vehicles on the road, thus underscoring the potential environmental benefits of this strategy.

However, increasing fuel costs alone is inadequate in addressing the broader environmental crisis. The emergence and promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) constitute a pivotal alternative. By investing in the infrastructure that supports EVs, such as charging stations and battery innovation, governments can foster a significant reduction in reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, manufacturing incentives for domestic production and reduced importation of petrol and diesel vehicles could further galvanize the adoption of lower-carbon emissions alternatives.

Furthermore, it is essential to bolster community-driven ecological initiatives that emphasize the importance of environmental stewardship, such as urban green spaces, conservation programs, and renewable energy projects. These initiatives would not only purify the air but also enhance the overall quality of urban living environments. For instance, Sydney's ""Go Green"" initiative has successfully reduced urban pollution by empowering citizens to actively participate in eco-friendly practices.

In conclusion, while escalating fuel prices can contribute positively towards mitigating environmental pollution, it should operate in conjunction with a sweep of integrated solutions like advancing the electric vehicle sector, implementing progressive import regulations, and championing grassroots ecological projects. This multifaceted approach provides a more holistic solution that underscores the urgency and complexity of the environmental challenges we face today.",8.0
"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion","There is a controversial idea heating a debate over the fact that the major perk of international cooperation is in the environmental protection or is in the business worldwide. From my point of view, the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend for the following reasons.

On the one hand, it cannot be deniable that the environment plays an indispensable role in our daily lives. For the most part, given all nations are inexorably connected financially and politically, wealthier countries may provide poorer countries with ecologically linked aid in order to slow down their unrestrained industrialization. Whatever the outcomes of these activities, collective global efforts have a significant influence on individual consciousness, prompting people to act ecologically responsibly. Furthermore, by exchanging creative ideas, international collaboration might enable scientists to start research seminars. These measures, for instance, will create additional clean energy such as wind and solar in order to address significant environmental issues.

On the other hand, globalization also improves world business to a large extent in terms of the economy. For one, international collaboration will allow various countries to leverage their own advantages in order to maximize their economic growth potential. Taking China as an example, the country's large population draws more labour-intensive businesses such as manufacturing, resulting in more employment possibilities. Additionally, enhanced international trade operations can provide individuals with greater access to high-quality foreign items, thus improving their living standards and sense of satisfaction. On account of that, the growing international collaboration will eventually help the global economy.

To sum up, I believe that whereas international collaboration may result in certain environmental efforts, it is the corporate sector that gains the most from the progress.",8,7.0,"**Task Response:**

Improving coherence, vocabulary range, and grammatical accuracy will help to elevate your essay to the desired band score of 8.0.","International cooperation has become a critical aspect of addressing global challenges, sparking debates on its primary benefits—whether it is more advantageous for environmental protection or world business. While both sectors derive substantial benefits, I contend that the impact on international business has been more pronounced and profound.

On the one hand, environmental protection undeniably garners its share of benefits from international cooperation. The collaborative efforts among nations have led to significant strides in combating global environmental issues such as climate change and pollution. Wealthier nations, with more resources, are able to support developing countries through technological aid and investments aimed at fostering sustainable practices. For instance, international agreements like the Paris Agreement illustrate how collective efforts can guide countries toward reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This collaboration not only aids in mitigating climate issues but also propels innovation and knowledge-sharing amongst scientists worldwide, which is vital for environmental advancement.

On the other hand, the benefits reaped by world business through international cooperation are exceedingly transformative. The phenomenon of globalization has opened vast opportunities for nations to integrate economically, thereby boosting trade and investment flows. Countries can leverage their unique resources and strengths—like China’s massive labor force attracting manufacturing giants—to fuel economic growth. This global network not only fosters economic prosperity but also widens consumer choice and improves living standards by providing access to high-quality international goods and services. Moreover, international trade agreements and partnerships have significantly reduced trade barriers, paving the way for seamless economic exchanges that underpin robust economic development worldwide.

While international collaboration undoubtedly facilitates environmental progress, it is the realm of global business that stands as a testament to the profound economic interconnections and growth stimulated by these collective efforts. It is this economic facet of international cooperation that has brought about far-reaching impacts, fostering wealth creation and advancing global economic stability.

In conclusion, international cooperation plays a pivotal role in addressing both environmental protection and world business. However, I advocate that its predominant benefits are realized in the expansive growth and dynamic evolution of international business, which also often indirectly supports sustainable environmental initiatives through increased resources and innovations. The synergies between these areas highlight the necessity of continued global collaboration for a prosperous and sustainable future.",8.0
