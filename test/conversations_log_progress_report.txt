generator: **Task Response:** 

Your essay effectively addresses both views of the given topic and clearly states your opinion. However, to reach a higher score, you could further develop your argument by providing more specific examples and deeper analysis of how international cooperation impacts both the environment and world business. Additionally, integrating more nuanced discussions about the potential conflicts or synergies between these two areas would add depth to your argument.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

Your essay is organized logically, and you have used cohesive devices to connect ideas within paragraphs. However, improving the transition between paragraphs could further enhance the flow of your essay. When discussing the opposing views, consider summarizing the preceding paragraph briefly before segueing into the next, which will guide the reader smoothly through your argument. 

**Lexical Resource:**

You demonstrate a good range of vocabulary, but there are areas where more precise or varied word choices could be made. Avoid repetition and consider using synonyms or rephrasing ideas. Additionally, try to incorporate more topic-specific vocabulary related to international cooperation, environmental sustainability, and economic development to enrich your essay.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

Your grammatical range is good, and you demonstrate an understanding of complex sentence structures. However, some grammatical inaccuracies detract from your essay, such as "it cannot be deniable" which should be "it cannot be denied". Proofread your essay to correct any minor errors and ensure varied sentence structures are used effectively throughout your writing. 

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Provide more specific examples and evidence to support each view discussed.
2. Enhance paragraph transitions and cohesion by using more sophisticated linking phrases.
3. Expand your use of advanced vocabulary and topic-related terms to add precision and variety to your language.
4. Proofread for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing and practice using a diverse range of sentence structures.

**Overall Summary:**

Your essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the task and presents both views thoughtfully. To achieve a higher score, you should aim to elaborate more on your points with detailed examples and a nuanced analysis. Improving coherence, vocabulary range, and grammatical accuracy will help to elevate your essay to the desired band score of 8.0.
