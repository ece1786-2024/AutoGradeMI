      "  Prompt: Many people use social media to keep in touch with other people and for news events. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\n",
      "  Essay: In the modern era, the masses are frequently using social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube to contact other folks and to keep themselves updated about current affairs around the world. I believe the pros of this phenomenon will outbalance the cons, as we will see in this essay.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, the tendency of making use of social media these days has many advantages for people dwelling on different continents. With aid of these online websites and ,applications one can confabulate with their loved ones residing in some corner of this gigantic world. Now, the public can stay in touch with their families and friends with the snap of their fingers. This idea has lessened the communication barriers and was considered a dream of the past which has now become a stark reality owing to the advancement in science and technology. For instance, people living in an underdeveloped country in Africa like Kenya can talk to their peers living in Canada in North America. Moreover, people who are curious about the current happenings around the globe can get to know news with the effective use of data and information available on the internet. This enhances their knowledge and intellectual development. Likewise, this can also help them to adapt to the fastly transforming world. Hence, social media proves to be beneficial for folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, along with a plethora of vantages, social media has notable disadvantages as well. One of the most considerable negative aspects is that it engenders feelings of jealousy and envy among people. For example, when folks who are not affluent view their peers and colleagues as living in the lap of luxuries, they tend to develop negative sentiments such as resentment and hatred which are detrimental to their mental health. Furthermore, social media is tremendously corrupting day-to-day human interactions by reducing the number of physical interactions in the everyday lives of the masses. Nowadays, people are more inclined to interact with other people using mobile applications and online websites rather than visiting in person as they used to do in the past. This transmutation in social demeanour has negative implications on the traditions and customs of a particular culture. One can see this with the crowd losing their stranglehold on the ethics and values of society. Therefore, the use of social media possesses considerable and noteworthy cons for folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, the usage of the internet has become heavily popular since the dawn of the twenty-first century. The internet is being utilised by the public to check on other folks or to enlighten themselves about news events. The remarkable pros of this trend far outbalance its cons, as were discussed in this essay.\n",

      "  Essay: Nowadays, using social applications in order to communicate with others or update report events becomes widespread among people. While there are some drawbacks associated with using social media, I believe the main benefits are more substantial. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, a primary advantage of using social media is that connections are made effortlessly regardless of the location or time. Hence, it helps many individuals who were immigrated to another country to make a connection with their relatives just by pressing a click. For example, it is so convenient for parents whose children study abroad to make a video call daily. In addition, due to the technological advancements in applications, various information is speared quickly, therefore, anyone can access the latest news. For instance, football fans are able to know the latest live football results on their way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a potential disadvantage of the existence of social media may be that each person would waste a lot of time on these social websites while it could be handled by time management. Also, people are maybe influenced by fake news published on such websites which provides some unreal content. For instance, teenagers are in danger of believing the fake lifestyle is presented by bloggers on Instagram. However, there is actually no evidence to support this view.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, using social media would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, it is positive effects in terms of expanding their relationship and getting the up-to-date data is override the downsides.\n",

      "  Prompt: Many people use social media to keep in touch with other people and for news events. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\n",
      "  Essay: In this day and age, the majority of people use social media to connect with each other and to receive  news. In my opinion, the benefits of using social platforms such as better communication and easy accessibility to news override the drawbacks of distractions and getting misleading information.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, a large number of people use social networks to communicate with one another such as by using What's App or Facebook. This is a much easier and convenient way of having conversations with family members or friends especially when they are living in different cities or countries. For instance, international students can talk to their parents or siblings whenever they want through What's app video calls. Hence, it is extremely beneficial for those who live far away from their loved ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, regarding the news headlines, social platform plays an important role in terms of getting updates. Nowadays, it is not necessary to wait for the newspaper to get  information about what is going on around the globe. As we have online news channels, people can watch the latest stories whenever they want. Thus, the social network helps in keeping people aware of their surroundings every second.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, usage of social media can also have negative impacts such as distraction or wastage of time. Many young people spend extended hours on their mobiles either talking to their peers or chatting in  groups for time pass. Hence, it is highly unproductive for them. Moreover, getting online news can sometimes be misguiding as people can share fake news to gain popularity and it also becomes difficult to distinguish between true and false information. Therefore, the use of social websites can have detrimental effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, social media is a great medium for connecting with people and receiving headlines for many people. In my opinion, the pros of using these online websites such as better communication and easy access to news updates are far better than the cons which include distractability and fake news stories.\n",

      "  Essay: Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.\n",
      "On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.\n",
      "On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?\n",
      "The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.\n",
      "To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits\n",

      "  Essay: Change is considered a positive thing by some people, whilst other would rather have the same routine avoinding any different activities. Hence, it is complicated to agree or disagree with one of these way of thinking, the choice is personal. However, trying something outside of the normal routine could bring improvement in lifes.\n",
      "Change is an important topic in our modern world where everything moves and evolves so quickly and people do not have the time to reflect on the present. Therefore, it is understanding if someone is afraid of it and prefer to have the same habits, spending their life doing the exact same circle of thing week after week. This is call comfort-zone. Everyone aims at it at some point of their life because it is reassuring, easy and releaxing. But does it brings in people's life important events or news? The answer most likely is no. If people do not go out of their comfort-zone, choosing changes over habits, they will never experience something new. In the long run people become unsatisfied, depressed holding negative thoughts and unhappy.\n",
      "On the other side, changes are bringing new scenario in mankind's life that can improve, most of the time, their situation. For instance, when a human-being is frustrated by his/hers job, he/she should try to get a new one. Best case scenario he/she will feel more appriciated by it. The point is that this person has not lost anything by this change, because he/she still have an employment. I strongly believe that changes is a good thing because the way people feel during the process of changing is exciting.\n",
