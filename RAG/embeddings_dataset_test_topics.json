        "prompt": "some people believe that to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. Do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "It is true that most respiratory problems come from pollution. While I accept that to prevent illnesses and diseases authority should focus on reducing pollution, I strongly believe that there are much better ways to keep people being infected. \r\n\r\nAs we live in urbanization, everyone can see construction of premises in every parts of the world, and it has adverse effect for quality of air as well as water contamination. First and foremost, government should reduce construction of buildings in order to improve quality of air and water. Furthermore, poor quality of air and water is a root of diseases and illnesses related to gut and lungs. For example, factories produced toxic gases which eroded ozone layer and pollute atmosphere, if government would able to cut construction of amenities and production of toxins, it helps to enhance our nature and environment, and it lead to change for the better. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there quite a lot of fundamental methods to prevent diseases and illnesses, and improve overall health of citizens. One way is informing individuals about current diseases, and they can take steps. Take as an example Covid-19, this disease emerged on purpose and it is not came from pollution or housing problems. Ministry organization arranged awareness events, and warned about dangers of this disease on social media and on TV such as \"stay at home\" and \"quarantine\". The second way is allocating money on pharmacy and for construction of gyms so that people can take benefits. For instance, by improving vaccines and building fitness areas people can improve their general health.   \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, focusing on decreasing pollution and construction issues is one of the decent methods to prevent spreading of diseases and illnesses, while there are more virtuous ways to keep people being infected.",

        "essay": "There are controversial perspectives heating a debate whether to handle environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity which are caused by improper human activities. While some claim that people don’t have enough time to do anything, the opposite makes a statement that we can enhance the situation by taking a lot of efficacious measures. I would contend that the former is valid to some extent but I consider myself an advocate of the latter. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, some equivalent reasons lead to the claim that it is too late to deal with the undesirable impact on flora and fauna of humans. In the long run, the devastation that meets the ever-growing demand of the greedy human wishes brings unfavourable influences on the deterioration in environmental quality and breed habitat destruction. Hence, a wide range of animals are on the verge of extinction and even die off. For instance, pandas in China are on the brink of extinction due to the shortage of their proper habitat. As a result, a lot of people think that humans can’t do anything to cope with this problem. \r\n\r\nWhile the consequences of inappropriate humans’ activities are widely acknowledged, there are some resolutions to enhance this problem. The Government could invest in constructing an eclectic mix of reservations to create safe habitats and protect endangered species. For instance, Viet Nam’s authorities have made an investment in Cuc Phuong Forest, which houses a wealth of rare animals. Thus, it is not too late to find a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although some people believe humans couldn’t resolve the consequences of their activities on the environment, I think humans could take measures to improve environmental quality and biodiversity.",

        "essay": "In recent days, a topic has aroused heated debate in society about whether modern technology has made life more complicated. Some people think that if we don't use technology, our life might be easier and simpler. In my opinion, this is a complete pipe dream.\r\n\r\nTechnology is certainly not the real reason for complicating human life, but it is the most effective way to make it less complicated. For those who view technological improvement in a misunderstood way, the emergence of various high-tech products has made our lives unnecessarily complicated, and we have to spend time learning new technologies. Our brains make it impossible for us to do things easily, but we are confused by appearances and blame it all on the development of technology. Human civilization forces our lives to be complicated. No matter how technologically developed we are, we have to deal with overpopulation, resource shortages, or environmental pressures and figure out ways to solve them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are now so used to relying on modern technology that I can't imagine how we and our descendants would struggle in a world without modern transportation, tall buildings, or communication apps. Despite their flaws, they are the most suitable solutions ever conceived of for all the current problems that human beings face while going through an increasing population society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is humanity and global development that compel our lives to become more complex, while technology suffers the fate of simplifying them. Therefore, reducing our reliance on technology in order to achieve an unrealistically simple life is unreasonable.",

        "prompt": "The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Housing shortage in cosmopolitan cities can be attributed to two main factors: insufficient supply of residentials areas and rapid surge of population. The government, having the highest authority, has a pivotal role in regulating supply of houses to citizens. Thus, I firmly believe it is only through government led movement that alleviation of the problem could be realised.\r\n\r\nSome may propose that land developers and citizens have a role in aggravating the housing problems: developers can accelerate the process of building housing estates, while citizens can move to areas further away from city centre to reduce the congestion. Of course, these would rely on their conscience, which is often lacking. Who wouldn’t want to live in the proximity of their workplace or school, with all the shops and daily necessities in place? My friend, for instance, prefered to live in Sydney in a tiny flat as she felt it was extremely convenient, rather than go back to suburban areas which was remote and isolated. With the government’s policy in place, giving monetary incentives or welfare rewards to those who comply with increasing residential supply, the scheme would be much more efficient.\r\n\r\nIt is crystal clear that the government has the highest power to enact changes in society. They can design policies to ensure adequate supply of land is provided for residential use, as well as putting a limit to the population rise, therefore reaching a balance between man and space. Singapore is a glaring example, where the authorities have put together reasonably priced and spacious public housing estates for its citizens in the past decades, relieving the pressure on living space. Hong Kong, on the contrary, without such large scale public housing plans in place, finds itself constantly lacking in quality apartments to house the needy. \r\n\r\nWithout the officials led change, it is extremely difficult and inefficient to ease the pressure on housing supply. Therefore, in my opinion, government support and action is the only way out for the paucity of living areas in large urban areas.",

        "essay": "In recent times, the development in the field of robotics has increased rapidly and its prevalence can be noticed in many places. Many believe robots are crucial for human development whereas some argue they have a negative effect on society. This essay would discuss both  views with empirical evidence and conclude with my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, artificial intelligence is one of the greatest milestones achieved by humans. They can be used to study places which are inaccessible to humans. For instance, the world-renowned rover Curiosity, was sent to Mars for a detailed analysis of the planet's features. Without robotic technology, it would take another decade to achieve this feat. Hence, this technology plays a vital role in the development of mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, robotic machines have replaced men in many jobs. For instance, in many food and packaging industries, programmed machines are used as they are more efficient and fast when compared to a worker. Furthermore, a robot can work for long hours without any breaks, thus increasing in productivity of a company. This scenario can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate causing a detrimental effect on  society.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, robots have a pivotal role in  future development and the need for them is inevitable. Although this development has a downside, considering the future technological advancement, robotic science and technology are essential to achieve it.",

        "essay": "In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.\r\nMainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.\r\nNevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.\r\nFinally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",

        "essay": "Many people argue that historical artefacts and objects should be returned to their authentic owners. Although this might be ethical, I strongly disagree with this and think that this may bring ruin the peace and take away the pride of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the return of artefacts will bring conflicts between the countries. As a matter of fact, during the ancient time, the world was geographically different to what it is now. Therefore, the object  conquered from one kingdom may  now be separate countries. Furthermore, it would be a challenge to find its original owner. For example, Kohinoor was taken by the British when India and Pakistan were one. Recently when it was demanded to get the Kohinoor diamond back, the countries had an argument over the original owner, as Kohinoor, was the possession of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who ruled the Punjab kingdom which is now in India as well as Pakistan. Hence, the return of historical items can disrupt world peace.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these artefacts are the pride of the countries who possess them now. These items signify the sacrifices made by the Martyrs and the historic power of the nation. In historic times,  war and power decided who would rule and own, although, the conquerors might not be the original owners. They possess these gaining strength and losing armies. For example, during colonisation, the British took some artefacts from India and it was possible only because of their power. Therefore, pride and historical contributions should be respected and the countries should not give back the artefacts they now possess.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in order to maintain world peace and devote respect to historical events, the artefacts should remain where they are now.",

        "essay": "In contemporary society, some schools removed abilities such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork because they believe that these subjects should not be learned at school as it is better to learn these from family and peers. Therefore, some think that schools should pay attention to studying academics so that students can succeed and pass examinations. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, advocates of this proposition believe that it is beneficial for students if institutions focus on curriculums. There is no denying that academic knowledge is important to children to apply for jobs in the future. For example, some positions in a company such as manager, analyst, and executive have to use academic knowledge rather than professional skills. Moreover, when kids learn about physical abilities like woodwork in their free time with their friends or family, they can develop relationships through  cooperation. As a result, institutions remove vocational subjects in order to give more time to learn for students.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who argue this idea think that schools should not decrease the time the educating vocational curricula. It is obvious that when students exceed focus on academic study, they can get a street which makes it impossible to carry. For instance, when some students do not pass the exam, they may get depressed. Furthermore, some companies need people who have  professional abilities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, schools should not teach capacities like dressmaking but should encourage students to be educated in academic subjects so as to succeed. In my view, I strongly agree with this issue because academic subjects are too easy to find work.",

        "prompt": "Scientists tell us that some activities are good for health and others are bad. Despite knowing that, millions of people still continue doing unhealthy activities. What are the causes and what are the solutions for this",
        "essay": "In modern society, the consequences of unhealthy lifestyles are warned by several experts. Although people are aware of health importance, they find it difficult to stop doing unhealthy activities which leads to a higher risk of health problems and serious living effects. This essay will discuss several causes and suggest some solutions to tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nThere are different reasons to explain this problem. This can be, firstly, explained by the fact that people are too engrossed in work to forget how important health is. Many adults not only work eight hours per day, but also they continue to do other part-time jobs with a stable income desire. Therefore, they have trouble balancing work and personal activities. Sometimes, addressing big workload requirements leaves them with hardly any choice but to do unsound activities, such as an irregular sleep cycle and erratic eating habits. Secondly, once people are addicted to unhealthy habits, it is difficult for them to regulate. For example, people with smoking habits cannot reduce their dependence on cigarettes due to their high addictiveness. Besides, it is also unable to bring people with a sedentary lifestyle to be more active because doing exercises or other physical activities seems to be bothering them.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, solutions are presented suggested as below. One of which is that a healthy lifestyle should be promoted in the working and life environment. For instance, educating and self-educating about the influences of lifestyle should be stimulated by launching online competitions involving healthy activities. In addition, employees should apply smart tools to manage and build scientific working schedules. Nonetheless, companies are suggested to raise bonuses or support for difficult family circumstances so that they can feel less pressure to have better incomes. On the other hand, an unhealthy lifestyle should be strictly criticized in the media as a method to raise awareness of its consequences. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are indeed various causes regarding unsound activities, yet, they can be solved once measures are enlisted imperatively.",

        "essay": "As the impact of issues caused by human activities such as deforestation has become palpable to a great number of flora and fauna, species protection has become one of humanity's chief objectives in the 21st century. Although it is believed that tackling this issue would be pointless as no solutions will prove to be effective, I strongly opine that several feasible measures can be taken to alleviate it. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, that reversing the damage done to flora and fauna is a massive, impractical undertaking is justifiable to a certain extent. Most of the ongoing problems are the direct result of deforestation and pollution caused by non-stop economic activities. On such grounds, given the context of an increasing global population and the higher demands for land and products, in no way can humankind consent to reduce their economic growth. Not to mention that the extinction process is still happening at an incredibly quick rate, causing disruptions to the natural food chains, accelerating the extinction rate of other living creatures due to the domino effects, and eventually making it even faster than the speed of human interventions. Therefore, it would be impossible to slacken such a process. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while a complete restoration of past conditions is unfeasible, measures can be taken to mitigate threats to animals and plants. First and foremost, more wildlife reserves and sanctuaries can be constructed in order to provide protection from illegal hunting. This can also act as a gene pool for scientists to preserve the engendered being' genetic material, lessening the possibility of complete extinction. Additionally, when the existence of endangered creatures is threatened, being able to isolate healthy, unaffected individuals for breeding is now getting an additional technological boost. For example, with the advent of technology, scientists are now using high-tech gene sequencing machines in an all-out effort to save the Tasmanian devil from an infectious disease that is threatening to wipe out the species. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the seemingly impossible reality of conserving natural creatures, I firmly believe that it is still plausible to compensate for the environmental damage and preserve the existence of plants and animals.",

Day by day, the ice where in the North is decreasing, also the temparature is rising. Over the years, all the scientists who research about methodology and environment sign to eliminate climate change. Obviously, the measurements cannot utilize to  the world a better place. For example, in a small town, all the cars and production centres have restricted since 2018 in my city. However, air pollution or other healing process in the environment has not appeared anymore. That is to say, the authorities should manage with more effective precautions. I will agree that if the people take care about climate change and solutions, all humanity will survive without any concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another belief supports living with the climate change may be supply benefits to us. Therefore, everybody can focus and adapt to new temperature or other change. Although, when it has not inhibited, it has been never ended.

This essay will discuss both viewpoints. My inclination is elaborated further in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the argument, there is a community that argues adding skill-based subjects will help develop skills like motor ability, hand and eye coordination, creativity and many more. Moreover, engaging sophomores in crafts will enhance their learning ability, which brings a sense of achievement on completion of tasks, adding the psychological development. It also helps pupils to learn about the culture and built belongingness towards the nation. Hence, further building responsible citizens of the country.

Therefore, this essay will explicate some key reasons why environment is polluted and will suggest a range of possible measures that can be taken to improve/change the situation and highlight probable knock-on effects of polluted environment. \r\n\r\nA wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that lot of companies did not treat the drainage properly. The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because the modern drainage was not installed by this company, and they threw all the industrial waste into the water causing water pollution in this area. Thus, it is no surprise to see that there is rise in producing consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.\r\n\r\nImprovements to polluted environment can be achieved in a variety of ways, strict management of dischargement is one of the most favourable and note-worthy choice. To elaborate, government should be controlled strictly and only allow which company to have environmental protection standards so they never can throw their trash which are harmful to the environment into the atmosphere. This can improve the situation by controlling the amount of industrial waste to environment and encouraging recycle waste.

Some people opine that government should provide financial assistance to the elderly people, whereas others pursue that they should take responsibility for themselves.The ensuing paragraphs analyse both these views in a detailed way to air my opinion. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, government should take adequate measures to support retired people because they have rendered service for a time period. To make it more clear, \r\nMany of the retired people are receiving \r\npensions from their previous work in different sectors such as government employees, soldiers and  teachers, and it is considered as their right.There are retired people who were not able to establish financial security at their old age and rendering care to these people is a government responsibility in order to build a social democracy. Furthermore , it is their right to have some financial support as they had paid their taxes throughout their lives. So they have to take some of their money back when they need it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,people earn and save money for their future needs and old people take responsibility themselves.The line of reasoning is very clear that a prudent person would have some savings for his old years and thus it is also an individual’s responsibility to save for their future need. Moreover, the children should always be ready to take care of their elder parents. For instance, in Indian culture, the elderly people are well supported by their family members, especially their children. Hence, why a part of the society not support the idea of government to help retired ones is clearly justified. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the above discussion clearly specifies the fact that  governments should take the responsibility of providing senior citizens with all their financial needs as part of  ensuring their well-being and at the same time it is an individual's responsibility to save money for their future  time  and their children  have some responsibilities as well.So, in my opinion, government should take the measures for retired people is the better option.",

While it is a priority to educate youth, in my opinion, teaching adults is equally crucial and I agree that governments should invest in this.\r\n\r\neducation youngsters would directly affect a country's development. They are the population who should bring a prosperous future to their nation. They are likely to have unique ideas that could revolutionize human life, but without learning state-of-the-art knowledge that would be impossible. For example, technological advancement, especially in the field of artificial intelligence, could not be achieved if people were not literate. Therefore, more progress and development may only be feasible if governments prioritize educating young adults.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that literacy is vital for everyone in society, including adults. Firstly, they are role models for children and youth. If they are not educated, they probably could not bring a literate generation and this possibly has a negative impact on the nation's future. Secondly, literacy is an aspect that is considered as a development of a country. Since  adults contribute a high percentage of the population, the nation will not be considered a developed and educated one if this majority is not taught. Finally, they need to be literate to live in the modern world, where everything is dependent on technology and human-machine interaction.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is fundamental to have a majority of well-educated individuals in society and governments should not only concern with young people's education but also allocate a specific budget to literate adults who still cannot even read and write. It seems to me that these two groups are equally important to be educated.",

        "prompt": "Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement.",
        "essay": "It can be seen that technologies are consistently improving, especially in today's technology-focused world, therefore numerous persons believe that all employees can be done by those things. However, it seems to me that statement is not entirely straightforward, and I will explain why in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are several careers that cannot be done by AI such as doctors, civil engineers, actors and so on. For example, the process of surgical operations has countless-complicated functions, which means that these steps are very difficult to be exact for a robot. Another argument is that a song such as romance that is sung by a human couple concludes not only a sweet voice but also a contented feeling. Nevertheless, even a machine can produce a piece of music, it does not include the emotions and feelings that are the main strength of the music. In addition, generally speaking,  artificial intelligence can do countless factors such as packaging, labelling and cleaning because it has  systematic functions. In spite of this, instead of a job, it cannot employ the other jobs. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is true that AI can serve the works without taking the leisure time so they can perform their own duties as fast as possible. Moreover, they can do homework when the individuals do not have enough moment. For instance, they can wash plates, spoons and forks, next they can also clean the floor with a vacuum cleaner.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it is sensible to conclude that a robotics tool can consistently make various tasks, although, this still has the businesses that cannot do by this such as entertainment industries, medical and dental occupations and painting strategies.",

In this essay I am going to discuss this view and give my opinion. \r\n\r\nThere are many people believe that the news is important and we have to read it. First, they think the news shows the new of the world. For example, some people live abroad and they can know everything happens in their country by the news. Second, the news helps individuals to evolve their cultures. To illustrate, some people like to know a new culture when they watch about this culture in the TV. Finally, the news is the best way to recognize anything around the world. These are some reasons why people think the news is powerful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some public think the news has no connection to people`s lives. In addition, they see a lot of news which are a waste of time. In fact, this is because news depends on lies and controversies. Moreover, the news relies on the fakes. Because of this, people do not want to lose their time to read the news or watch television. These are some beliefs, why individual do not like the news. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, this essay has discussed some views about the news.

        "essay": "It has been frequently argued that urban areas ought to keep space for playgrounds or public parks. I completely agree with the statement as it could bring ample benefits to the life of dwellers and the same would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, if all cities would construct beautiful gardens, specifically for each area, it could have the following benefits. Initially, parks or grounds, which  have been maintained properly with flowers and trees would provide the best view. Consequently, they could visit frequently there and get relief from mental stress and fatigue for the whole day. Besides,  these places are merely sources of fresh air in developed areas as most of these areas are covered with buildings and roads. For instance, the harmful gases or the pollution exhausted by vehicles could be purified by planting trees since they consume carbon dioxide and exhale fresh air that is oxygen in surroundings, subsequently, inhabitants could consume fresh air.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, human beings could utilise public parks for spending quality time and it is useful for them in plenty of ways. Firstly, children could play outdoor sports on a daily basis and it would provide a plethora of advantages to their health. For example, in concrete areas, they could barely enjoy as they have to play video games or operate electronic gadgets in their  spare time, whereas, open places would encourage them to play. Apart from this, adults could go for morning and evening walks, therefore, they could get relief from health problems.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if councils would provide space and build gardens for dwellers, it could provide them with many benefits and they could lead a healthy and happy life.",

        "essay": "In our modern society, with its technocratic scope, less and less people are concerned about their mental health and stability. This has resulted in individuals claiming that the arts are a waste of time and should be removed from the school's curriculum. I personally feel that, their importance is significant. In this write up I will attempt to debate both views.\r\n\r\nFirstly, on the one hand, the arts are immensely important. They give students the opportunity to think in an original and different way, while giving colour to their reality. Music and other forms of art, uplift individuals and calm them down. For example, from my own experience playing the trumpet, it relieves me from my everyday stress and worries. Lastly, they bring up skill and traits we never knew we had and make us more complete individuals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, secondly, they take time off the school's schedule that could otherwise be used for math and other principal sciences. The need for these is ever increasing in order to comply with the demands of our society. To illustrate, a study carried out by the University of Cambridge showed that, more than 60% of jobs require an adequate knowledge of math or statistics. Finally, while sciences brighten your knowledge they do not cultivate your thoughts, which can lead to uncertain individuals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the arts should be an important part of the educational curriculum. And also it's my firm belief that more creative activities should be implemented in order for more children to profit off this.",

        "essay": "According to some point of view Nowadays obesity is one of the most widespread problems in the world, which can be solved, according to some human propositions, by establishing high prices on processing foods. I  disagree with this suggestion and this essay will discuss the phenomena of obesity.\r\n\r\nThe main reason which leads to appearing the above-mentioned problem is not only processing foods, but a non-healthy and sedentary lifestyle in general and following measures can probably settle this. The decrease in processing food consumption can be achieved through the prohibition of fast-food advertisements. That kind of advertising appears in movies, internet games, mobile apps, sports games, tabloids, therefore it can be seen in almost every crowded place. People, especially youth, can fall under the influence of that propaganda. If the government made the prohibition law for that kind of advertisement, the rise of usage of fast foods would stop. At the same time, as the second measure, governments can impose an excise tax on fattening foods. This measure perhaps may reduce the number of fast-food restaurants and, by decreasing the access to that kind of foods, can decline its consumption. It is also important to promote a healthy lifestyle, through open areas with different free sports facilities, introduce free courts for sporting games, organizing sporting events.\r\n\r\nEvery person, in a different part of their life, may need access to convenient and inexpensive foods. For instance, students, individuals who come from other cities and others, who do not have time or opportunity to prepare meals. Taking into account, that increasing prices of processing foods might not bring the results, although can lead to mentioned inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAccording to the essay, several methods, which can help to solve the problem of human overweight do exist. In my opinion, by raising the price on special types of foods would not be able to solve the global problem of obesity.",

        "essay": "A controversial discussion point is whether enrolling in a university or getting a job immediately after graduating from  high school is the best way to a successful career. While the author believes that studying  at a university or college is better, some people have the opposite point of view.\r\n\r\nIt should be acknowledged that to pursue a prospective career path, an enduring level of knowledge is immensely important. By enrolling in a college, students can obtain even professional skills and knowledge relating to their dream job. Thus, stand a greater chance of landing a well-paid occupation. For example, a study in the USA in 2000 revealed that more than 60% of employees have at least studied in an academy.\r\n\r\nHowever, some people hold the opposite view which is the better way to have a successful career is to enter the workforce immediately after high school. First, this help students enrich life experiences as well as occupational skills and also, taking a job early enables students to be more mature and independent in their life. Secondly, since pupils have a chance to interact with the public, they are capable of expanding their relationships with people around them. This will be a great thing as they can rely on these relationships to achieve higher positions in their workplace.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of the author that having  employment right after high school can bring some benefits, notwithstanding, to achieve a higher position, a great level of knowledge is immensely necessary. Because higher standing requires a better in-depth understanding of the occupation ,especially researchers and analysts. This can be obtained through lessons, courses and experiments in university or college.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, without studying in an academy, it is hard to obtain  prospective employment only by entering the workforce. I believe that this point of view should be considered carefully and the essay has provided sufficient reasons for this statement.",

In this ,essay we will discuss both the sides of having  art subject for children and also my opinion.\r\n\r\nArt is a prosperous way to describe our feelings. A report says that 80 per cent of people when drawing some piece of art, so they are trying to show their inner feeling whether it be happiness or sorrow. For example,  A friend of mine was interested in drawing paintings and I used to ask him the reason to draw painting. Therefore, one  day he told me that he try to narrate his inner pain by drawing and painting.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is also true that with the advent of technology people have started focusing more on the development of new technologies. Parents find subjects like arts useless because they know that technology is flourishing and so they also know that their kids can have a good future if they focused more on technology rather than the arts. To illustrate, when I was doing my bachelor of technology the total number of seats available was only 120 in every field. So, in information technology and computer science there was not a single seat of admission left whereas the other branch was approx half vacant. Parents usually say if they studied art subject they will not be able to concentrate on technological subjects.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I think it is very much necessary to have art subject as it makes child body and mind relax. To conclude I would say students feel energetic by doing painting while after looking at today scenario it is also necessary to have these subject classes once  a week as gaining knowledge in the technology field is foremost.",

I strongly agree with the above statement and my justification will come in further paragraphs along with some relative examples.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, there are several reasons why human beings not need to pay taxes. Firstly, they put extra hours and hardwork to earn money hence they should keep all the money for their better future. For instance, sometimes any misshepling occure that time they easily used their saving for any medical emergency and many more.

This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.\r\n\tOn the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources.

As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals.

Some group of people believes that students have to study in universities because this is the only way to get success in society. Whereas few people told that students have to start their appointment after completing their school. I will discuss both views in a further essay and give my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is irrefutable fact that as long you do course your carrier will be bright in future. I strongly agree with the notion because in this technological,world we required a different kind of knowledge to get some information and we can only get it from doing a further class. Moreover, if an individual completes college with a good rank then they will definitely get a good placement with high wages which is more useful for them to survive their life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people told that there is not only a waste of time to get an education from a university but also a waste of money. Those communities believe that their children are not doing study well and bunk the class. So it is better to start a job in a specific field and it also provides some financial relief in their house. For example, one research conducted by The Times of India found that 70% of students  started jobs due to the requirement of funds in the house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my opinion that I believe that students have to complete their college because they will not only get a good education in the universities but they also get different types of experience such as how to manage funds, how to coordinate with other crowds which are very useful for their remaining life.",

        "essay": "Teenagers must study but they also have  free time they can spend for the benefit of the society. Some people say that unpaid community work is a good choice for pupils to test their skills and to help others. I suppose that this kind of teen labour shall be strictly regulated for it not to harm anyone. This essay will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of community work for minors.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, community work can teach responsibility and empathy. For example, school students may take care of ill pets in the shelter. The animal shelter experience is useful to understand the needs of other creatures without words and to become patient and kind. Moreover, such projects as pet adoption centres often survive without the financial support of a state so it is good for them to involve unpaid employees. Hence volunteering is able to make the world better.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main purpose of teenagers is to study. That is why many legislations encompass rules which restrict the labour of underage workers, namely the prohibition to work more than 6 hours for persons between 14 and 16. Although sometimes community work may even help to improve grades there is no doubt that boys and girls between 12 and 18 get tired more easily than grown-ups which can result in failure to fulfil basic obligations. Besides, they do not know how to protect their rights in case employers exploit them. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all the disadvantages before letting pupils work for free.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, school students should volunteer for the common good and  self-improvement but under conditions stipulated in the law. It is recommended that a state controls teen labour.",

Many people believe this will have a positive impact on these youngsters and the public at large. I completely agree with the statement above and this essay will highlight some of the important merits of this service.\r\n\r\nBy participating in free work for the community, there are various pros to what these teens can achieve from the exercise. For example, their involvement in the neighbourhood clinic can help build their future ambition in this field of work. Consequently, these lads might eventually want to become a surgeon or nurses as they might get exposed to certain health problems that will encourage them to be better at life. As a result, they find a way of giving back what they learnt to \r\n\r\nthe society by becoming a productive citizen.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, having Young lads engage in volunteer services will help keep them away from a life of crime as they have less time to engage in it. For instance, peer pressure has a significant role to play in a young child’s life. In fact, having friends who participate in these activities will in turn help burst their willingness to participate and as such, their orientation will improve as they eventually become responsible and disciplined adults in the nearest future. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is crystal clear that engaging in  volunteer community services has a positive impact on teenagers by enriching some qualities that they might not have gotten by staying at home.

In this essay, I will elaborate on why I believe that this is a positive development and outline main benefits.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the opportunity to attend lectures on the internet platforms istead of inperosn, contributes to a solution of the main struggle of nearly every student, financial strain. Namely, having classes on campus is followed by few costs which can be easily avoided by simply staying at home, including all transportation fees and expenses of eating out for instance. This may seem insignificant, but when compounded, it usually cause headaches to both, pupils and families. Hence, without a need to visit a university, student might save a considerable sum of money on a yearly basis. \r\n\r\nMoreover, attending educational institution is frequently highly time consuming, especially for the learners who live further away. Not only the transportation can take you a lot of time but it leaves you  nearly none freedom for the time management. In other words, opportunity to organise your day to a little detail, including meal breaks, lecture time or leisure activities, leads to higher productivity and consequently more free time. Therefore, the less strict the time-table is, the more enjoyable the individual will find studying.\r\n\r\nIn conlusion,  I am of the opinion that off campus education is strongly advantageous and thus the positive development.

Although there are convincing statements  on both sides, i believe that we still have to tackle this issue.\r\n\r\nOne of the main causes of temperature change is global warming. If both the government and people can take reasonable actions, this can be well controlled. For instance, the government can stop the generation of power from fossil fuels, which causes the emission of carbon and can be detrimental to the society. Also, the government can implement green taxes on industries that emit carbon-di-oxide, and invest in other renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Furthermore, individuals can try to limit their carbon footprint by flying less and using public transport.\r\n\r\nTrying to live with climate revolution is a very dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming, the polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. Provided that there is an increase water sea level, natural disasters like flooding and drought are likely to occur. As a result, this will make people lose their homes and perhaps migrate to another country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  weather diversity is becoming a pressing issue, I reiterate my opinion that there are different ways of tackling this problem by creating a new source of power and using less vehicles.

        "essay": "Nowadays the percentage of people, which want to have a child in their middle age is rising. This essay will discuss the reasons why it occurs and will provide arguments for its advantages and disadvantages.\r\nIn my opinion the rise in the rate of people, who decided to have children in their later age than in the past is due to reason: desire to build stronger financial bases for future family. More young people realize that to carry about children and provide them with all necessary needs are not cheap and all this thing requires a sustainable financial source. That is why a lot of people try firstly to build a successful career, which results in forming a strong financial basement and only after that to plan a child. For example, a lot of Russian survey's results demonstrate that the lack of enough money is the main reason of delaying of planning children. \r\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of this statement. From one point of view, it is better to have a child in more wealthy conditions because all our and child's demand would be satisfied. For instance, to take care of children and provide them with a quality access to all necessary services, which impact on their development, require a lot of financial investments. \r\nOn the other hand it is bad to have children in later age because of physical opportunities  for mothers. Childbirth is a strong stress on women's health and according to evolution from year to year women's body does not become younger and stronger for bringing a birth of a baby. For instance, there are many cases when children of middle aged women were born with some physical disabilities. \r\nIn my personal opinion, advantages of late planning kid outweigh disadvantages due to modern human demands. Moreover, medicine's achievements allow women to solve their physical problems. \r\nSummarizing the ideas mentioned above it has become clear that there are advantages and disadvantages of late planning children  and the main reason of this is desired to make a confident financial base.",

This essay will discuss both sides, my opinion followed by a comprehensive conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo commence, many would argue that we are too late to protect these species as we have already lost two-thirds of the plants and animals. For example, the population of vultures and leopards is such that it seems impossible to conserve them. Also, many would claim that human development is more important than protecting natural habitats like forests. As a result, we are experiencing further loss of such organisms.

        "essay": "In today's society, cooperation is considered a fundamental value, reason why needs to be taught since at a young age. However, it is argued that the best path to promote teamwork is through sports at school. I fully agree with who believes that to reach an higher standard of partnership is necessary employing physical activities.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, competitive games are not the soley way to show the effects of collaboration. In fact, different methods can be apply, such as partner pupils up for a project or assignement, so that they will promptly realized that working together will enhance their knowledge, helping them to achieve the common aim. They will soon understand that each of them brings various strength in to the group that should be utilized at their adavantage. Although assigning students group homework, which tests their cooperational skills and illustrates them the benefit gained out of it, I think that teaching this value through corporal excercises is more effective.\r\n\r\nThe results of any kind of sports, from a single player to couple or vast team, are depending on a main attitude: collaboration. If scholars are open to partner with coach or colleague, greater outcome can be obtained. Physical activities offer a deep insight on how working together can help to ease the attainment of goals, sustaining and pushing each other for improvement. Furthermore, it teaches the lesson of not giving up, due to the responsabilities and duty toward their peers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, more path can be followed to show students how to cooperate, but I firmly believe that the best method is through team sports at school.",

        "essay": "People have different views about the best way to successful career is continuing to study at academic institutions or getting a job. While having a job after school would bring some benefits, I believe that it is better to go to college or university.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are some advantages to having a job straight after completing course in schools. Firstly, school leavers could start earning money early ; therefore, they are able to pay the cost of living in their lives. Secondly, some individuals would like to follow their passion, and they want to put the knowledge gained during their studies into pratices. For example, Bill Gate, one of the richest man in the world, decided to drop out of Havard universtiy when he find the opportunity with computer softwares. Finally, if students word hard after finishing school, they are ability to move up the career ladder in the near future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would argue that it is beneficial for students to choose university to enhance their knowledge. Nowadays some companies require academic qualifications in order to work effectively, such as hospitals and banks. Also, getting a excellent degree could help student to have the promotion prospects. In addition, studying in universities might give to teenagers to have strong relationships. As a result, usually do they have an opportunity to reach their achivement in live.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that students should continue to study in universities for successful careers instead of working straight when they finish schools.\r\n",

        "essay": "Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.\r\nOn the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.\r\nOn the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.\r\nIn conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",

        "essay": "Environment issue is a major problem in today’s society.  Some strongly believed that, high price of fuel is only option to save environment conditions.  In my opinion, it may help to some extent; however, this is not only a solution to tackle this problem.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, increasing the price of petrol can help reduce the environmental pollution to some degree. In other words, excessive use of cars emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment. If the cost of petrol and diesel hiked, individuals are starting to use their cars less and this, in turn, can positive development. However, the change in fuel cost will not stop the environment pollution. Beside the vary fuel price can also affect poor and middle-class families.\r\n\r\nOn the other sides, governments take several steps to resolve these problems. An effective way to control pollution, the government should invest in renewable energy like wind, tide and solar rather than non-renewable sources like coal, diesel and other gasoline products. For example, solar power is in Unite sates has proven it is efficient in power generation. Second, by improving public transportation and reducing the cost of travelling, government can encourage more people to use public transport; this practice can help to clean environment as well as traffic conjunction. In additions, they should ban some materials like plastic which is highly used in our day to day lives. The more using of Non-bio-degradable materials makes climate condition more worst.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the hike in gas price is not the only option to control environment condition.

The essay will explain why and how the public investigates their own houses.\r\n\r\nRegarding the reasons why society wants to know more about the past of their places, there are several possible reasons such as curiosity and finance. First, some people may only be curious about whether there are any interesting stories behind their building, especially for an old and mysterious building. This behaviour has also happened many times at the beginning of the movies too, where the lead characters start their adventure when discovering a hidden attic or storage in their dwelling. Second, financial can become a factor because by knowing the current building more, people can plan more efficient on how to improve their accommodation. For example, by knowing the strength of the building's foundation, the family can decide whether it is safe to build another floor or not.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the ways men and women research the building where they live, there are two possible options. Starting it by observing is one of the  fastest and easiest ways that the residents can do since there is no preparation is needed. However, there is a drawback since this way is limited to the observer's knowledge, so the information that can be gained is also limited. Next, people can gain information from other families like neighbours. In smaller areas where each family live close to each other, they may know more about the situations in each home too. For instance, many neighbours know if there was any suicide that happened in the building or why the previous owner sold it (as the previous owner may talk previously like moving out or bankrupt).\r\n\r\nTo conclude, knowing the background of the building has been more popular for curiosity or financial reasons and it can be known by observing or asking other neighbours.",

It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.\r\nSome people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.\r\nIt is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.\r\nIn summary, we can learn a lot from history and history is important for human development.",

Consequently, the crowd would be interested in finding the truth about their home before they step in.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.",

At the same time, however, there is some uncertainty as to the causes of this trend and its measures. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the debate to seek a conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, consumers tend to buy an excess quantity of items even when they already have enough to use and throw them away after years of hoarding. For instance, some young girls hoard facial masks and lipsticks, but never use them before treating them as rubbish. Moreover, by producing various goods that can be consumed the manufacturers can profit significantly. However, in the process of making the products there are chemicals emitting into the air and rivers which will pollute the atmosphere and water. In addition, as the technology of inventing and updating electronic devices is improving, digital items are updated more and more quickly which cost numerous natural resources.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some steps that can be taken to resolve these problems. Advertisings which persuade customers to buy things should be under supervision. Also, governments can broadcast some videos against consumerism, raising the awareness of the public. Furthermore, laws and regulations on the manufacturing industry should be created to protect the environment.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is no doubt that producing consumer items can bring serious ecological damages. At the same time, however, governments, manufacturers and advertising enterprises can take measures to reduce the influences. In the final analysis, one can conclude that governments bear the main responsibility to protect the environment in this kind of production.",

Moreover, hiking the price of the fuel will affect weak and middle class family.Yet, another compelling reason against the statement is that, people can handle and lessen environmental problems by some better quick fixes. A good illustration of this is, using renewable sources instead of non-renewable resources would be an appropriate way. For example, solar power is an efficient substitute for gasoline.Furthermore, improving public transportation and encourage people to use them is another practical solution.To put it differently, the capture attraction of people to travel by bus or train.For instance, encourage people to adopt public transportation by decreasing the cost of tickets.Not only will it eliminate air pollution, but it also helps to reduce traffic jam.To conclude, considering the points discussed above, the most rational conclusion to be drawn is that, the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem.

While it is possible that all menial jobs eventually be done by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by the people.\r\n\r\nRobots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. The supermarkets, in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holiday and holiday pay.

Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly likely that robots will end most of the human employment.

While dealing with people, youngsters get to listen to the needs of the community which will help build their skills to communicate and socialize with them. Many students pay loads of money to get educated and learn these skills, but with unpaid community work, these skills can be learnt for free. For example, a survey conducted by the UK university shows that more than 85% of the children who take part in any unpaid social work usually carry better social skills than those who do not.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that it will help society in numerous ways.

For example, according to a report by the New York Time in 2018, 80% of New York residents would google in the first place when they face difficulties, and 87% of them do not need extra helps after searching for the solutions. Besides, online service such as online shopping and online booking makes asking help from a less necessary option. Thus, people nowadays apparently are independent of others.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the post-industrial society, jobs are categorized as detailed as they can. As a result, every section of  society tightly links with each other. In other words, people cannot completely be independent. For instance, a survey by Harvard University in 2016 represented that 98% of meals which were self-cooked on American's tables depended on food-producing chains, which included planting, transporting, packing, and selling. Nevertheless, even those who produce food by their own efforts have to buy seeds, fertilizers and planting equipment from others. Therefore, I believe that people considerably rely on others.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, due to the ascend and development of technology, people consider they are independent. Nonetheless, in my mind, because of the high-level specialization in contemporary society, people are heavily reliant on others.",

        "prompt": "More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that the price increase of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Obesity rates have been steadily rising, raising concerns about the overall well-being of individuals. To address this issue, some argue that increasing the price of high-calorie foods would provide a solution. I believe that this approach is insufficient at best.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, raising the price of fattening foods can certainly produce a positive impact on curbing the obesity epidemic. It is quite obvious that excessive consumption is mostly traced back to the availability and affordability of unhealthy food options. By increasing the price of these items, individuals will be deterred from frequent purchases, as higher price generally leads to reduced demand. Consequently, this measure may encourage people to make healthier food choices, which usually include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats, leading to a reduction in obesity rates. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are limitations to the effectiveness of price manipulation, mostly concerning the equality in its application. The socio-economic factor plays a crucial role here, as individuals from lower-income backgrounds may still find it challenging to afford healthier alternatives. Additionally, price increase alone fails to address the root causes of obesity, such as the lack of education on nutrition and limited access to exercise facilities. Therefore, solely relying on price hikes may not yield comprehensive and long-lasting results. [there’s virtually nothing to comment on – everything’s good]\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, while raising the price of fattening foods can be a step in the right direction [great collocation], it is crucial to supplement it with other comprehensive measures. Public awareness campaigns on healthy eating habits and the importance of regular exercise should be implemented on a national scale. Moreover, the government must spare no effort to improve the accessibility and affordability of nutritious food options, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Combining these initiatives with price increases can create a more holistic approach to combating obesity.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although raising the price of high-calorie foods may discourage their consumption and have some positive effects on reducing obesity rates, it should not be considered a standalone solution. A multi-faceted approach that includes education, accessibility and affordability of healthier food choices is necessary for long-term success.",

        "prompt": "In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.\r\n To what extend do you agree?",
        "essay": "Many divergent views exist on the relevance of educating children in a co-education school. A great number of people, including myself, are of the opinion that children will face many obstacles later in their life if their parents continue to send their children into single-sex schools. In this essay, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoint on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Primary effect on restricting children to only attend single-sex schools is that they will not able to acquire important interpersonal skills to interact with another gender. It goes without saying that when both girls and boys graduate from a university or school, they will be working in their corresponding field of study with another gender. The earlier they know how to behave with another gender, the more they will be able to coordinate and feel comfortable with each other later in their life. My friend, Tina, is a shining example of this. Tina, who was not allowed to communicate with male students during the high-school years because of her family tradition, faced many difficulties in academic life during her tertiary education. Before she knew it, she found very difficult to interact with boys for help in assignments and projects compared to average students.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only do children improve their soft skills, but it also hinders the opportunity to create a social bond with another gender. Many boys develop a good relationship with girls during their school years, and this allows them to understand another gender’s personality, feelings, and thoughts, vice versa. By restricting this formation at the early age of their life will create problems in their life when they need to know about another gender for their marriage life. Unsurprisingly, a 2007 study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto found that those students who had mixed-gender classrooms during their education period have a 90% less divorce rate compared to those students who only had education with similar gender. This is because they are able to understand each other’s opinions, likes, and dislikes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I hold to the opinion that there are many negative points of sending children to the same sex-school. It is my sincere wish that parents should be more open-minded and they should send their children to mix gender schools where their children can acquire many necessary skills that help them in their future.",

        "essay": "A considerable proportion of citizens adopt a preconceived notion that atrocities are considered equal in the eyes of justice despite the legal category age. I strongly oppose  the former declaration, and this essay will hold the reasons for my view.\r\n\r\nTo commence, leading a minor to an equivalent prison for adults has numerous negative repercussions on the generic development of a human. In other words, the type of nutrition that generally includes insufficient nutritional elements is not appropriate in terms of adequate body’s growth. Moreover, there are certain rules inside the jail that oblige prisoners to adjust their daily routines which will affect various physical aspects such as sleeping hours and though works. As reported in the Times magazine in 2015, a significant number of suicide cases under legal age has been registered in police records due to detrimental treatment inside penal institutions. Hence, the experience of balanced punishment facilities has proved harmful effects on the healthy involvements of a young individual. \r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason to support my view is that the mind of a juvenile did not attend a complete maturity in order to be convicted similarly to grown persons. This means that special tribunals are allocated for juniors. Additionally, numerous countries rely on rehabilitation centres because they believe that minors need  special care that will provide a second opportunity  for a prosperous future. To demonstrate, I had my relative who was addicted to drugs,however, the Canadian government procured required assistance which led him to the way of salvation. Thus, conviction is treated differently according to the mental level of each person.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people consider that crimes people must be evaluated identically among social groups. I totally disagree with this statement because of unfavourable consequences on the natural growth and mental completion of an adolescent.",

        "essay": "Many individuals consider that attending higher education is better for a successful career, while others think that entering workforce right after high school. Despite the writer contend that continuing to study is the best way for academic jobs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why having a good job after graduation is more appealing to teenagers. First of all, they can acquire soft skills that are required by the firms. Teenagers will be more independent and enrich their life experiences. Secondly, young people do not have to obey any school rules. They had been controlled by the school’s discipline for many years, therefore, they might think that it is better for them to get a job immediately after finishing high school. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, studying at university or college will have more opportunities to have a high-paid job. First, there are many occupations required specific professional knowledge that they have to study further for those knowledge. For instance, it is crucial that people who want to be a doctor to gain a good qualification in medical field. Secondly, a variety of firm employ people who have professional degrees more than who do not. What I mean is people who have degrees are one step further than who do not. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having a job after high school or continuing to study is a controversial problem in the society, that would depend on their own financial issues. If teenagers have enough ability to studying university, I think they should continue their advanced education.",

        "prompt": "Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Environmental degradation is a rising issue in the contemporary world. According to the number of people, the surge in the price of fuel is a way to mitigate this problem. I agree up to some extent, however, there are other major solutions, mainly restricting waste disposable and deforestation.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, increasing the cost of the fuel is a basic option to cope with the environmental issue. Price hike of the ammunition such as petrol and diesel means, less private vehicles usage, as people would opt to other options for transportation such as public transport system; hence air will not be polluted, as there would be less smoke released from vehicles. China, for instance, in 2016, had been able to decrease the air pollution up to 13%, by introducing fuel’s price increase. Thus, price increase of ammunition is one of the basic measure of saving the environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think there are other effective strategies to address the nature related problems. Firstly, banning waste disposable from industries and factories is one way of solving the rising water pollution issue. This is because disposable materials produced from different industries drained off in the sea and contaminate the water. Which in turn is devastating for sea animals. Another viable option is to discourage deforestation. Cutting trees lead to the deficiency of Oxygen, which is an immense requirement for the better environment. For example, International organization of climate protection has conducted a study that each year climate is becoming deteriorating by the 25% decrease in the production of Oxygen, owing to the deforestation. Therefore, controlling disposable products and prohibiting cutting trees enormously assist in keeping the environment safe.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, to control the degradation of nature is a sparked topic these days. Some people say that increasing the fuel cost is a way. In my view, this will be helpful up to some extent, but there are other efficient measures such as preventing raw disposable materials and cutting trees.\r\n",

While, few of the people considered it as a beneficial factor while, others believe it is not in favour of management. It's a debatable topic, I shall be providing both the views in my essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, if staff are working from their residence, there are several benefits. To start with, people can stay with their family 24/7. There is an increase in the productivity. The cost and the time for travelling will be reduced, due to which, people will feel less fatigue and will be able to provide more working hours. \r\n\r\nSecondly, from the company point of view, workers commuting time will be saved, due to which he will be able to give more time to work. If the employee is coming to office, there will be a wastage of time in communication with other colleagues. Not only the rent of the offices, but also the cost of maintenance will be minimal.

        "essay": "Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.",

        "essay": "It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for   human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to   support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.  On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common   example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug   can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this   kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to   humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.  On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available.   Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part   of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might   feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed   through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are   concerned.  In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research   until equally effective alternatives have been developed.",

        "essay": "There has been a contentious argument over the effect of watching TV and playing computer games on children. This essay examines both points of view and my perspective, being that these activities can be beneficial if the time spent is in moderation. \r\n\r\n Some hold a firm belief that watching television and playing games on  computers have various benefits. Firstly, these sources of entertainment can enhance  brain development. By interacting with the world through those technologies, either real or artificial, their brains’ functions including spatial-visual reasoning can be boosted subconsciously. Furthermore, after a heavy workload of studying, students should find a stress reliever to provide an escape from information overload, therefore, those kinds of entertainment can be extremely suitable for these situations. \r\n\r\n However, others raise voices of disapproval by stating that those leisure activities can have a negative influence on their children. This is because of the excessive amount of time spent on playing video games, which eventually leads to addiction. Nowadays the advancement of these sources of vast media has been to the extent that once young and impressional people take part in, they will grow an instant interest, henceforth, it is hard to stop to do other work such as dealing with homework or reviewing the lessons. To illustrate, a single episode of a popular drama film tends to last 1 hour, let alone a whole season; whereas ,in contrast, students only have few hours to both relax and prepare for the next school day.\r\n\r\n To conclude, both sides have their own merits.

While other people said this dependency has increased day by day, I believe that people are more monotonous and stronger these days. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people advocate that we are more dependent on each other because of modern technologies. Nowadays, the use of technologies has become convenient as it always provides the right solution and answers. So, people become more dependent on them. For example, if people have problems and difficulties, they start to find them on Google first. They do not try to solve the problems by themselves and depend on the internet. Moreover, due to the hectic and busy lives that most families lead, they are always dependent on each other to support them from head to toes even if they have minor problems.  For instance, the parents want to have a great family lifestyle and they have to work harder to fulfil this achievement. Therefore, they need  support from their grandparents for their children's care in order to concentrate on their work. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, technologies have developed day by day, people are more well-informed and open-minded thinking independently than in the past days. To illustrate, in the past days, the students need parents' help to fill the forms and other necessary things for enrolment for their schools. In this modern world, students can find those things on the internet and can do it well themself without  help from their parents. In addition, in the past, people usually get married around their twenty and even earlier. These days, people are likely to have an independent life and want to enjoy more single space before getting married.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it is true that we do depend on others sometimes, however, we always solve our problems and are more independent in this modern world and experience a more thriving life which makes them more confident in their personality.",

Health care and education are usually brought up as examples of sectors that could benefit from more governmental spending.

There are two main reasons behind this and there are reasons and example to support it. These two areas are bad spending behavior and the future demand urgency.\r\nChildren are unable to manage their funds wisely without any guidance from their closest environment, school. Most children would probably spent their money based on what they want. Consequently, a child that have been given a pocket money for school may spend it all on junk food. As a results, it leads to bad eating habits, obesity or consumerism. Teachers could avoids these by only provide healthy food at school environment for example.\r\nOn the other hand, the challenge ahead for these children is more difficult than their older generations.

        "essay": "Quoted from the topic: \"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this\". I disagree completely, because this is a very flawed statement.\r\n\r\nFirstly, business is defined by making profits off of any commercial or professional activities; therefore, businesses cannot be represented by one singular entity but rather by a multitude of entities, each varying in their different objectives. Some lines of business might not even have any social impact or responsibilities at all. Some businesses may even seek to disrupt society for profit, intentionally worsening it. For example, the “Meth Business”, the distribution of methylamine and other addictive substances is a huge threat to young people, but technically, it still qualifies as a form of business because there are demands and profits for these products, albeit not legally.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is absurd to force all businesses to have social responsibilities because not all of them possess the time and money to invest in it. They have already had enough problems to worry about. For example, most of independent businesses in Vietnam are still struggling to handle their employees than bigger organizations that are meant for handling social responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that organizations that do have a helpful status in society should uphold their responsibility, but not all businesses are eligible for this status, and to force them to comply is utterly ridiculous",

Moreover, art also helps them in improving their learning methodology. Meanwhile, with the help of sketching and paintings juveniles can show their creativity to the world.

        "prompt": "Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion?",
        "essay": "Career is an important part of life since It helps people to gain respect as well as wealth. There are two points of view regarding the best way to have a successful career. Some believe that higher education is the best way while others think experience has a bigger effect. Since both views have valid arguments, it can be ignorant if one of them gets dismissed and because of that, this essay will discuss both.\r\n\r\nEducation and experience are two critical factors for a good career. Higher education will help students to learn fundamental science for a job and use them as a source for doing their job. For example, a mechanical engineer learns how a machine works and that knowledge will give him or her the ability to fix them. Although an experienced mechanic can fix machines as well, in case of new and unknown problems, educated mechanics can provide a solution, not experienced ones. On the other hand, studying in college or university will provide a lot of job opportunities for students since a lot of employers demand university degrees these days.\r\n\r\nHowever, going to work without higher education can have benefits. Lots of students study majors at university that they will not pursue as a career. So if students get a job right after high school, it will help them to focus on a career and don't waste time. Plus, with more experience than other people their age, they can apply for higher positions at a younger age.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, having a successful career is most people's goal and there are two ways to achieve that. Some people think that having experience is the most important factor, so getting a job after high school is the best way to have a good career path. In contrast, some people believe that studying at university is more effective. I believe both of these parameters are important, but having a college degree may raise the possibilities and leads people to better paths.",

        "essay": "Some people believe that we could live in an unpredictable environment that results from global warming, whereas others argue that we should find a way to prevent climate change. I totally agree with the latter statement. In this essay, I will give reasons to support my opinion, including examples from my experience.\r\n\r\nFirstly, not only humans but also animals cannot survive in a harsh environment. Therefore, I think finding a way to live with it is wasting our time. In contrast, we should encourage communities to prevent climate change. For example, due to global warming, the weather is getting hotter. Consequently, some people in Africa are suffering from it, and some of them died because they could not bear the weather. Another good example is that one cannot live without animals and plants. If the ecosystem of plants is destroyed, it will affect animals. Unfortunately, humankind will get a negative impact as well.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even if protecting the environment requires huge efforts from communities globally, it will lead to a powerful impact and a last longer solution. For instance, dwellers in Australia are confronting with bushfires every year. Australia alone could not prevent this problem, as global warming needs cooperation from everyone. In addition, rising of the weather one degree Celsius may cause some animals extinctions. Nevertheless, societies could stop this issue by paying more attention to adjusting the way of living now, such as eliminating using plastic bags, reducing gas, etc.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people should immediately start to prevent climate change from today, since it will worsen in the future. Besides, I firmly agree that people should stop doing harmful things to nature because this is the only way to live longer.",

I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.\r\n\r\nThe merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.",

A significant part of the citizens salary is taken in order to keep parks clean, to build new roads, schools and hospitals. In addition, this wage is used to support people who do not have an income or a place to live. Some public services like the police and the fireman get their support for it.

For example, police cars, defensive equipments and salary come from the tax money. \r\n\r\nHowever, although the money of the taxes is essential for these aspects, the tax payers argue that their money is not well invested. Despite of the big amount of fund generated from the taxes, some communities and services do not witness any single improvements or investments.

Moreover, some presidents spend the tax money to travel and for their personal benefit. Furthermore, people are paying an excessive amount of money in taxes regardless their low salary income.

        "essay": "Men have dominated job sector since the industrial revolution, despite progress in gender equality. Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in the tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. \r\n\r\nRegardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their marital and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a college degree or a computer science graduation tends to lower their confidence at work place or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instance, in Asian countries people believe that men are the bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education, but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.\r\n\r\nMany women activists across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As a result of this, today, many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their workforce have equal number of women and men employed. Other than this IT sector need to diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams.",

        "essay": "As competition among companies becomes fiercer, consumers today may  find themselves bombarded with a barrage of advertisements from businesses  trying to promote their products to the general public. In this essay, I will  demonstrate how excessive exposure to commercials may trigger impulse buying  before suggesting some of the ways in which governments can mitigate the  detrimental impacts of advertising.  The harms that advertisements may do to people are definite. The allure of  the vivid graphics and imageries often found in adverts may sway customers to  purchase the products being promoted, even when they have no real need for them.  This is reinforced by celebrity endorsements, which usually have a dramatic  influence on people wanting to imitate their idols. As a consequence, people who  watch too many advertisements generally end up with items that they may  eventually have to discard, resulting in a waste of money. The iPhone covers being  sold in Vietnam perfectly exemplify this situation. Their adverts, which feature  prominent pop stars, can be found positioned on the side panels of most websites in  Vietnam. People who visit these pages often cannon resist the urge to replace their  phone covers with the latest models and waste money on a product that would be of  little value to them.  In order to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions,  governments can adopt some of the following solutions. First and foremost, they  need to exercise censorship on all advertisements. Rigorous content check must be  carried out prior to the publishing of a commercial to ensure the description of a  product accurately reflects its actual quality. In addition, there should be a limit on  the number of platforms on which a company is permitted to market their products.  This would effectively safeguard consumers against information overload and help  them avoid making wasteful purchases.  In conclusion, people who view too many advertisements may be lured into  buying unnecessary things, and the proposed steps should be taken to mitigate this  influence of advertising.",

Although tertiary studies can reinforce the future career development of an individual , in my opinion , I affirm that the interested students must be promoted to start working straight away after acquiring their basic education.Let us discuss this in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, let us shed light on the argument that higher education is crucial for a better future. First and foremost, most professionals are highly qualified. In addition, the doctors, engineers or whoever decorating the higher positions in the society are well qualified with graduation and post-graduation certificates  that made them  lead a successful and satisfactory career in their life. For example, in India the staff members of the schools are categorised as principals, teachers, administrators and other lower grade positions are employed based on their academic qualifications which include the level of their degrees that helped them to create a successful pathway.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are certain points to support the decision of working without university qualifications. Primarily, personal skills are the building blocks of a successful staff member in his organisation. Moreover, leadership qualities, time management, emotional intelligence and collaboration and cooperation among a team are playing a crucial role in the achievements of a staff member. For instance, the success behind the Microsoft company is the patience and leadership qualities of Bill Gates rather than his tertiary qualifications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the overall development of a successful career is the subtotal of educational certificates and the innate characteristics of an individual. In my point of view, the factors behind a rewarding career are decided by the personal interest of a person whether he or she is affiliated with studies or would like to cultivate their personal  skills.",

        "prompt": "High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?",
        "essay": "Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.",

This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of candidates' values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPersonality quizzes can be another useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses.

Large number of companies would prefer to invest one time in a mechanical device to handle their work load rather hiring individual and paying them every month for the same work. The famous companies like the Amazone prefer to have an automated infrastructure and their robots are performing precisely speedy taskes compared to human power. Due to these reasons, there are lot of chances that number of jobs will be performed by an artificial intelligence .\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some taskes which can never be replaced by robots as it only requires human touch and brain. Robots will not be able to cope with such highly demanding task because , robot only respond to the things that are programmed in their system. These jobs include doing experiments, surgeries erc. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are majority of chances that large number of employment will be taken over by robots instead of humans.

        "prompt": "Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of one international organization rather than the responsibility of each national government. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
        "essay": "It is argued that one global institution should be responsible for environmental problems, while some people believe that each national government should take responsibility instead. While acknowledging the reasons for this proposal, I partly agree with it for several reasons. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are a lot of compelling reasons that environmental problems should be the duty of each national government. Initially, for artificial environmental problems, only the government could have the jurisdiction and capability to solve their own troubles. In fact, man-made environmental issues mostly might come from the big factories that could affect the economy of the country. It is the truth that one international organization could not have the authority to regulate these corporations and they might not grasp the complexities of the issues to deal with it in the best way. Therefore, the national government, who already understands the problems should take charge for their actions and solve their national artificial environmental problems since only them could possess adequate authority and could have the optimal strategy to address these issues in their own country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in some emergency circumstances, such as natural disasters, the national government might find themselves lacking capability and resources to face it and in this case, one international organization should be in charge of these problems. It is obvious that, in the emergency circumstances such as sudden natural disasters, international organizations could provide money, food or even specialists in these fields. To be specific, since the global institution attracts a sum of power and experience from different countries around the world, they would have the ability to help these nations in a suitable way. For example, if a country  has to deal with a tidal wave for the first time and they have difficulties in dealing with it, the international organization could help them by combining the experience and knowledge from the previous disasters or they could gather the specialists in these problems to find an optimum choice for that nation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the division of responsibility is clear: national governments should address human-made environmental problems, while international organizations should take charge of natural disasters. This allocation of roles ensures a comprehensive and effective approach to addressing the diverse environmental challenges our world faces.",

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.\r\nFinancial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.\r\nWhat then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the \"how to do\". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",

        "essay": "The industrial revolution has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for a large section of the world population. But it has not been able to catch up with the ever-increasing population that has more than doubled in the last half a century. In this essay we will discuss specifically how lack of growth aspirations of nations deprives its citizens of means to feed itself and how too much of it  causes environmental impact for the next generation.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we should understand that the immediate solution to the hunger problem is by alleviating people from their poverty. This can be done by creating employment opportunities through the introduction of free-market policies by the government which can help incubate new businesses and also existing businesses to thrive. It is clearly a win-win situation all around because it is an organic way to solve a systemic problem.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, traditional means of growing food such as agriculture and horticulture will have to be scaled to meet the growing demand of the population. This will mean acquiring land through deforestation and creating new water systems by building dams. Although this would create employment opportunities for the local people, it will also affect the environment because the flora and fauna will be completely destroyed. The entire ecosystem that depended on them will also vanish over a period of time affecting the future generations and subjecting them to unknown challenges.\r\n\r\nToday's generation has to make sure the economy continues to grow such that earning opportunities are available for everyone.

These days some people think that there are benefits in going to private schools and others feel that public ones are better for overall development. In my opinion,  government institutions are much better as students will get a chance to interact with diverse family and cultural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPrivate secondary schools are more focused to maintain education standards. This type of facility ensures that all the learners will study hard to have good scores in the board exams. However, getting admission to these institutions is pretty hard as they conduct an initial test to match students' knowledge bar. Because of these standards, most of the crowd wants to raise their loved ones in a private facility.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people think that limiting the environment can cause a negative effect on  learners. In basic education, children need to have exposure to  diverse curricula for better social learning. People also feel that public institutions pay an attention to both mental and physical development. Moreover, these places don't require a lot of admission fees and provide opportunities for all types of families to get their children educated.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I think private secondary facilities are more focussed on one area which may limit the learning of children. On the other hand, public organisations provide a better ambience where students can learn, play & make new friends irrespective of their family background. However, money also plays a vital role in an individual's life in deciding a learning place for their children.",

        "essay": "Some countries prefer to single gender school for the education of their pupils. A native of some countries, prefer to send their children to the integrated institutions for their elementary education, because they believe it can affect drastically to their life in the upcoming period. I firmly believe that co-educational institutions are a boon, not only for the healthy future of children, but also for the nation as well.\r\nFirstly, pupils who studied in single sex schools, take huge time to get involved in conversation with the opposite gender, the reason behind is, they never experienced public conversation earlier, therefore, pupils do not feel comfortable to speak publicly and get nervous when they have to ask any question or any favor. Moreover, children who get more comfortable in their own group, sometimes behave in improper way with others as few conversations should remain with close people. Most importantly the context of delivery of words should be accurate and proper; otherwise it could hurt the emotions of others or could leave the person embarrassed. The way of using proper words and gesture could develop by studding together.\r\nFurthermore, students can learn and observe various things from their peer which are having opposite gender by doing healthy competition. This would lead to developing many traits which will enhance their knowledge and experience in a positive way. They will learn the sensitivity of words and acts that is lucrative for their own healthy future. In short, students who studied in co-educational schools are more disciplined and punctual.\r\nIn conclusion, students can have many skilled traits by studding together along with students of different age, religion and gender, which is possible by getting enrolled in integrated schools.

        "essay": "These days a large number of couples decide to have babies after spending at least few years since their marriage. According to some experts, there are various reasons which urge parents to have children later in their life. Career, changes in social belief, women empowerment, escalating living expenses, increased life expectancy are some of the major causes of this trend. In my belief advantages of having children later in life outweigh its demerits.\r\n\r\nFirst, a growing number of parents are very passionate and enthusiastic in terms of career development and their profession is the primary reason they do not expect to have children in the early stage of their marriage. It is intuitively obvious that in this age of huge competition, unemployment and economic crisis, people around the world are constantly worried about their career and job promotions. As a result, parents decide and determine to postpone their first childbirth. Second, women empowerment has changed the old way of life where a woman's sole responsibility was to look after the children. Since many wives are working these days, they decide to take babies after they reach a stable job position.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, social belief regarding giving birth of children has changed dramatically and people are more concerned about the living expenses than the number of babies they have, unlike older generations. Additionally, parents who study full-time in universities can not concentrate on their studies competently if they become parents. Enhanced life expectancy and changes in the social belief are two other reasons for this trend.\r\n\r\nUndeniably people who either work or run a business can reach to a stable position before becoming parents. Thus they can take better care of their babies which would have been impossible if the baby was born earlier. It is often a fact that having offspring early in life can escalate expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. In particular, if the parents cannot allocate time for them, they grow up with psychological issues. Such young parents often lack the knowledge and time they need to properly take care the baby. Ultimately, parents might put their career at a risk as well as the future of their children if they become parents before they are mentally and economically stable.\r\n\r\nReversely, having offspring in early life have few advantages. Such parents have new members in their family and their isolation would be extirpated and they will become more family-oriented.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the pleasure of having a new baby in early years of marriage, parents who decide to have babies later can primarily, readily and precisely focus on their career, can easily fulfill financial requirements and have sufficient time to persist, strive and struggle in order to have a stunning, and illuminated future in life.",

Some individuals believe that the price of fuel should be increased to tackle this problem. Although I agree with this opinion, I think that the increasing rate of fuel cost would also have negative effects on society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial. According to this, many people would avoid driving their own cars since they will not be able to afford the high cost of fuel. Besides, they will be motivated to take more public transportation instead of their private cars, resulting in decreasing the heavy traffics. Therefore, the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems. For instance, many people have died annually as a result of lung cancer and respiratory diseases that are caused by air pollution.\r\n\r\non the other hand, increasing the fuel cost would have many drawbacks. Firstly, the public transportation cost will be escalated due to the expensive fuel. Secondly, the transportation expenses for businesses would also be raised. In such cases, companies will be forced to increase the prices of their products to compensate for these high expenses. Thus, people would be burdened with higher living costs. If the government can control these increasing rates of transportation and goods, the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while increasing the fuel cost could place many people under the pressure of difficult economic situations, I agree that it is vital for solving environmental problems.",

From my perspective, this is primarily a positive phenomenon despite some drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, what should be carefully considered is the efficiency of digital courses. If students enrol in online lectures at open places such as coffee shops, they will be easily distracted by extrinsic factors. Hence, they might not fully comprehend these lectures. Moreover, some soft skills, such as communication skills or teamwork, might be best trained and practised in person. Therefore, when they do not attend physical classes, such skills do not seem to be effectively enhanced. Eventually, virtual courses might be potentially detrimental to learning efficiency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, online courses are beneficial for both learners and universities. First and foremost, students can effortlessly access reading references and online lectures with electronic devices connected to the Internet. Hence, they can actively schedule their timetable and learn wherever they wish; for instance, some might want to study at a coworking space which can foster their creativity. Additionally, universities could also optimize their operation cost by curtailing the budgets used for basic commodities served on campus. Expenditures on electricity or water could be taken as prime examples.

Hence, this fact-based essay will examine both perspectives of this phenomenon and proffer my concluding opinion.\r\nThere is a plethora of underlying rationales for why producers and marketers should control the overusing of packaging. To begin with, it appears to be undeniable that they should applied recycle materials to contain foods and drinks, which can reused to cover beverages again. Perhaps one of the most self-evident and much-discussed examples of this can be observed when beer bottles are usually collected and brought to plans in order to remake and sell a second time. And what is more, another salient point frequently made is that they should find out the best way to simplify the wrapping process to consumed fewer bags, which still perfectly protect products.\r\nWhen viewed from a distinctive angle; notwithstanding, I also concede that consumers also have the function to reduce the using of packages. First and foremost, citizens can bring their own bags while shopping to avoid taking numerous nilon bags which offered by sellers.

        "essay": "The familiar and well-known for everyone teaching situation of a teacher and pupils in the class will be disappeared in 2050. I totally agree with this statement and, in this essay, I am going to provide some proves of it. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, an educational system at large will be significantly changed due to the technological progress. In the nearest future, maybe, there will be no teachers in the traditional way of understanding their purpose. Robots and various educational platforms will replace professors and face-to-face communication. For example, some Japanese schools have been using robots in the study process during several years and the average level of knowledge has not suffered till now, even it has slightly improved. Thus, there is no doubt that in 30 years there will be another considerable change in an educational sphere. \r\n\r\nSecondly, more and more schools in different countries have decided to change their teaching approaches. Nowadays, modern teachers prefer to become mentors for their students. It can be explained by the fact that self-education is more effective than the common way of learning. For instance, some American schools have started to implement the mentioned approach in their practice. The result was stunning as pupils have showed better performance and, consequently, better grades for exams. Hence, it can be predicted by experts that there are no reasons to stay conservative and refuse opportunities for the development. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I absolutely agree that the usual teaching method can be replaced by more innovative one. According to the speed of the world progress there is no sense to preserve the traditional learning way.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.\r\nYou should write at least 250 words.",
        "essay": "The climate is changing drastically resulting from the various human practices like extraction of fossil fuels or reckless urbanization. In this regard, some people believe that preserving the climate is not an option anymore; instead there is a necessity to develop alternatives to survive. In my opinion, I do not agree with the statement completely as we need to work on both preservation and finding new ways.\r\nTo begin with, it is crucial to conserve the climate as it is connected with other phenomena. Any change in climate hampers the weather cycle and consequently affecting the crops. For instance, all crops require large quantities of water to grow, so if the monsoon is procrastinated, it results in the devastation of crops. A sufficient amount of rainfall is important for crops to get fully matured. Moreover, it will not only affect the food chain but also cause inflation within the country. In general, it is a fundamental responsibility to safeguard the climate so that the present situation won’t get exacerbate. \r\nNecessity is the mother of invention and exploring new options to cope-up with the prevailing circumstances is a must. It is essential to develop new technologies that can be beneficial in elevating our living standards. For illustration, sustainable development should be brought on track. By analyzing the causes of change and developing efficient techniques that can lower down the concerns is highly beneficial. Therefore, finding different ways is a necessity to deal with the present challenges and to deter their occurrence in the future.\r\nTo conclude, I can say that conserving climate bears equal importance as exploration for different alternatives. Hence, I reckon that prevention and discoveries should go hand in hand, only then we will be able to lead a comfortable life and providing coming generations with a safe and healthy environment.",

But, I don't agree with this opinion and my view will be elaborated on in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe idea to increase the fattening food price can be the reason to reduce this type of food consumption  but it can affect  society in other ways like difficulty for those people who really need it. It can result in out-of-reach for  poor people. For  example, fatty food can be very important for skinny people to gain  weight and increasing costs will affect their budget.\r\n\r\nAlso increasing the price of junk food or fatty food can reduce the market of this kind of food and will bring the market down for those people who are getting direct income from this sector.

        "essay": "While some people are with the view that art should be included as the most important subject in primary learning, quite a few people oppose and believe it is completely worthless. In my opinion, art should be part of fundamental education to ensure the knowledge based development of the children; however, this essay will discuss both views.\r\nOn the one hand, art facilitates the process of the intellectual development of the children. Many forms of arts, such as music, acting and drawing not only promotes a person's talent, but also develops imagination and sense of humour. Moreover, it improves communication skill and co-operation among the youngster. Therefore, including such subjects at the educational institution will allows young individuals to grasp these life-oriented aspects. For instance, a recent study conducted by \"Monster.Come\" reveals that the children, who are involved in music or drama club at school, are more managerial than others.\r\nOn the other hand, incorporating such modules in the school curriculum would be negative for the pupil because it might hamper their studies. If students are associated with these extra-curriculum activities, they will get a little time for learning. As a result, the fundamental objective of primary education will be affected. Despite this, these creative activities have positive impacts on the pupils, which will also promote their education. For example, there are many students, who stand at the top of the formal examinations, are also practiced singing or drawing.\r\nIn conclusion, although it is significant to add extra-curricular subjects in the school syllabus, some individuals think it is useless as the basic purpose of the study will get affected. Nevertheless, this would be advantageous for the pupils as it will develop their cognitional issues.",

I firmly coincide with and withstand the stated notion that it will expose the student in the line of the employment environment.This discourse will further elucidate my assertion in the forthcoming paragraph.\r\n\r\nFirstly,this kind of exposure is very advantagious to the young stars although the society is not really for it.They end up practising what they are taught in lecture rooms as a results the gain experience and get exposure particularly in their area of interest.Moreover,work experience can help them land their dream job because most recruiters prefer to employ individuals with some experience.For example,a research done by kepsa(2020) depicts that 90% of employer prefer to give a job to people who have gone for an internship which help them as they do not take long to adapt to the system.Consequently,it is imperative for school-going people to undertake part-time attachment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,this can be detrimental since it can bring some disruption in the study although the student understands and retain more when they practice what they are taught in the classroom.Furthermore ,the scholar is not in a position to prepare for exams or even attend group discussion with others as there are duties allocated to them by the employer.For example,a research done by  the University of Nairobi depicts that part-time jobs for finalists make them drop out of school.Therefore,a certain individual does not advise pupils to work as it affects their performance as well as some end up dropping out of the academy\r\n\r\nTo sum up,i would like to restate the perspective that i concur that undergraduates must take part-time jobs to gain relevant experience for the sake of future dream jobs despite others advocating that it will affect the graduate end results.",

For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
        "essay": "According to various ,reports there is a high proportion of poorly educated criminals among the total share. Therefore some people suggest providing literacy for released from prisons people in order to help them to adapt and have a decent work placement. I can agree with the idea because there are some practical benefits both for the individual and the society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, commonly known that most criminals tend to repeat their mistakes or having some particular habits from prison. This makes them very vulnerable as not many employers can invite them to work, ,Moreover a concrete degree and a high in demand speciality can increase the chance of entering the labour market, because when there is a lack of human resources more people are welcomed. For example, intense demand for truck drivers caused by Brexit, gives a  motivation for ex-prisoners to be trained and then employed.  In addition, following training expenses can be comparatively less than spendings on prisoners keeping and the damage they can possibly make if the crimes will be repeated. Is not it easier to prevent a criminal rather than to punish him later? \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this issue has been existing for a long time, and countries with a more educated society have the lowest crime rate in the world. Children who spend most of their time  studying and hobbies are more likely to persuade higher education and achieve career goals. Parents of those invest significant time and money to create and support the interest of studying of their youngers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude it is logical that the education system needs to be improved, because it will decrease the possibility of a crime committing. I think that released from prison should be given a chance for further study to have a better environment in order to avoid more crimes.",

        "essay": "Since the introduction of the internet, people have always debated whether the illegal usage of such technologies will outweigh the advances it will bring forth. One of the main topics to talk about is the music industry. It is clear that no matter what is done unauthorized usage of tracks can not be controlled, yet the question that remains is \"Does it have a profound effect on the whole industry?\".\r\n\r\nFirstly, it should be noted that the phenomenon definitely has a negative sum result. Some people stand behind the idea that such actions will hurt the music. The line of thought they have is, that if an artist is making less money as a result of an individual not paying to buy the track, they will have less to produce the next one. This is true, especially in the case of newcomers to the business. They are the ones at the highest risk since they cannot make enough capital to go on if similar actions go on.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can be said that while the negative consequences are clear, there is little that change they bring. This is the result of two main factors. The major one is, the consumer who uses such methods. As a recent internet analysis showed, most of the illegal downloaders are from poorer countries ,who normally cannot afford to pay for songs. This translates to almost no income lost since the person who got the song through illegal means wouldn't have paid for it anyway.\r\n\r\nMoreover, On another side of the issue, lies the publicity of the artist who would not have made it if these smaller songs didn't go around so much. For instance, we can look at the case of WestGhoust, a singer who made sure his songs could not be attained through such measures. His career did not bloom as well as it should have, showing the fault in his way.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we have to pay attention to the unequal distribution of capital and its effects on the music industry. In my opinion, it can easily be made clear ,that the little amount of cash lost wouldn't have made a considerable impact on any artist.",

        "essay": "With the advancement of technology in sectors like fashion and media, certain famous personalities have built up a name for themselves by showing off their wealth and luxurious lifestyles. It is being argued that this trend is influencing the youth in an unfavourable manner and I completely agree with it. The subsequent paragraphs will elaborate on the reasons why.\r\n\r\nFirstly, certain famous figures like models, actors, singers, and influencers, claim themselves to be the richest in the country or the most followed on social media. It is not for something they accomplished by their own work but with certain manipulations and influences in the industry. In fact, despite having a huge fanbase or living in the penthouse of an apartment complex, when it comes to their profession, they lack the necessary skills. For instance, one of the most listened-to male idols in South Korea, Jimin failed to impress the fans with his live vocals during his latest comeback. The majority of the youth that follows these people are high schoolers and it gives them the wrong idea that fame means everything until  proven otherwise.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, witnessing how fame raises people to a glamorous, unattainable lifestyle, the youth believes that it is the key to their success, which in my opinion is very delusional.  After being misled by their favourite celebrity, as soon as leaving school  youngsters will choose to be a model or a ticktock influencer aiming for instant popularity, rather than focusing on a long-lasting career. Subsequently, it will take them time to realize the negative consequences of their decisions but by then it will be too late to turn back.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undeniably true that the youth of a country is heavily affected by the behaviour of certain celebrities in both positive and negative ways,however it depends upon how the youth actually addresses the issue at hand.",

Visual  arts evoke emotions through an expression of skill and imagination. In the course of this essay, both views will be discussed to form an opinion. \r\n\r\n    Firstly, children should be given an opportunity to learn art be it visual or fine, this makes them express their selves, giving them a wide range of imagination and also to recreate it in paints and drawings. To illustrate, my brother loves to draw and play with colours, he said he loves drawing because it gives him the ability to recreate and create things in his own way and style. To conclude, when they learn to draw and paint in school, they become so engrossed in it thereby making a good career,hobby and opportunity for them. \r\n\r\n       Secondly, visual drawing has become less recognizable in our society because people have diverted their selves from the reality of creativity through craft as such most people find it time-consuming to allow their children to do visual or fine art. They prefer them going into stuff they think will make a good Carrier for them: without knowing the effect it causes on them emotionally and physically. For example, my neighbour warned his son not to involve himself in craft or any art subject, the reason is it will not be of good pay to him in future. This made him very sad and gloomy because he would rather love to draw and paint than solve some boring maths. In conclusion, we should give into the profession of painting and drawing.\r\n\r\n         By and large, fine art  is a way of communication. In my opinion, youngsters should be encouraged to learn the art of painting and drawing as this can make a lifetime career for them.",

Secondly , citizens can spend their quality time there after  hectic daily schedules and they are  controversial places to work out . Moreover , increasing air pollution makes people worry and harms their health; therefore, squares and parks provide relaxation and wholesome environment to humans. For example , Thong Nhat park ,which is one of the biggest parks of Ha Noi , attracts many residents and foreign people doing exercise or work out.\r\n\r\n In addition , there are many trees and flowers planted around the park, which is helpful to air-conditioning and reduce air pollution , carbon dioxide emission in the cities .Also , some large beautiful public areas attract tourists and become well-known destinations .

        "essay": "Celebrities these days are mostly known for their glamour and prosperities in comparison to their acquirements and this can be considered to be negatively exemplary for younger generations. This essay will agree with the given idea of misguiding young people since it can convey false hopes to teenagers and increasingly enable the celebrities’ industry with spoiled influencers.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, endorsing charm and wealth rather than achievements allows people to misinterpret the actual way to become a celebrity. This means that people with decent background and attractive physique can effortlessly be a famous person, consequently making other individuals to think that they may never become a celebrity without those supports.On the other hand, teenagers with their original assets are likely to assume being a public figure will not take a considerable effort. This will definitely make them desperate when they encounter the real situation in life.\r\n\r\nAnother reason could be the establishment of fake societies of celebrities. When adolescents are tempted to become a celebrity in a way that neglects hard work and advocates outer contributions and if they somehow become such people, this will potentially impact the overall authenticity of film industries. Hence, they may promote further inauthentic societies of famous people by broadcasting movies that emphasize attractiveness and wealth. Additionally, research shows that people tend to imitate what they see, ultimately contributing to encourage more corrupted influencers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although glamour and wealth are arguably the assets of a celebrity, I do not agree that they are choosing them over achievements as it can make young people misunderstand and form a superficial community of influencers. Therefore, it is recommended that they balance the essential ethical codes of a typical celebrity.",

Technological advancements might lead to job replacements in some current areas. The demand for highly-skill workers in some fields such as artificial intelligence or data analysis increase whilst lower-skilled jobs may see reduced demand.

        "essay": "The significant growth of consumer products manufacturing has led to more detrimental effects on the natural environment. I believe that there are several root causes and solutions to address this issue will be proposed. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the consumerism culture of today’s society has caused more harm to wildlife habitats for two main reasons, including the industrial emission from the production process and packaging waste from the goods disposal. Wastes and pollutants discharged from the manufacturing process are unavoidable by-products. In fact, factory machines are generally powered by fossil fuels, for this reason, carbon-dioxide will be released which might severely pollute the surrounding air. Furthermore, product packaging assembled from plastic and paper needs a longer time to degrade naturally. As a result, it could end up contaminating the oceans, rivers, lakes, and what is even more dangerous is the fact that it could seriously endanger the inhabitants when the waste is accidentally swallowed.\r\n\r\nSeveral actions should be prompted in order to mitigate the problem. Firstly, the government should take a bold move to impose a stricter law on sustainable manufacturing process and waste-management. To do so, the government can regulate the use of renewable energies to replace fossil fuels as well as encourage the utilization of low-energy-consumption machines. Secondly, to reduce unnecessary waste from product packaging, the consumer goods companies need to use an eco-friendly material which is considerably more compostable, for example, packaging made from plant-based resources such as corn and wheat straw.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, waste caused by the production of consumer goods is unavoidable, therefore comprehensive actions from the government and companies are needed to alleviate the problems immediately in order to conserve and protect the natural environment.",

        "essay": "Social networking sites, for instance Facebook, are thought by some to have had a  detrimental effect on individual people as well as society and local communities.  However, while I believe that such sites are mainly beneficial to the individual, I  agree that they have had a damaging effect on local communities.  With regards to individuals, the impact that online social media has had on each  individual person has clear advantages. Firstly, people from different countries are  brought together through such sites as Facebook whereas before the development  of technology and social networking sites, people rarely had the chance to meet or  communicate with anyone outside of their immediate circle or community.  Secondly, Facebook also has social groups which offer individuals a chance to meet  and participate in discussions with people who share common interests.  On the other hand, the effect that Facebook and other social networking sites have  had on societies and local communities can only be seen as negative. Rather than  individual people taking part in their local community, they are instead choosing  to take more interest in people online. Consequently, the people within local  communities are no longer forming close or supportive relationships. Furthermore,  society as a whole is becoming increasingly disjointed and fragmented as people  spend more time online with people they have never met face to face and who they  are unlikely to ever meet in the future.  To conclude, although social networking sites have brought individuals closer  together, they have not had the same effect on society or local communities. Local  communities should do more to try and involve local people in local activities in  order to promote the future of community life.",

Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.",
        "essay": "It is generally argued that educational systems should allow high students to contribute to their teachers, or even make criticism; diametrically opposes that, others believe it exerts an adverse consequence due to a lack of respect and discipline in the classroom. This essay will delve into both views and give a conclusion. \r\n\r\nIt can’t deniable that students having a voice in the classroom may boost their motivation. For instance, some high schools in Ho Chi Minh have collected student feedback to improve their education quality; therefore, teachers know what problems students get and find out effective solutions. Parallelly, learners open the doors to demonstrate their capabilities as well as feel appreciated since their contributions can help their lessons enhance which is considered a stepping stone for students to take more responsibility for their schooling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if high school students are given permission to express their thoughts about their educators, this somehow can bring an abuse of rights. In other words, teenagers who do not fully develop their social awareness and knowledge easily misbehave when submitting comments in the classroom. For example, when disagreeing with teachers’ approaches, the youth tend to communicate with indecent languages, but educators still receive these opinions causing learners likely to think that their knowledge is better than that of teachers and instructors have to listen to them. As a result, in some cases, the classroom will become chaotic since students inevitably no longer follow instructions given by teachers failing to gain their respect.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in the views of aforementioned arguments, my unshakable conviction is that the disadvantages of giving students a right to comment on their teachers will surpass its advantages.",

        "essay": "Nowadays media sources extremely affect  modern society all around the world, especially its opinions. However, the impact of the mentioned phenomenon is not precise, while discussions are becoming more colliding. In my view, newspapers as one of the most fluent tools of governmental structures have a great effect on  human view. The present essay will cover the core reason reasons for this and illustrate positive consequences.\r\n\r\nRegarding the causes of such influence, social media has been a crucial tool of any government since the press was created. Using this field as the area of national interests, states still have an opportunity to provide the most appropriate position which will increase the loyalty of the audience. For example, within the USSR era propaganda was on the peak of the agenda as the option to control the population's minds. Hence, the effect of such policy is still colossal and it influences each society a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, in light of the pros and cons of this influence, it is hard to generally evaluate the situation at the current moment. For instance, today information is not only provided by a variety of paper-based editions, but a vast majority of media have their own websites, YouTube and Telegram channels, and so on. This leads to the existence of the constitutional right of the freedom of speech which is significant for the modern world. As a result, every person has the possibility to choose which sources can be trusted by him or her. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it should be said that  the principal issue is focused on propagandizing the most loyal and appreciated point of view by governments. Nevertheless, the scores of editions are giant, thus it has a positive impact on humankind. It should be widespread that  freedom of speech is totally important for the population. In this regard, it will influence people's views, but they will have a choice to what extent any information seems to be true and realistic.",

        "essay": "Consumers are undoubtedly influenced by the vast number of advertisements bombarding them daily. The extent of this influence varies, but it's undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior. Various measures can be implemented to protect consumers from potentially misleading or harmful effects of advertisements.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Advertisements, firstly,  Psychological Impact;  Advertisements often leverage psychological tactics to create emotional connections with consumers, influencing their preferences and purchase decisions. For example, emotionally compelling advertisements can shape perceptions and build brand loyalty. Secondly, Brand Recognition; Repetition and exposure through advertising contribute to brand recognition. Consumers are more likely to choose familiar brands, even if they are not necessarily the best or most suitable for their needs. Third, Social Influence, Social media advertisements and influencer marketing can significantly impact consumer choices. Recommendations from peers and influencers can create a sense of trust and credibility, influencing purchasing decisions.\r\n\r\nMeasures to Protect Consumers; fundamentaly, transparency in Advertising; Governments and regulatory bodies should enforce transparency in advertising practices. Companies must provide accurate information about their products or services, preventing misleading claims or false representations. Sequentially, Educating Consumers; Promoting media literacy and consumer education is crucial. By enhancing consumers' critical thinking skills, they can better discern between honest advertisements and those employing manipulative tactics. Another way , Stricter Regulations; Governments can introduce and enforce stricter regulations on advertising content. This includes monitoring and penalizing companies that engage in deceptive advertising or make false claims about their products. Moreover, Ethical Standards for Influencers; Establishing ethical standards for influencers in the digital space is essential. Clear guidelines and regulations can prevent the endorsement of products based solely on financial incentives without genuine belief in their quality. For example,\r\n\r\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, governments rigorously regulate drug advertisements to ensure that the information presented is accurate and not misleading. Strict guidelines mandate the inclusion of potential side effects, helping consumers make informed decisions about their health.\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion, Consumers are undoubtedly influenced by advertisements, and while this influence can be positive, it also raises concerns about deceptive practices. Implementing measures such as transparency, education, stricter regulations, and ethical standards can help protect consumers from potentially harmful effects and ensure a fair marketplace. A well-informed consumer base is key to fostering a marketplace where advertisements serve as informative tools rather than manipulative influences.",

This essay states the reasons for this and how people can research them.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why people are interested in finding the history of the house.  One major reason is, people want to know if there is any bad luck that might be associated with that house or building.  Sometimes, the ex-houseowner may hide the accidents that had happened in the house.  For instance, there may be someone who was murdered or who commited suicide in the flat before, this may cause discomfort or disgust for people living in there.

        "essay": "Climate change has become a worrisome aspect of everyone present in the earth. We cannot remain complicit with the drastic change of climate, as it would lead to unimaginable repercussions. Therefore, I certainly disagree with the notion that one should care less about the worsening trend of climate change. This essay will discuss about the various ideas by which climate change can be impeded, thereby saving this earth. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the heat sinks of the earth which are Arctic and Antarctic regions have already sounded alarm bells 4 decades ago, by massive melting of ice caps. The reasons are simple, the temperature of the earth has been risen beyond 4 degrees, resulting in the increase of ocean level as well as the decline in the level of ice sheets. It is definitely possible to undo this damage by reducing the emission of carbon footprint in the atmosphere. Furthermore, this hegemonic carbon comes majorly from the fossil fuels which constitute a lion’s share in heating the surface temperature of the earth. If we move towards using bio fuel sources like bio plants or Jetropa there would not be much carbon content in our atmosphere, thereby the surface temperature of the earth begins to reduce and so the heat sink regions can be protected from the global warming meltdown. \r\n\r\n It is definitely not a Sisyphean task to accomplish, as one of the country has already commenced an approach on carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, the industries in France have begun to collect their emitted carbon gases and arrest them beneath the surface of the earth to convert the gases into diamonds. However, it takes several years to convert the carbon content to diamond. In addition to that, nuclear power plants constitute the next higher emission of carbon to our environment. The harmful isotopes increase the global heat multi-fold than the fossil fuels. Therefore, we need to put a solid full stop to nuclear power plants and their submarines which emit an immeasurable amount of carbon to our environment and to our oceans. Finally, our trees are the natural saviour in preserving the earth’s temperature. Had there been no massive felling of trees, there would be no global warming. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, our earth is the only wonderful planet in our universe that supports human, animal and aquatic life to live in harmony. Instead of exploring various planetary missions across the universe to determine whether human life is possible, it would be better if we preserve this earth from falling into a trap of global warming and an irrevocable climate change.",

Meanwhile, many believe that it would disturb their learning. According to me, it is better to have one year spare to excel in some skills other than studies. Further, the essay will explain my viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I would say, it must be added to the curriculum to practice one year for other vocational learning. This means anyone can get a chance to learn the skill, that would help him further in his hard times. For instance, I personally experience the same, after completing my schooling, I  spent six months learning the basics of stitching clothes, as that thing helped me a lot  throughout my life. As, I have saved my money in terms of the stitching fee of tailors, which are too  demanding these days. Moreover, there is so much vocational training in different fields which can be beneficial for both males and females. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be possible that, if a pupil takes a break after schooling in any circumstance, there are chances that he may indulge in unhealthy activities. That may damage their personalities in the long run. For example, adults can be distracted by the bad company of friends. They may become  prone to mobile or social media, or towards other divergences if there is no assignment for them. Furthermore, one significant drawback is, the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger, as, they tend to be lazy and inactive.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, few individuals think it is preferable to take a break from studying after finishing  school while others have a different opinion. Pupils can get vocational learning at this time, but there are chances that they would harm their behaviour due to bad company or less beneficial activities. \r\n\r\n In my view, there must be a gap of twelve months to learn any skill that earns in difficulties.",

Personally, elderly people are not an appropriate age to have a baby so negative outcomes would outweigh advantages.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are many crucial reasons why some individuals decide to have a baby at an old life in the developed world such as generating a bunch of income, which provides job security and a better lifestyle. Moreover, Some claim that giving childbirth at a young age when they are not ready not only provides a number of responsibilities to them but also reduces the freedom, which allows them to hang out with their comrades and family. In addition, from the medical surveys, 80% of mothers in an elderly life spend most of their time on hectic work due to lack of income.   \r\n\r\nHowever, common abnormalities of childbirth such as Down syndrome, heart problems and other issues due to lack of nutrition in pregnancy are the most horrible effect which affects both mother's and offsprings' lifestyle in the short-term and long-term. Furthermore, the ability to take care of offspring at that life significantly decreases as they are too old to carry their offspring and play with them. Most medical research shows that a large number of abnormal children mostly happened in this phenomenon and mothers experienced losing childbirth before giving birth as physical issues. \r\n\r\n In conclusion, Although generating incomes is vital for some communities, people should be more concerned about this as negative outcomes affect either mother or children, which leads to physical and mental issues after give-birth.",

Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year.

It is believed that by increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles can solve environmental issues. I moderately agree with this opinion and think that in addition to this there are various other methods to reduce the level of pollutions such as introducing battery operated vehicles, and planting more trees.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believed that increasing the fuel cost will limit the usage of cars or other vehicles which in turn reduce the level of pollution to some extent. However, introducing battery operated vehicles can drastically decrease the levels of environmental pollution such as air pollution, as there will be no CO2 emissions. A good example to illustrate this idea is everlasting beauty of Switzerland where government has ban the fuel operated vehicles and make it compulsory for all its citizens to use eco-friendly cars in order to protect the environment they live in. Thus, not only increasing the cost of fuel can reduce the level of pollution, but also introducing eco-friendly cars can help to reduce the level of pollutions in air.\r\n\r\nSecondly, planting more trees is a natural way to clean air, water and soil. In other words, Trees plays an important role during the process of photosynthesis in which trees take in CO2 and produce the oxygen we breathe and thus improve the quality of air. In addition to this, it also help to conserve water, preserve soil and support wildlife. Switzerland is a prime example for such an initiative where planting trees are applauded whereas trading of wood, cutting trees for furniture’s are strictly prohibited and considered serious offence which may even results in life time prison.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I moderately agree that not only increasing the cost of fuel will help reduce the environmental issues but also believes that use of battery as a fuel and planting more trees can drastically improve the quality of environment.",

Besides, many companies via advertising have been selling not high quality products, because of a good clip outweigh high quality in our time. Thus, a good start turns into something ambiguous.\r\nTo sum up, I believe advertising as effective as other methods of product promotions. However, IT IS necessary to restrict using such videos and turn them into commercials a style that is more informative than attractive and intrusive.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion",
        "essay": "Art is a great way of communication. It helps people to express their ideas and thoughts. A segment of society is concerned that art should not be included in a school curriculum as they consider it useless. Others, however, believe the opposite. Both points of view need to be addressed before formulating an opinion.  \r\n\r\nSeemingly unimportant subjects like painting and music play a critical role in a child's development as an individual. To commence, art lessons help children to strike a balance between subjects and cope with stress. Many children at a young age enjoy drawing, thus, a school may be associated with positive emotions if they have art lessons. Secondly, the younger ones can express themselves through their paintings. More precisely, younger juveniles are not linguistic, they cannot communicate well, therefore, teachers can distinguish mental issues in their paintings and provide timely help if necessary. \r\n\r\nOn the negative side, lessons like music and painting may take time from essential subjects like math and science. Some parents believe that art occupations are paid lower compared to engineering or science. Subsequently, they want their children to focus on important subjects to have a wealthy life in the future. For instance, juveniles can learn a foreign language that they may need in their future career rather than spend one academic lesson per week painting. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I personally feel that art lessons are essential in schools. Adolescents, that are involved in creative activities become innovative individuals and creative personalities. Nevertheless, art lessons should not be provided to the detriment of other subjects.",

        "essay": "In recent years, the intrusion of robots in world life has become a matter of great concern for humans. Many people claim that robots hide some dangers while I personally oppose this idea due to their powerful support. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument and my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, robots introduce people to doubt because of several drawbacks regarding their health and uncontrolling. Firstly, modernizing automatons enable individuals to be lazier in working. Consequently, the quantity and condition of such current popular diseases as diabetes or obesity are worsened. This definitely increases the risk of symptoms or death linking to immunodeficiency illness of those patients. Secondly, uncontrollable robots also bring unpredictable outcomes for people while operating. It is the fact that if algorithms managing robots are broken, those robots will maybe operate inaccurately as programmed. As a consequence, those results in injurious actions that users hardly stopped. The world has recorded a variety of death cases relating to incorrect operating caused by uncontrolling. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, robots make massive contributions to humanity in terms of economic benefits and people’s safety. The economy can be unprosperous without robot assistance. Obviously, robot invention minimizes workforce and boosts productivity, high accuracy in manufacturing, hence, the items which are effortlessly produced via this robotic process automation are the driving force for the trade market. For this reason, those pay taxes to the government to enrich the national economy. In addition, universally, automatons are used widely to serve as effective assistants in such extreme dangerous situations for humans as checking radioactivity or demining mines. Therefore, it mitigates the unworthy casualty of staff who have to be responsible for those jobs. For instance, after the historic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 of Fukushima, the Japanese government used remote control robots to fix some radioactive leak holes in the nuclear power factory monthly. Thus, those above-mentioned utilities support me to believe that robots are a huge potential element of human life in the next decades.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that the merits exceed the demerits regarding the development globally.

However, some people think it is too late to do anything to change the situation, but other believe that we can improve it through effective measures. In my opinion, I deeply agree with this that people should realize the serious of this problem and do our best to resolve it.\r\n\r\nSome people think that protecting environment or animals is too late. It is clearly that economy is developing all over the world. That’s means lots of countries are focus on the rate of economical increasing ignore environment has been destroyed. So they think it is not useful to do anything. Some cities in China, for example, the solid has been becoming into sand because people destroyed forest to expand cities. As well as the population in these cities are raising at high speed but the plants and animals are decreasing very fast. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people believe that we can do our best to contral and change the environment we are living.

Some people opine that, gradually all the works will be replaced by the robots in the future. However, I believe that, only the repetitive work will be completed by the robots, while work which require cognitive skills and studies will not be altered by the machines.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, Human life has become easier in many ways by robots. They not only replaced the human in simple tasks, but also in dangerous and risky tasks. As automation industry has been booming. Thus the monotonous efforts have completed by the artificial perception. It is costly, but companies can surge their production, sell along with the profit. Moreover, robots have replaced the risky efforts such as to refuse the bomb, search something which is very deep in the ocean. Furthermore, it has replaced many humanitarian efforts in daily lives by applying efforts in automatic driving, surgeries, teaching and other regular household chores. It benefited people with comfort and relaxation. As per the recent survey conducted by the university, 60% of employment will be replaced by the artificial intelligence in next twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, artificial intelligence failed in positions which required cognitive job, cutting edge work and research. For Instance, the scientific research cannot be conducted by the robots because it changes as per the situation. Apart from that, the profession which includes emotions, creativity and art that must require the human touch as robots are not good in expressing the emotions. So, In other words, writer, painter, actor, psychiatrist, research and development engineer will not be replaced by the automation. To cite an example, a machine cannot give proper medication in case of the psychological patient.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, In future automation will become inevitable part of the human being as computers because the majority of the boring and less minded tasks will be taken care by the machines using artificial understanding whilst the minded and recreational profession cannot be automated.",

I personally agree on how part-time jobs for minors will bring many benefits for their future, because they will learn how to manage their time for work and play.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main reason they will benefit from part-time jobs is that they will have hands-on experience, thus increasing their hard and soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and teamwork. Many minors and recent graduates, for example, struggle to find work due to a lack of experience. They will have an early start in learning how the work field operates as a result of this. Another one is that they can help communities that are in need and grow connections. Working with the community that surrounds them will not only benefit the community but also themselves, because helping people will give us our own satisfaction and contribute to the country, starting with a smaller scope.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many adults are concerned that, because of their part-time jobs, minors will have less time to play with their friends in their spare time. But most importantly, it’s not about how the part-time job would take their time, but how minors will learn to manage their time so they can work and also live their lives as teens. A lot of part-time jobs are usually open around the summer, so they can divide their time more easily now that the school term is over.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I fully agree with how the unpaid part-time job will give more advantages to minors and the community, as long as they can balance their work and play time with friends.",

This essay will present some reasons for this and discuss the way people can check  history. \r\n\r\nMost commonly, people try to know about the past of their residence to prevent future accidents. Since there are always some possibilities to have some issues such as water leaking or broken ceilings. In this sense, people prefer to have records to protect themselves from certain problems. Added to this, some people believe in myths, so they want to go deeper about their sweet home. To illustrate, some people would avoid moving  somewhere they used to be hospitalized as they trust in ghost stories. \r\n\r\nThere are some ways to figure out the history of the house. Firstly, the public officials will provide official documents about the place. That is, people can access information easily. For example, in the city hall of Seoul, people can receive some data about the place they will move in. Secondly, it is possible to acquire information from the local community. Even though it might be not official, it could be useful, such as the characteristics of the people who used to live there.

        "essay": "The increasing life expectancy of people in developed countries can have both positive and negative consequences for individuals and society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, longer life expectancy means that people have more time to pursue their interests, spend time with loved ones, and contribute to society. It also means that people can enjoy a longer period of retirement and have more time to travel, pursue hobbies, or volunteer.\r\n\r\nHowever, longer life expectancy can also create challenges for individuals and society. One of the most significant challenges is related to healthcare and the cost of caring for an ageing population. As people live longer, they may require more medical care and support services, which can put a strain on healthcare systems and social services.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is related to the economic impact of an ageing population. As the proportion of older people in the population increases, there may be fewer people in the workforce, which can impact economic growth and sustainability. This can also place a strain on social security systems and other safety nets that provide support for the elderly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, longer life expectancy can also lead to social and cultural changes. For example, as people live longer, they may experience changes in family structures, relationships, and social norms. This can impact how society functions and how individuals interact with one another.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while longer life expectancy can be positive in many ways, it also creates challenges for individuals and society.

Others, however, believe that this would result in the loss of discipline for teachers. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.",
        "essay": "People have different views about whether students should be taught to examine and judge their high school teachers. While students’ evaluations and critiques on teachers can sometimes be useful in the educational quality, I believe this would significantly weaken teachers’ management and cause the lack of discipline for students.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is possible for high schools to upgrade teaching standards by telling children to examine and judge their teachers’ performance. When teachers know their students have opportunities to provide learning feedbacks for schools, it would largely stop inappropriate teaching behaviours, especially teachers’ bad habits, such as failing to diversify their teaching and not admitting their mistakes. This kind of approach may help to make sure what students learn is proper and sufficient, while pushing teachers to act as  role models in front of their students.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it perhaps causes much more serious consequences in high school education as it encourages students’ indiscipline. Allowing students to evaluate teachers’ performance, means that the traditional relationship between teachers and students would change. At school students should be taught to knowledge and respect their teachers. However, when teachers are afraid of receiving negative assessments and critiques which might affect their jobs, education would have to depend on students’ autonomy. This can significantly reduce their learning quality, especially when they slack off when studying. For instance, if disruptive students start to act up and distract their classmates’ studying, teachers would face the dilemma of whether to stop them or pretend not to see this. In fact, most of them are not likely to risk their career. This is why I believe high schools should not allow students to assess their teachers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I can understand why some people might want to encourage students’ evaluation of teachers, but it seems to me that this is not practical and sometimes harmful to high school education.",

Two of the possible solutions are to disconnect from the virtual world and spend some time in the real world along with indulging in some light physical activities.\r\n\r\nThese days people spend most of their time surfing social media sites and crave validation along with trying to compare their lives with others.

What can be done to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "In the century of technological advances, there is a high demand for consumer goods in the market. Therefore, many companies aim to manufacture a tremendous number of products to compete with their rival companies. However, while striving for more profit, CEOs often overlook the negative impact of production on the environment, such as greenhouse gas emissions and soil acidification. These issues can be mitigated through restrictions on the production of non-essential consumer goods and the development of an optimal recycling system.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the environment suffers from greenhouse gases - byproducts of the manufacturing process like methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases. These emissions contribute to global warming, resulting in rising sea levels, wildfires, and other natural disasters. To prevent the adverse effects of human activity, each country's production sector should limit its manufacturing levels. For instance, governments can impose restrictions on the supply of less essential consumer goods. Undoubtedly, limiting production may lead to increased inflation and potential economic crises; however, preserving nature must remain a top priority.\r\n\r\nSecondly, scraps from factories negatively affect the land and its components. Discarded waste accumulates in vast landfills, leading to soil acidification. As a result, the soil becomes unsuitable for plant growth, disrupting the ecosystem. Herbivores face food shortages (plants), and their predators, in turn, struggle to find prey due to these deaths, leading to increased competition for available resources. Consequently, the entire ecosystem suffers, eventually leading to its destruction. To address this issue, people should develop a robust recycling system, which will reduce the volume of garbage and help neutralize the soil.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, humanity is an integral part of the living ecosystem, and environmental issues directly affect our surroundings. Pursuing profit at the expense of the environment can have devastating consequences. Greenhouse gas emissions and soil acidification pose significant threats to the ecosystem. Therefore, addressing these problems by limiting production and establishing recycling facilities is of paramount importance for the well-being of future generations.",

        "essay": "Academic background and work experience are two crucial parts of getting qualified for a professional job. Whereas some people believe that getting vocational training is sufficient to secure a job, others are of the view that higher education is the only pathway to a reputable career. I completely agree with the latter opinion because, in my perspective, university education has become an eligible mandatory criterion to select efficient candidates. The justification for my stance will be further demonstrated in the lines below.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete. A university degree is a distinguishing factor in that case because the difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course, and passing final exams ensures that employers know that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence, and ability to get through the courses. Accordingly, a new report shows that a college degree continues to provide better employment prospects and higher income, as per an article published in Forbes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are some indispensable professions that require higher education over apprenticeship. The knowledge foundation and theoretical grounding in basic concepts to a high level are fundamental for those specific fields. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, engineer, or lawyer without having a relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Hence, it might be argued that work experience is just enough for some professions such as craft jobs or service work. Nevertheless, academic knowledge is a must for other high calibers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, rushing to get a job after getting your school certificate might be an eye-opener experience for a fresh graduate who has not tried to apply the theoretical knowledge they studied. Yet, in the next stage of their career path, a higher degree will always be beneficial in order to be distinguished amongst their peers. Subsequently, it is suggested that universities and higher institutions increase high-impact practices such as community learning and internships to fill this gap between theoretical life and practical life.",

I fully agree with this fact that although people can adapt themselves to climate changes, it is better to keep weather circumstances constant. In turn, this essay will discuss why preventing climate remodeling is better than finding a way of living in this situation.\r\n    On the one hand, the more climate alters, the harder life becomes. That is to say that people gained the capability to adapt themselves to the present climate within the millions of years, thus they cannot live easily with increased temperature, which happened recently. As a strategy, people can plant trees to decrease global warming, which nowadays is being converted to a serious problem. For instance, in forest countries, several kinds of cancers such as breast, brain, chest and stem cell cancers are extremely rare. In my opinion, enhancement of tree cultivation can secure the survival of planet Earth. \r\n    On the other hand, the more consumption of fossil fuels, the more changing climate. Some people declare that consumption of fossil fuels increase the atmospheric pollutants as well as the weather temperature causing several damages to the environment. Hence, for preventing climate changes, consumption of fossil fuels must be reduced. For example, in the recent decade that the weather temperature of the world became warmer by up to 2 oC, the rate of fires increased by up to 12%. I believe that consumption of fossil fuels must be reduced by humans to decreased atmospheric pollutants happens. \r\n    To summarize, some people are of the opinion that modification of climate change can happen easily, while others are opposed to this view. I am sure that preventing climate changes is better than adopting to this situation and enhancement of trees cultivation and reduction of consuming fossil fuels can help people to avoid the climate changes.",

        "essay": "Human activity  in every manifestation has a harmful effect on our planet and environment. And the very important and an integral part of our climate system are plants and animals. Everything in our ecosystem has to exist in  harmony. \r\n\r\n I believe that it is never too late to change something , and we can improve the situation if all the people  work together.  The major problem is that  many humans do not understand that they can change everything only with a few simple measures. For example, people do not have to change their lives to not disturb wildlife, they just must follow the rules like do not drop litter everywhere, use the sorting containers and in forests keep noize to a minimum and  not light a fire.\r\n\r\n I absolutely agree that we are able to change the situation with endangered species of plants and animals, if we  take effective action. Many problems with  wildlife are related to  climate change and global warming. Furthermore, it can be applied to natural disasters such as drought, flood , earthquakes  etc. These catastrophes have a harmful impact on plants and animals, but  all these casualties are caused by human activity, not just by one person. Nowadays, still   industrial companies which are not sustainable enough. They damage our environment and wildlife by exhaust fumes , dumping waste into the ocean and using fossil fuels. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the companies mislead the world about their sustainability, eco-friendly organisations such as \"Greenpeace\" can save our planet and wildlife, but if all people  work together we can improve the situation much  faster and easier.",

        "essay": "Every student who graduates from a Prestigious University wants a job in his/her respective profession. Many of them failed to get their desired Job and eventually they changed their field. There are many reasons for it which I will discuss in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a saturation of graduates in the same field and the corresponding jobs are limited. For example, every year almost 2000 chemical engineers are graduated from all the Universities in Pakistan but there are only 500 jobs available for them so what will they do in this situation? Unfortunately, they changed their profession because they do not want to waste one year. However, these kinds of problems exist in almost every country who are producing thousands of graduates with limited job opportunities. According to Higher Education Commission, almost every year 50-70% of graduates changed their profession due to not finding the desired job in their career.\r\n\r\nIn addition, before selecting the course, students should research very well the scope and saturation of all desired fields. It will not only help them to get a job in their chosen career but also make them morally strong. Government should create more and more opportunities for the graduates so that they do not get dishearted if they can not get a job. In Pakistan, these types of issues can only happen with the engineers because every year thousand of engineers are produced and only 50% of jobs are available for them. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Mostly students after graduation changed their profession because they get failed to find a job in their chosen career. These types of problems can be solved by creating more opportunities for graduates.",

        "prompt": "Only government action can solve the housing shortage in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "In recent years, the issue of insufficient housing in big cities has become increasingly prominent in many different parts of nations. Some people argue that only governments can tackle this issue. I strongly agree with this view, and I will explain my reasons below.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the housing shortage is closely related to the population in cities, and governments are uniquely positioned to implement policies to address this problem. For example, the Chinese government has levied taxes on intercity migration since the early 1990s in order to control the number of citizens contributing to the housing shortage. Additionally, the real estate market, which has a significant impact on the scarcity of houses, is largely controlled by governments and official departments, not by private individuals. Seoul, the capital city of Korea, is a prime example of this, as the government strictly restricts people from investing in the housing market.\r\n\r\nWhile some may argue that individuals can take actions such as moving to suburban areas, this only addresses the initial factor of the housing shortage. The primary reason people live in cities is because of the availability of qualified job opportunities and proper infrastructure, which cannot be found in suburban or rural areas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that only governments can effectively address the issue of insufficient housing in big cities. Given the significant impact of the population and the real estate market on this issue, it is essential that governments take the lead in implementing policies and strategies to solve the problem.",

        "essay": "Due to the escalating pollution and huge population, healthy food is a great concern for many. While healthcare budget for the government is increasing each year, the public health condition, on the contrary, is deteriorating. Some opine that the government needs to pass laws regarding food intake to improve the public health, while others oppose this idea as they believe that it is a matter of individual choice. The following paragraphs will shed some light on this debate before drawing a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, healthy lifestyle is a choice and habit of an individual. No matter how many laws are passed and how strictly the government monitors the food quality, if a person does not follow the healthy lifestyle and eating habit, he will surely suffer from health related issues. Thus the choices of individuals greatly affect the overall health condition of a nation. To lead a healthy life citizens do not need expensive food, gym facilities, expert dieticians and so on. For instance, the rich population of a country suffers from obesity, diabetics and many other diseases that are less frequent among the middle-class people. This proves that purchasing ability and budget are not the most important aspect of a healthy life.  \r\n\r\nOn the other side, use of chemicals, preservatives and adhesives in food items should be totally banned and only the government can ensure that. Even after having proper diet and exercise, if people are forced to eat foods that have unexpected chemicals, they would suffer from dangerous diseases. Using unauthorised chemicals, selling expired and low-quality food should be forbidden. Infrequent market monitoring and the lack of quality control for food items are two reasons our market is full of unhygienic food items. The government's initiative can greatly reduce this unexpected corruption and crime in the food industry and market.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the citizens of a country have to practise a healthy lifestyle while the government should ensure the hygiene in food production and food sells. Both of their combined initiatives and efforts can greatly promote the public health.",

Personally, I agree with the first statement. This essay would mention both view.\r\n\r\nIt is fact that studying at university is the shortest way to be suceesful. And people who go to university would have more opportunities to get a quality job. A quality degree from a good university will help people find it easier to find a job and get high salaries. Although studying at university will lack of experiences, students in university make good friends and communicate with people of the same levels. Specially, almost parents want their child go to university to have more knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people believe that get a job immediately after graduating from high school  instead of go to university. Due to the fact that start to work after graduate can accumulation more experience than spend four years in university and have many relationships. However, very few businesses want to recruitment an employee who do not have standard and degree. In addition, Insufficient professional knowledge, people just get a job with low salaries than a labour from university.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, find a job after graduating from high school would have more experience and can earn money soon, but they cannot find a quality job with high salaries like university graduates.

I completely agree with the above statement so I will explain my opinion using examples from the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. \r\n\r\nYoungsters´ participation in unpaid work influences them positively. I will begin with that involving teenagers in volunteering activities converts them to be good-oriented adults in the future. In addition, taking responsibility for these kinds of helping works capable to teach many qualifications, for instance, leadership, task performance, and being more disciplined. As an example, During the UK school children’s gap year, they often volunteer to take after the elderly who need help. Also, Research confirmed the immense impacts of this on improving the participated candidates’ kindness, caring, patience and humility. \r\n\r\nMoreover, teenagers’ volunteer work can empower the development of the communities. Because of having busy teens will end up reducing the number of crimes, robberies, unethical involvements, and sexual harassment. As a piece of evidence, in 2000, criminal activities and rape cases went down immensely, subsequently, after adopting the idea of encouraging Sri Lanka 10-grade- school students to volunteer throughout summer vacation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is crystal clear that teenagers’ involvement in unpaid work positively affects them and the community as well. Teenagers often enrich their qualities and experience because of taking part in the volunteer industry.

        "essay": "There is a dilemma among the people of whether museums should be merely  entertaining places, or they have to be locations that can bring opportunities to learn and study. While individuals can be entertained by visiting museums, I do not see eye-to-eye with those who assert that these places should be only for fun. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people claim that there are many enjoyable factors in the museums, which turn them into an entertaining site. They believe that in these places, families can pass their leisure time perfectly, as a great deal of amenities and services are being provided to them. In other words, when entering a museum, families are able to find foods, drinks, and even toys for their children at reasonable prices. Moreover, they can sit and rest in the rooms, playing short films about different civilizations or historical places, and simultaneously have conversations and laugh to each other's jokes. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in terms of cultural perspective, the ideal goal of museums is to educate people. This means, the government fund a great deal of money collected from taxpayers to extend and develop these cultural locations, in the means of transferring cultural values among people. By studying different items in a museum, not only can visitors become familiar with history and civilizations of different countries, but they can also have a fascinating leisure time. That is the reason why the busiest tourist attractions of a city are its museums. Travellers are eager to know about the national heritage and cultural values, thus they are attracted to these places. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, considering mentioned compelling reasons, in my point of view, the role of a museum is higher than to be just enjoyable and entertaining. People are able to use other places to have fun and they have to leave the museums for those who really want to learn from its contents.",

        "essay": "In my opinion, the government should increase the cost of fuel for vehicles to solve environmental problems such as air pollution and traffic on the roads. Nowadays, Cars become one of the important things in our day-to-day lifestyle, instead of driving two-wheelers people prefer to drive four-wheelers for nearby locations because they feel a car is safer than bikes.\r\n\r\nSince, we have gas stations side-by-side it's convenient to travel in car with family everywhere along with language. In case, government increase the petrol price, there are some chance to solve environmental problems. Although, people who travel to office daily should start using vehicles like cycle if it's nearby. Whereas, riding cycle will help to improve our health rather driving cars, however, if it's a walkable distance then walking to the workplace is advisable so that they can bypass wasting time in traffic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the government raises the fuel cost then there will be some impact on car manufacturing companies. It seems to me that, fuel price is directly propositional to car company because if there is a increase in the price of gas then buying cars will automatically get reduced. For instance, we may expect people to prefer a cycle for the accessible location which is good for their health as well. \r\n\r\nTo my mind, environmental problems such as traffic, accidents can be solved by raising the price of petrol, diesel and gas. Government should think and act accordingly, unless there are some strict rules and regulations that have been issued by the government people will not change on their own. Hence, to control atmosphere air pollution fuel cost raise is mandatory by the government.",

First, it can cause some physical problems, for example, weak eyesight, unhealthy backbones, and leg problems. Second, computers are a new trend for most parents. It is hard for them to accept a new item, opposite to what they are used to playing with in the old time. Finally, indeed, PC plays need more supervision. The internet environment prevents parents from allowing their children to play. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are several reasons why I think we should not deny computer plays completely.

In this essay, not only the possible reasons that lead these people to perform these actions will be discussed but also how they can do the research.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is commonly believed that the major reason is fear, since they may live in a place where there might be a high crime rate, the person surely will investigate whether the site where he lives is safe or not, no human being wishes to live in a dangerous place. Secondly, another factor that may contribute to this research is the structural problem the building may face in the future, mainly if it is not a new built-place.

        "essay": "People have different views about whether we are more or less  dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be  more independent than people were in the past.  There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more  dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult,  especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For  example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying  a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would  be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage.  Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want  a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents  usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from  grandparents and babysitters for child care.  However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more  independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming  smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on  relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel  and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students  choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this  experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone.  Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows  us to work alone and from any part of the world.

        "essay": "There have been numerous debatable arguments about whether high school learners should be spurred to make comments or even criticize their educators with the aim of improving educational quality or not. While there are some advocates of the latter idea because of educators’ loss of motivation, I believe that it is better for students to give their own points of view, and even judge their teachers because teachers’ strengths and weaknesses can be identified.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the option to prevent students from expressing opinions and evaluating their teachers is reasonable to some extent because it might create a sense of disrespect and discipline. Given the fact that high school students are generally immature, inexperienced and impulsive; thereby, they are more likely to give emotional feedback, which can trigger a breakdown in student-teacher relationships. As a consequence, the lessons are easily interrupted and cause chaos in the class, which will reduce the learning quality of the lectures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that an acceptance for students to give their own viewpoints and evaluate their schoolteachers is beneficial because teachers’ strengths and weaknesses can be identified. When educators receive honest feedback from their students, they can easily realize whether their lectures and pedagogical skills go well or not; therefore, they can learn from that feedback to improve their teaching methodology to suit students’ needs. To illustrate, the PISA English Center has a weekly report form for students to give their notion on their teachers or other things related to their studies in order to find a suitable approach to help students achieve their targets. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some maintain that a freely discussed learning environment should not be spurred owing to schoolteachers’ loss of motivation, I am more convinced that this kind of class model should be developed in the foreseeable future because educators can identify their own strengths and weaknesses, which help them have a better performance in later lectures.",

Some believe that studying international news can be a valuable addition to the school curriculum, while others argue that it is a waste of precious school time. In my opinion, secondary school children should study international news as a school subject.\r\n\r\nFirstly, studying international news helps students to develop a global perspective and understand the world beyond their own community. It exposes them to different cultures, perspectives, and challenges, and helps them to become more informed and empathetic global citizens. This can be particularly important in today's interconnected world, where events in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences.\r\n\r\nSecondly, studying international news can also help students to develop critical thinking skills. They can learn to analyze news stories, assess the credibility of sources, and evaluate the potential impact of events. This can be a valuable preparation for their future careers, where they will be expected to make informed decisions based on information from a variety of sources.\r\n\r\nFinally, incorporating international news into the school curriculum can be a way to encourage students to become interested in current events and stay informed throughout their lives.

However, as there are advantages, I believe, there are a plethora of drawbacks to society and in this essay, I will emphasize my opinion with examples.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, many jobs in the modern world require not only skills and experience but also human empathy and creativity. For example, the professions in the aged care category have to deal with adults who need love and affection and also, and caring should be done gently. If robots play the role of a carer those machinery cannot succeed in their work as humans. Moreover, automated Professionals cannot handle aggressive residents in care settings as they only have repetitive skills, and not the creativity to handle situations.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, If all job types are invaded by robots, it can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate in the country. For instance, if a company is fully automated from the labor to management post, which previously had a full human labor force, those workers should go for other options to find jobs and to make their living. As a result of joblessness, many negative impacts will arise in the community like rising crime rates, shoplifting, and also, causing depression as people are always in stressful conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are disadvantages, introducing robots has several positive impacts too. Additionally, in my mind, I believe human-AI collaboration can lead to a plus mark in the modern job market rather than converting human force to Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people believe AI will replace human labor, but it cannot be done as the authorities know the consequences of that on citizens and the way it indirectly impacts the government.",

        "prompt": "67.Some people say that governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "It is argued that the government should give more importance to reduce pollution and housing problems, so health problems can be avoided. This essay completely agrees with this statement because pollution leads to respiratory diseases and inadequate housing can cause illnesses.\r\n\r\nPollution problems are increasing every year. This is because of the activities that humans carry out, more and more diseases are discovered that are linked to air pollution, when the amount of pollution increases, people’s lives in danger rise too, and the most common problems are related to the respiratory system. Recent research concluded that in the last decades, there has been an increase in asthma cases, and many people are getting lung problems, and there are still no solutions for some diseases. \r\n\r\nInadequate type of housing can cause health problems for all people who live there. Overcrowding is the biggest problem in most countries, this causes that if one of the individuals that is in the house has an infectious disease the others have a high probability to be infected too. Also, people can get mental health problems, such as psychological stress and sleeping problems, which in the long term period will lead to more serious issues. A recent study found that, more and more people are going to the phycologist because they are having sleeping problems, after studying the cases, the experts concluded that most of them were living with too many people which caused them to be mentally stressed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government should look for solutions to both pollution and housing problems, so the number of diseases related to these causes can be reduced.",

        "essay": "It is often said that nowadays about important community jobs and an active actions from young people. From my point of view, I partly agree with this point and explain the reasons for this in the below essay. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the teenagers must to respect their society and government. There is no denying, these people having a lot of free time and their study not use a full day from young boys and girls. For example, in different educational centres a time of study have borders and your students can be free after lessons or lectures. We all know students which love an open air, to walk in different public spaces. This situation about teenager's free time will very help to society. Therefore, they can to do community work.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the above point, most of them young folks want to relax at the their liberty hours. Study is hard and in today's modern world life is very rapid, stream and unusual. This makes it clear why teenagers want using free time for fun, relax and conversation with friends or parents. For instance, a parents which gave the chance their children for education in foreign city, their son or daughter very wants to use free time for conversation parents and doing the community work instead.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I partly agree with this idea. In my opinion, each teenager should to help the society and his city, but he should get paid for this help. And young people's liberty time they are can use as they want.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are showing more interest towards the history of their accommodations. So what are the main reasons behind this phenomenon and what are the different ways in which people could make some research ?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are multiple factors motivating house owners to dig deeper into the history of their buildings. Firstly, old housing is often characterized by unusual architecture that is particular to a certain era, holding an enriching past. Secondly, many individuals are concerned about the durability of their house structures due to the continuous climate change that might affect them, which leads to better maintenance of the place. For example, many authorities force house owners to provide a report about the quality of the building structure in order to prevent damage.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the most useful way to research and investigate  the past of accommodations is by locally asking neighbours and residents about it. In other words, these latest have more reliable information about the surroundings than the internet as they have lived there and experienced the changes that might have happened. For instance, many people choose to visit the local residents before buying properties in order to get truthful reviews. Furthermore, using the knowledge available on the internet might be useful too.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it is important to seek the maximum of information from the local neighbours because it is useful to find out about the history and past of buildings as it contributes to the overall historical knowledge and preserves the durability of certain buildings.",

        "essay": "As the 21st century continues to unfold, it is easy to face various types of advertisements from every area on a daily basis . From my point of view, I suppose the drawbacks of this development outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\n Undeniably, advertisements still have a good side and they also bring certain profits. In the first place, they can be used as a way of recreation. For instance, in Vietnam, parents often open commercials which have catchy songs or sound to calm their kids down. Plus, Thai commercials with hilarious content are becoming more trendy on social media; accordingly, they help people let people’s hair down after a day burying their heads into work. Apart from that, advertisements can support people to approach new information effortlessly. To justify this, people are bombarded by countless  advertisements such as commercials, billboards, posters, etc on a daily basis. Thus, it is much easier for individuals to focus on informative aspects in each advertisement.\r\n\r\n Nevertheless, citizens admit that the disadvantages of advertisements outweigh the advantages. One compelling fact is that  most advertisements on the Internet affect users’ privacy. For example, Facebook sells personal information for advertising purposes. Additionally, commercials appear on all devices  and they make users feel annoyed because they are such time-consuming things. Furthermore, nowadays, there are manifold inappropriate advertisements. To illustrate, they can mislead people who are duplicitous and then steal their money. Moreover, some advertisements can also affect kids by ruining children’s minds with inappropriate content and images.\r\n\r\nTaking a glance at the previous points, advertisements provide both benefits and drawbacks for humans. Notwithstanding, I regard the development of advertisements still brings more disadvantages for society.",

This essay will delve into the upcoming paragraph and subsequently will explore perspective in turns.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I believe the government should definitely allocate a large part of its budget to public work. The economic sector determines the overall quality of life, ensuring basic sectors such as schools, hospitals and roads are available to all the citizens irrespective of their income and social status. The population needs  civil work. thus proper funds are needed\r\n\r\nFor example, the absence of medicine in any country will create significant problems. That's why the ministry should adequately finance  public services in the first place. Becoming old is a normal thing for everyone however younger population participate an important role in the country's economic growth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, retired adults are a vital part of  every family. Who encourage their close  as well as provides their experiences. I think adults must save their funds during their working times. However old people are also an integral side of the nation. Some ancient can save their money but most of the old population could not save money because of the high expenses. I think the state should provide free medicines and treatments for low-income citizens.\r\n\r\nFor instance,  Sri Lanka provides pensions for old citizens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic,  I believe the ministry should allocate a large amount of its budget for argent needs.\r\n\r\nHowever old society is also a crucial part of  society.

To elaborate, it is a traditional way that people from the past until now in order to get the news and people can know exactly about detailed information of it.

Therefore, people can base on it to get the news without confusion whether the new is true or not.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is media that allow people to get the news.

        "essay": "It is hard to deny that advertising from competing companies can impair consumers' consumption concepts as advertisements always trying to persuade people to purchase expensive but maybe unsuitable products. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that advertising is harmful to consumers, and  should be censored or even controlled by the government. However, such a statement suffers from logical and factual fallacies and should be examined meticulously. As far as the economy, employment, and consumption concept are concerned, I firmly hold that advertisements can be beneficial to society and the community, and false or harmful information should be censored by the government.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the advertising industry provides employment, as it has become a creative industry that gives profitable jobs to many people. To be more specific, advertising has become a modern art and many universities or colleges have this subject, providing many graduates for companies or celebrities to advertise and increase their influence. In addition, there are many job vacancies as almost all companies need to advertise their products to consumers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the fact that advertising can boost sales of one company or product, improving the  economy indicates that it can be beneficial. For example, take the case of YeShu, a well-known milk company famous for its quality and good taste: huge investment in advertising makes people associate its brand image with high quality, good taste, and even making people smart. As a result, more and more consumers know and buy its products. Had it not been for its impressive and attractive advertisement, YeShu would need have become one of the largest companies in the drinking industry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a voice arises that advertising is always trying to manipulate people to consume more and has influenced many people even children to develop a bad consumption concept. Ironically, though advertising is trying to persuade consumers to buy more, people can not be easily manipulated. For instance, consumers can see comments and reviews from other consumers, and advertisements that boost too much can easily find out.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I maintain that foreign visitors should pay more as such a policy is feasible to implement, and benefits our national culture and economy. Admittedly, as my favourite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues to fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.

        "essay": "Staying healthy is strongly linked to eating nutritious food, which depends upon making correct food choices. Many people hold the opinion that the government should be liable for the implementation of laws regarding the supply of healthy food, while others claim that it's an individual's preference to eat healthy or unhealthy food. This essay will discuss both ideas in detail and will highlight why individuals should decide whether they want to adopt healthy dietary habits or not.\r\nMany people believe that the responsibility of sustaining public health lands on the shoulders of the government, mainly because the government has the power to control the excessive use of food that is harmful to its consumers. For instance, the government can put high taxes on the sales of carbonated drinks, tobacco, or other junk items; it would ultimately reduce the consumption of these elements. It would also provide an additional advantage of cutting down of public health costs. \r\nHowever, limiting the availability of food variety would imbibe a feeling of freedom restriction in the citizens, which would lead to resentment and protest among the nationals of a country. Secondly, it would affect the economy of the major industries supplying these junk items. As a consequence, the overall economy of the country would be in question. A better option, to encourage local people toward healthy food, would be to mount awareness programs regarding appropriate food selection and the dangerous effects of consuming an unhealthy meal.  \r\nTo conclude, although the government can make laws and put taxes to improve the dietary habits of its citizens, a healthy population and reduction of health funds are not the only outcomes of it.  It could lead to unfavorable social impact and maybe an overall loss of the economic state of a country. Hence, in my opinion, the choice of eating healthy stuff should be left up to well-informed individuals.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, people tend to delay the time of having children more than in the past. The reason could relative to the perspective of social burden and financial problems, and I will discuss the disadvantage of this trend from the aspect of age and nursing problems.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the social burden is part of the reason for the question. People are more likely to build up their career and success to satisfy  their security in society. In this case, they are more willing to spend time at work rather than having a child to earn as much as possible. Without the insurance of finance, people are hard to raise children and give them an appropriate life. Secondly, Having children means another burden for life expenditure since it needs to deal with the cost from nursing, previous education and illness. Having children in their later age based on a solid financial foundation could be a choice for those people.\r\n\r\nHowever, having children at a later age can increase the risk during  pregnancy. Scientists had already approved that women over 35 who are pregnant have a large chance to lose their baby during their pregnancy. The risk also shows in their children who are more likely to suffer from various diseases such as disorders, which makes the disadvantage of raising a child in older age more obviously. Moreover, those old age parents could face another problem is a lack of patience and energy for caring for a child, since the physical problems start to emerge with the ageing. The potential risk in their parents could cost a huge amount of time to keep and maintain the health rather than spend time on children. \r\n\r\nOverall, I believe that people have a child at a later age because of the social burden and financial problems. and this trend could be disadvantages more than it is advantages. due to  age and nursing problems.",

For instance, considering the internet,  it has revolutionized the way of living by providing access to any information within a matter of seconds. This is especially very helpful for students to improve their knowledge from the comfort of their homes. Additionally, people are now able to connect with their families and loved ones no matter how far they are located anytime easily.

        "essay": "Alleviating the dire state of the environment and housing shortages is thought to be attributable to the prevention of illness and diseases. In this essay, I will offer many compelling reasons why I hold the same viewpoint. \r\n\r\nIt is justifiable to state that encountering environmental problems would culminate in the decrease of health issues. To illustrate, many respiratory problems are triggered conclusively by air pollution, while water contamination is believed to be a primary culprit behind digestive issues and skin cancer. Hence, if these pressing environmental issues were mitigated, the rate of people suffering such diseases would decrease as well, leaving the governments with tolerable welfare burdens such as funding patients' meditations and treatments to shoulder.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some also argue that fewer people would be infected by contagious diseases provided that accommodation issues are dealt with, and justifiably so. In fact, due to the unaffordability of housing, many people, especially those living under the poverty line, have been forced to reside in dilapidated zones with no access to clean water. Such an unhygienic living environment primarily firstly sets out optimum conditions for the outbreak of digestive diseases including diarrhea, and secondly provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes - the carrier of malaria. Therefore, people can be safeguarded from these aforementioned health issues when being able to live in a better living environment, and the governments may also benefit financially from the mitigation of housing problems, as seen above. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I opine that both the governments and ordinary people can reap benefits regarding health and finance if human and financial resources are allocated to address environmental and housing problems.",

As far as this argument goes, I strongly support the viewpoint for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, It goes without saying that admiring those bad models may turn teenagers into pragmatists. Indeed, by being influenced by those big shots, the youth will have a tendency to judge other people by their looks and their possessions rather than their talents. For instance, my friend Duy said that he only made friends with people who had good outfits or looked rich and fancy. Given his stance, Duy was boycotted by his classmates and he ended up having no friends for his entire high school years.   \r\n\r\nFurthermore, those bad celebrities will inculcate bad outlooks into victims’ feeble minds. Apparently, teenagers will embrace the idea of spending money haphazardly due to watching their idols, depriving them of insights into the importance of money.

In my opinion, certain technological innovations are available to all people in the society and make contributions to bridging the wealth gap, nevertheless, certain innovations are inaccessible to poor because of their high cost.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people think that certain innovation and discoveries play an integral role in filling the gap between different income levels. This is because they are accessible to all people among different social class due to their easy availability at cheaper rates. For instance, the internet technology is available to almost all sections of the society. It is affordable to all the people and certain places such as railway station, bus station and airport are wifi hotspots where the internet is freely available. Besides this, modern technologies have provided great opportunities for the poor to get rich. For example, the internet has already made many people become billionaire by setting their own commercial website. Compared to traditional industries, which require large initial investment and higher operational costs. Hence, the internet is much better and cheaper platform to make fortune for people from all social backgrounds.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many people argued that certain advancements in technology is not affordable for the poorer sections of the society. Modern medicines, for example, is expensive. Certain new drugs and diagnostic procedures are very costly.

Rich people can access these treatments by spending only a small amount of their income and improve their health. Poor people, on the other side, have to spend all of their money for conventional treatment and yet there is no guarantee of returning to a state of good health. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although some claim that modern technology magnifies the gap between the rich and the poor, I strongly believe that it could narrow the difference between social classes.",

        "essay": "Most people marry at later age, so they decided to have children at later. In this case, there are few reasons are working behind this changing societal norms and priorities.\r\n\r\nCareer and financial stability is the main reason of this changing norms. Now-a-days, it is very tough to get a job, because one student needs to pass different steps of educational systems. Later, they need to have work experience to get a good job with a good salary. Salary or financial stability stands in their way of marriage life. In our society, especially male, if they are not well established with good salary and financially support, it is very tough for them to marry someone. So, getting established takes time, for this reason, one married couple have children in later age. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is choosing career path, and emotional and psychological readiness in one person. Someone choose career path than marriage life. one earns higher degrees of educational certificates later they get married. On the other hand, if they earn higher degrees of certificates then they are looking someone who will match their choice. This is the another reason which is now prevailing trend in our society. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of having children of later age is than one can get enough time to settle themselves so that in future to support ones children would be easier for them. Some early marriage in not well-established family and having children, is sometimes very challenging in this decade. And later it causes mental challenges for parents.On the other hand, disadvantages of late children is also not good for some couple, because uncontrolled uses birth control pills, intake not well defined food diet also responsible for this problem. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is must to say that, marriage is an important part of one's life, it was easy in early ages but in this decade it seems getting tough. So I would tell, changing in societal pattern could make easier our life for getting married.",

        "essay": "To commence with, the most important effect of economic flourish is deforestation. Many enormous international or local factories and companies are demanding large hectares of land for their various sort of developments such as building a new construction site of the new products. This has only one solution and that is sacrificing jungles and farms for the term which is called economic growth. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the economy expands and power growth is parallel with each other. In other words, the authorities who are in charge of applying these economical changes with the endless power have been given to them. A recent study illustrates that half of the local farming land in India has been taken by company owners. That same study also linked the percentage of poverty caused by this action which was more than 40 %.\r\n\r\nFlip side of the coin, some say economic growth could magically vanish poverty. Economic developments tend to be a major factor of increasing local citizens' revenue by creating new ways of earning money for them. Take Maldives as an instance, the country which flourished with tourism economy growth. As mass tourism helped the locals to lessen society poverty by renting their homes to tourists. Besides, economical advancement may open the international markets for the countries which perhaps could make a significant change in the poverty rate of the citizens by trading different goods with other nations and getting the huge profit of them directly. For example, many Iranian citizens sell hand-made Termeh in international markets with a considerable amount of profit margin.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there is a debate about poverty. Some opinions claim that poverty may harm our environment by developing the economy and some think this notion does not have any negative side and contains various benefits for vanishing the poverty without harming our habitat.",

In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement and I am going to elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, job satisfaction is considered to be a major contributor to office's enthusiasm, due to the fact that doing what you love makes your activities or test easier and more interesting. In other words, it gives you the feeling of pleasure, which can help you get rid of stress got in the workplace. Take my mother as an example, she is an elementary school teacher and has been teaching English for over 30 years. Although she only earned a little money, she took delight in it. Because she really likes to teach children and was also highly respected by her students. As a consequence, satisfaction plays a significant role in putting more effort into performance.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the atmosphere at work is also one of the crucial causes to be in the workplace. Working with friendly colleagues and a well boss can boost employees' confidence and happiness  because it creates a comfortable working environment without coworker pressure. For example, despite my workplace being extremely far from my home, my colleagues are so kind that I decided to stay and work with them. Therefore, people ignore unpleasant factors when they are working in a great team.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, cash motivates a part of society to work.

        "essay": "Nowadays, the production of consumer goods results in more and more harmful to the environment than ever. This damage is due to the high levels of consumption and the use of certain kinds of energy, such as petroleum and coal.\r\n\r\nIn the modern world, people are induced, by advertisements, to buy things that they do not need. Actually, we buy more products than  it is really necessary to survive or get a comfortable life. This behaviour generates high demand for some types of products like mobile phones, cars, clothes, and electronic gadgets, for example, which generate high levels of garbage, when it is disposable. Moreover, the production of these goods results in several damage to nature because they need huge amounts of energy. Quite often, this energy is generated by sources which increase the pollution and contamination of rivers, oceans, and air. As a result, this pollution can kill many species of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, the government and public authorities worldwide should control and restrict the use of some sorts of energy, stimulating the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and biofuel. Furthermore, all  nations should make stricter laws and inspect  compliance, applying fines to the companies and countries that fail to comply. Another action that could be done, is to promote the reusable of products and changes in consumption patterns.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the production of consumer goods at elevated levels is very harmful to life on the planet.

However, others claim that it is better to join work right after schooling. In my opinion, studying at college provides more exposure to every student in starting their career in a particular field. Whereas, school won't gives this space for the same. This essay will substantiate both views in my opine in the following paragraphs with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly, employment is necessary for every student where an university plays a crucial role for  providing a wide range of opportunities to all the graduates. It allows placements from different companies that gives graduates to improve their skills and help them in getting jobs. Moreover, it encourage students in acquring the practical knowledge and indulge them in field projects where they expose themselves to real world and be confident face the society. For example, students who graduated from college working in reputated company because they have skills and ability to learn in their job. Thus, studying at college help young people in shaping their career.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people think students should start employment once they completed  their schooling. Despite having less practical knowledge, students work out of enthusiasm. This provides them to grasp the knowledge as their mind acts on high pace. Furthermore, they start earning at their early age if they start working right after school, which helps them to be independent. According to the recent survey, a girl working in an industry who just completed matriculation, support her family with her income.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although employment after schooling is interesting, studying at college always essential to mold a student career in achieving their desired jobs.

In my opinion, a museum can serve dual purposes, although education tends to play a larger part. \r\n\r\n           With regard to educational purposes, museums teach us about the rich history through exhibitions and valuable tour guides. It means that people can learn about antiques, compare them with present translations and even predict future alternatives.For instance ,usually there are many trips at high schools to various museums to keep up with innovative learning methods during teaching subjects like art, and history.In the capital of  Kazakhstan,  tourists and just people who desire to visit the  National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan are demonstrated with historical exhibits in order to study in detail the past of Kazakh ethnicity.  It would be the most efficient way to draw people’s attention to yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Turning to the aims of entertainment, it is evident that museums do not have profit-making activities. Many museums therefore sought to operate more activities to attract more visitors, in order for an additional entry fee to cover costs.For instance, “The Museum of Tomorrow” is a science museum which is full of amusing and educational  details at the same time. Hence, museums can be an appealing way to spend spare time as a result of holding recreational events at the expense of balancing a budget.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, visiting  museums’ standards were altered, and divided into two options(educational and recreational). Personally, I suppose that visiting them for research purposes is more beneficial than spending time for fun.",

A section of society believes that the fuels and vehicles rate should be kept high to cut the intensity of pollution by the law enforced agencies. Although the need for transportation is a need of the hour in the contemporary world, I think it should be restricted by some measures to resolve the problem and the reasons for my opinion will be elucidated in the forthcoming paragraphs with suitable illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe major significant role of travelling through different means of transport is people find it comfortable and these days they do not have enough time to commute by other environmental safe vehicles due to hectic schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a plethora of reasons as to why the cost of fuels should be increased. The prominent one is that the crowd will reduce the unnecessary journeys after uplifting the fuel cost to spend an inordinate amount of money on exorbitant taxes. For example, The Tribune has published that 60% of youngsters are found on roads in their private vehicles to just explore cities in their leisure time. Consequently, it is just a squandering of resources that are to be minimized by the high authorities.\r\n\r\nMoreover, by hiking the prices of vehicles, the government will be bound to refurbish the condition of public transportation which leads to gravitate folks towards them to travel to distinct places with less pecuniary resources. Metro, for example, In Delhi, majority of the population prefer to travel by trains to spend less money rather than driving by their personal cars.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, despite the fact that the use of automobiles is necessary for each individual, In my perspective,  government officials should make stringent rules towards the usage of fuels and increase taxes for purchasing vehicles so that the community may realize the repercussions of their waste.",

From my point of view, the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it cannot be deniable that the environment plays an indispensable role in our daily lives. For the most part, given all nations are inexorably connected financially and politically, wealthier countries may provide poorer countries with ecologically linked aid in order to slow down their unrestrained industrialization. Whatever the outcomes of these activities, collective global efforts have a significant influence on individual consciousness, prompting people to act ecologically responsibly. Furthermore, by exchanging creative ideas, international collaboration might enable scientists to start research seminars. These measures, for instance, will create additional clean energy such as wind and solar in order to address significant environmental issues.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, globalization also improves world business to a large extent in terms of the economy. For one, international collaboration will allow various countries to leverage their own advantages in order to maximize their economic growth potential. Taking China as an example, the country's large population draws more labour-intensive businesses such as manufacturing, resulting in more employment possibilities. Additionally, enhanced international trade operations can provide individuals with greater access to high-quality foreign items, thus improving their living standards and sense of satisfaction. On account of that, the growing international collaboration will eventually help the global economy.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I believe that whereas international collaboration may result in certain environmental efforts, it is the corporate sector that gains the most from the progress.",

        "essay": "In this contemporary epoch, the debate over whether or not customs and traditions have become irrelevant to this fast-paced life has become a controversial argument. Whilst some proponents emphasize that such  preservation serves cultural identity, I personally believe that nations' cultural heritage requires amelioration for the sake of better relations within nations and families. In this essay, 2 of the primary reasons why I totally agree with the need for a change in traditional ways of thinking will be further elaborated.\r\n\r\nTo embark on, first and also the most crucial reason relates to the fact that inherited traditions have become an obstacle that hinders different people from various ethnic backgrounds from socializing. In other words, if every nation tends to preserve its customs, the world will suffer from global wars ,particularly in this digitalized life where the obstacles between countries have blurred. This can be witnessed by different social media platforms which permitted such fast transactions of information between various nations around the world. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in addition to the previously-mentioned benefits, the undue keeping of inherited traditions gives rise to conflicts among families since the current generation has a completely different way of thinking as a result of the wide availability of cutting-edge electronics. This means that when breadwinners start to change their obsolete thoughts, they will communicate more efficiently with their minors. One particularly salient example of this is parenting courses in which guardians are taught how to get rid of their old thoughts and become equipped and updated with the latest information.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that not only does the superfluous preservation of ethics worsen the communication among tribes but also this occurs within families.

I completely agree that it is better that prisoners receive the education rather than letting them unemployed once they are out of prison.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is vital to the people in jail to receive a better education as they deserve to seize a second chance in the life. Therefore, this opportunity will give them a new hope to redeem their dark past in order to be more succesful people, as well as to mend some low minded society that people cannot be succeed provided that they have a criminal record.

If any individual throw any kind of waste on the streat, this will have a huge impact on the environment. if someone throw a plastic bottel for example, it might take thousands of years for the plastic to resolve. Instead people should have the knowledge about where they should throw their waste and always look for a recycle baskets.

Personally, I contend that the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend.\r\n\r\nOne the one hand, when the world becomes a global village, environmental protection turns out to be a common concern and is addressed on a global scale. Kyoto Protocol, which is an international treaty that imposes limitations on CO2 emissions on member nations, helps to reduce a significant amount of the gas into the atmosphere. Were this treaty not brought to life by concerted efforts of many nations, our carbon footprint would be much greater and the damage we did to our planet would be more severe. Moreover, given countries are inexorably linked to each other economically and politically, the wealthier ones could introduce environmentally linked aid to poorer countries with a view to curb their uncontrolled paces of industrialization. Whatever the results of these practices, at least collective attempts made worldwide brings a great impact on individual consciousness, which prompts individuals to act environmentally responsibly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that economic prosperity is the main by-product of global integration. Thanks to an increasingly free global market, a number of undeveloped nations are being lifted out of poverty through either exporting their strengths or foreign investments. This is not likely to happen in times of political isolation had been the norm since the flows of goods, money, and humans were limited within national boundaries or regional borders. Furthermore, global cooperation enables transnational or international corporations to locate their manufacturing facilities on the other side of the world where cheap and abundant labours could make a huge difference in price production, leaving them an edge over their rivals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think, even though international cooperation could bring about some initiatives regarding environmental preservation it is the world of business that benefits most from the development.",

        "essay": "Unemployment among young people is an ongoing and increasing situation in many countries around the world. The fact that students cannot find jobs after graduation is the cause of certain complications and can be addressed/solved/tackled/resolved using several methods .\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a huge number of issues related to young jobless people on a personal as well as community level. Firstly, in terms of finance, young people cannot generate income unless they have a career. Becoming financially dependent, they can face a lot of difficulties in maintaining their daily life. Also, they may become a burden to their own family, especially their parents who have to work harder and harder to cover their expenses instead of enjoying old age. Moreover, workless people are one of the reasons that make social evils more serious. A person without a job usually spends most of the time doing nothing, which makes it easy for them to engage in wrongdoing such as robbery, theft, and drug addiction. \r\n\r\nTo minimize and partially solve this problem,  education for the younger generations as well as government action are the most important. First of all, schools should equip students with practical skills and organize career orientation sessions for students. By doing this, it can be easier for them to find jobs after graduation. Also, motivating and encouraging students to participate in vocational training after leaving school for both studying and earning an income can help ease the problem. Furthermore, the government should promote the operation of local career and job placement centres. The activities of these centres should be propagated so that young people can easily access more job information.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, unemployment among young people today is a serious situation and affects both themselves and society as a whole, but this can be tackled with proper education from schools and assistance from the government.",

        "prompt": "Although families have influence on children’s development, factors outside the home play a bigger part in their lives nowadays.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "There is a growing public opinion that even though parents have an undeniable impact on the evolution of children, activities away from the family play a bigger role. I partially agree with this notion because juveniles spend most of their time at school and parents barely interact with their children as they work and come home exhausted; however, there are inevitable factors related to how parents affect youngsters throughout their early development process.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, children spend most of their time outside. As a result, juveniles learn most of the knowledge at school. A major regard to take into account is that since boarding schools remain prevalent, schoolboys and girls become more likely to be raised by other people rather than their parents. The cases of children who attend normal schools are not prominently different either. Mostly, the school schedule starts early in the morning and lasts until late afternoon or evening. The schedules differ from country to country, yet at any case, it includes a significant part within a day. Precisely, Asian countries impose a relatively stricter table. For example, in Japan, China, South and North Korea, youngsters spend almost the whole day at school. This explicitly indicates that children are more likely to be raised up under external factors, moreover, they embrace their main views towards several matters outside the home. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, schoolboys and girls usually have busy parents who are mostly concerned about their work. Alike their children, parents start working rather early and come home late. Although, both the parents and the juveniles spend a similar amount of time outside, parents retain much less energy as they are aged. This, in turn, leads to a lack of communication between the two sides. In fact, most youngsters are unhappy due to the fact that they barely interact with their parents. While family members spend less time together, major differences arise in personalities and views and this is defined as a general problem in the new generation. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, parents have a significant impact on children in most cases. This is because juveniles mostly embrace what their family teaches throughout their early childhood. And the way the youngsters are raised strongly depends on their family. For instance, The Turkish Olympics champion Mete Gazoz was born to become a flawless archer as his parents wanted him to be. His father and mother did lots of research to increase his accuracy in shooting and they eventually had Gazoz taking piano, guitar classes as well as dancing classes to build his impeccable career in archery. Not to forget that expatriates also encounter cultural shocks because the most crucial manners and etiquette are transferred them from their parents throughout their childhood. This leaves no doubt that it cannot be denied family has an inevitable influence.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, children begin embracing their personality and manners within the family environment, yet afterwards, they gradually become encompassed by an external entourage which eventually leads them to their ultimate development.",

        "essay": "The issue of providing higher education to young people is of utmost importance in several countries. However, cultivating literacy skills in adults who lack the ability to read and write is equally essential for society. Governments should allocate more resources to address the needs of this population. In my opinion, I support teaching every adult and ensuring they attain a high level of language proficiency. Additionally, providing high-quality education for youths is also a crucial policy for enhancing the national economy.\r\n\r\nFirstly, leading all adults to comprehensively learn and study a language enables effective communication, especially among elderly individuals. If governments invest significantly in enhancing their reading and writing abilities, it not only addresses issues of word recognition but also reduces frequent conversational conflicts. For example, some elderly adults struggle to send messages with cellphones, leading to difficulties in communicating with their offspring. If governments are willing to allocate funds to educate seniors, generation gaps could be significantly narrowed.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some parents prioritize cultivating young pupils as nations require a skilled workforce to bolster future economies. The emphasis on education reflects the understanding that a knowledgeable populace is crucial for sustained economic growth. This proactive approach by parents underscores the recognition of the pivotal role education plays in shaping a nation's prosperity in the years to come.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while prioritizing higher education for young people is vital, investing in adult education, particularly in language skills, is equally crucial for societal cohesion. I advocate for a balanced approach that addresses both segments, contributing to a harmonious society and a robust national economy.",

This essay will overview reasons as well as positive and negative sides of it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is highly important to understand the reasons for  such change. With the development of medical care and improvement of social services people's lifespan increased. Moreover, many of us prioritize career achievements. Women work long hours to climb the career ladder, thus, they do not have enough time for family and children. Getting  higher position also usually means a higher wage that is vital for the sense of financial security, which many people want to have by the time they become parents. \r\n\r\nAs any serious changes, this has an influence on society and culture. In terms of the negative aspects of becoming a parent after 35 or sometimes after 40, the main one is health. Statistically, couples after 35 more often face difficulties with having a baby than couples of a younger age. In addition, the risk of diseases and syndromes for children born in older families is considerably higher. Fortunately, the majority of health problems could be found before birth and, if possible, solved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being mature parents has its advantage.

        "essay": "Nowadays, it is perceived that the effective way to remedy issues relating to the environment is to increase the pump price of gas for vehicles generally. Although some people believe that this move would resolve the environmental crisis, however, I vehemently disagree with that statement. This essay will elaborate that petroleum products such as fuel is not the major cause of climate disasters and increasing the cost price will not yield their intended purpose.\r\n\r\nTo start with, research has shown that harvesting  trees without replacing them, mining and poor waste management  are the major causes of environmental problems. Besides, if we fail to address  \r\n\r\nthe aforementioned  causes and concentrate on fuel alone, I am afraid that the situation will be worse in the future. For instance, the government should legislate a law that prohibits the cutting of trees, wrongful disposal of waste and regulate mining companies. Despite the fact that increasing the prices of gas would to some extent aid in protecting the environment, nonetheless, it will not have tremendous a benefit as one may think. \r\n\r\nMoreover, even though an uptrend in the prices of gas to some extent will curb about 10% of environmental problems, that in itself is not sufficient, as it will cause hardship on the people as most of them will resort to other activities such as coal mining which will be detrimental to the environment. To exemplify, in 2021, the authorities in Sierra Leone  increased the cost of fuel from 10,000 Leones to 20,000 Leones per litre in order to discourage vehicle owners from using their cars. Sadly, the transport fare for public transport shot up and the prices of groceries and other goods became a big challenge for its citizens. In addition, curbing fuel in isolation will not be beneficial to the climate. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  even though some people believe that increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles in my estimation, I totally disagree with that position.",

        "essay": "With the rapidly progressing world,some traditions have become obsolete.Some still hold on to the old ways and traditions,while  others do not.Nonetheless,I completely agree that many traditions today are not worth upholding such as owning weapons,underage marriages,and preventing females from getting their education.\r\n\r\nFirstly,having some weapons at home has been a tradition in many parts of the world,which is needed to let go.Previously,in order to protect oneself ,one had to have them at home for personal safety.But now, the world is a much safer place with highly trained police and sophisticated technology  to protect its citizens.In addition to that,law and order situations may also deteriorate in the presence of weapons.To illustrate,the shooting at Christchurch mosque was a result of allowing citizens to own weapons.Thus,it is high time that we let this custom go.\r\n\r\nSecondly,underage marriage was also a thing of the past,that  needed to be laid off.Due to poor financial conditions,it would be difficult for a young couple to survive.For instance,financial instability has been reported to be one of the major causes of higher divorce rates in the USA. Also,at a younger age,a person may not be mature enough to know his  good and bad.Hence,a person should first reach the age of 18 at least,as constitutionalized by most of the states to be able to be old enough to make a wiser decision.\r\n\r\nLastly,not allowing females to get educated has been against the traditions in many parts of the world, and such customs should be abrogated.Education is a fundamental right of every human being,whether male or female.In addition to that,females make up more than  half of the world's population,so it would be unwise to have half the number illiterate.For instance,Japan has progressed economically because it has educated and utilized most of its human resources including  both genders.Therefore, the such a mindset was not even right for the old times,and ,certainly there is no point holding onto them today. \r\n\r\nTo conclude,some ways of the old were not right all along,such as disallowing the education of females and some were for older times such as keeping firearms.That is why  most of the old ways must be left behind.",

This essay will intend to analyze both the views with my pespective.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why some people believe that success depends on tertiary educations. Firstly, people who want to be settled in their career at 23 years then have only the option of graduation. There are many professions such as Law, Engineer, Doctor in which tertiary education is essential for them. If people who complete their graduation, they will not have problem to get a job. For instance, In Amazon, people which are interested in getting a job then they will have to show atleast university education. As a result, university education is extremely helpful for those who are interested in a field job.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Some masses believe that university education is not decide your success. There are mant reasons behind this notion. In the world, many peoples have their god-gifted skills such as speaking skills, sports skills, music skills or many others by which they are focusing on that particular skill so that achieve success in life. Many things are beneficial to do practical instead of theoretical. For example, In India, 70 percent of people run their own business on a large scale but interestingly, they do not have a tertiary education degree. Hence, success is depends on you and your skills not on others factors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Although people can achieve success without any degree or education but in my opinion, in the modern era, tertiary education is a more advantageous and better option for individuals.",

In this essay, I will be discussing  whether it is necessary to build  outdoor public spaces or whether there is no need to make new spaces for the general public.\r\n\r\nTo commence with the view , it is entirely important that over small towns should have playland area and walking area for the public ,due to this , people can spend their leisure time in these playgrounds and feel happy , moreover that it is very good for our children too.  So they  go to the parks  and play with other children which makes them physically fit and mentally strong . for-example , a survey was conducted  last year , which show that due to the shortage of gardens in big cities more than 60 per cent of children are unable to play  physical games .\r\n\r\nStrengthening the view , and building outdoor squares is also very important for the cities ,one of the major advantages is that  the public can sit there and feel relaxed there and can spend quality  time with their friends and family. \r\n\r\nIn the end , in my ,opinion it is a very great thing to have parks and marketplaces in the cities and the towns and the Government should take steps to build new play areas for the kids and  squares for the elder people.",

Disastrous weather such as hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, In 2004, the Tsunami in Indonesia took away millions of lives, thousands of families have lost their members and homes, and it caused a long-lasting severe economic loss not only in East Asia but also to the world.  Although the affected area has received emergency aids from domestic and international societies, the reconstruction works are still enormous and it may take decades to recover. Other examples such as melting ice sheets in the north pole which is caused by global warming,  would lead to the rise in ocean level and there is really not much that humans could do to change it. Furthermore, Coastal areas would be flooded and many species would lose theirs inhabits.  In order to tackle this problem  which is technically impossible to be solved and governments would have to spend an unimaginable amount of money \r\n\r\nThe fact has proven it is hard to survive and live with the consequence when climate change comes; therefore, every possible action must be taken to protect our environment and to prevent any disasters from happening. On the one hand, individuals would make a contribution by using reusable bags and going to work by walking or public transportation to reduce contamination to the environment.  On the other hand, governments and international organizations should promote eco-friendly resources in civilian use to help reduce emissions of fossil fuel. As a consequence, the world would develop in a more sustainable way and save more money in dealing with adapting to climate changes. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I think prevention is always better than cure. we all should take actions to help to reduce pollutions.",

Firstly, urbanisation and selling pigeon meat is one of the reasons for becoming animals and plants extinct. Secondly, hunting has become a major problem nowadays. For example, it is established that almost a hundred  species are endangered from being vanished in Uzbekistan every year as a result of hunters and poachers, who kill animals and use their skin or bones to make money and careless attitude toward plants. \r\n\r\nThereby, the disappearance of animals and spacious plants leads to a disbalance in the environment. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are can be taken several measures to prevent nature and animals from extinction.

This idea has been developed for children to acknowledge that they can not do anything just because they want to do it, and the child's penalty will not be the same as an adult's. For example, if they steal someone's values, they need to be sent to the house of correction instead of jail; for those children who need to be reviewed, let them learn about the right decision to be made. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some people believe that the father/mother should get punished instead of their kids. This idea developed from if parents taught their kids good enough, they will not commit crimes and live without the problem. If they follow this idea, the outcome when kids commit crimes will be their adults shall be sent to jail and let kids live with their cousin or relative.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both opinions have their idea and why these ideas have been developed. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the latter statement. For example, youngsters need to learn the consequences if they do not follow society's laws.",

        "essay": "In recent times, there has been a lot of industrial development. As mostly this development is confined to large or metropolitan cities, many individuals from other cities have to shift to earn their bread and butter. This essay will illustrate both pros and cons of this trend in detail.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, moving to other cities away from their family and friends have various benefits. First of all, it lends a helping hand in making individuals independent. While living away from family, one has to take care of all the basic needs like cooking, buying groceries, maintaining accommodation themselves which make them self sufficient. Moreover, in this way, people also learn how to manage their earnings. Also, staying away makes them appreciate their loved ones more. In addition to this, it also boosts one's confidence, improves their communication skills and enhances their problem-solving abilities. For instance, many IT professional move to other cities for their jobs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this trend has a number of drawbacks as well. Firstly, living away from families can induce loneliness and mental health issue in individuals as they get less emotional support. Likewise, some people can also overlook their dietary patterns and eat outside in the absence of homemade food which can lead to various health problems. Furthermore, in case of any emergency, it becomes difficult for them to get help. Also, this affects the bond between family members as individuals are overloaded with responsibilities and tasks while living far. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is apt to conclude that while staying away from family make one more responsible and independent, however, it can also attribute to various physical and mental health issues. To improve this situation, the government should take some steps to scatter industries throughout different cities and towns so that people can also enjoy the bliss of family life while doing their jobs.",

Someone may say that this process will continue, resulting in the loose of all the jobs. While others say that there are professions that only living humans can do. I agree with the latter opinion and process this view in this essay. \r\n\r\n Most importantly, professions dealing with feelings are difficult to be managed by AI. It is a privilege for human beings to be moved, shocked or angry and needless to say, those emotions can not be understood by artificially made things. For example, jobs such as mental counsellors can not be replaced. This is because there are no patterns or concrete solutions that can be applied to a mental problem. Problems regarding sentiments are always different and so the solutions are uncountable like stars. It is impossible for AI to deal with it using a pattern programmed previously. \r\n\r\n On the other hand, someone may say that if we give all the accumulated information about a job, AI will be able to run the work. I agree to some extent but the more jobs AI steals, the more works people will nurture. AI is special in that it can use effectively all the past information. However, it is unable to make new things because it lacks creativity. Therefore, only humans are able to make innovations and innovative jobs can not be replaced by humans. \r\n\r\n In conclusion, AI will never replace all jobs because it can not understand feelings and give birth to innovations.",

        "essay": "Companies compete for consumer attention through an increasing number of advertisements. Though advertisements impact people to a certain extent, there are ways to safeguard them. \r\n\r\nThese days advertisements are so manipulative that they control the behaviour of people towards products these days. People are drawn to buy commodities they will not ever need or sometimes are harmful to them. For instance, soft drinks like Coca Cola and Pepsi are advertised in a way that they attract consumers who know that these drinks damage their teeth and upset their stomachs. Technology has also opened doors for these businesses to manipulate people. Almost every website and mobile application track their users, from their eating habits to their clothing size, they harvest as much data as possible. This data is further sold to the advertisers who create targeted ads for these customers and hypnotise them into buying their products. Sometimes, the data that is supposed to be private, like phone numbers or emails of the users, is hacked due to the absence of security measures in these applications. This type of hacking is promoted because advertising agencies are willing to pay millions so they can spam those phone numbers or emails.\r\n\r\nKeeping these advertisements in check is paramount. Firstly, it should be mandatory for these advertisements to tell people about the adverse effects of their product on people's health and the environment. Secondly, an organisation or a task force should be created with the purpose of finding the defaulters of the above rule, so all agencies should follow this seriously. Thirdly, websites or applications that sell their users' data without their clear consent should be penalised and if such data is sold to advertisers and they use that data, those advertisers should be punished too. This would create fright among these companies and they would not involve themselves with such sellers without proper due diligence. Finally, there must be a strict regimen dictating the protection of customer data by websites, mobile applications and advertising companies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, advertisements affect the mindset of the people into buying useless and harmful products but through rules and regulations on these advertisements, it is possible to safeguard people.",

While some people hold a strong claim that nothing we can do in this day and age because it is too late, the opposite makes a statement that with a view to revamping the situation, some efficient activities should be implemented.\r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, there is an eclectic mix of convincing reasons which contributes to a notion that it is too late to treat those pressing consequences rooted by humans on plants and animals. They account for those irresponsible and selfish actions ranging from urban sprawl to overgrazing, especially deforestation. For the time being, there is an ever-growing demand for lands to live as well as woods to consume, which breeds abundant species on the verge of extinction and some may have died out already. Pandas in China which are on the brink of extinction nowadays can be cited as a suitable instance. Pupils had set fire to the forests, chopped down a majority of trees on their own purpose, by doing so, those poor pandas consequently lost their home to where they used to settle. Hence, due to a great many persuading roots, it is fairly late for humans to fix what they have done to flora and fauna.\r\n\r\nWhilst the negative effects which are bred by humans are widely acknowledged, some effective approaches in order to redress that urgent matter still lingers. There are plentiful reserves that have been put up in order to provide a safe environment for those endangered faunas.

As few people believe that teenagers are necessary to work for free in community related work during their liesure period. This essay illustrates some of the benifits of working for teenagers.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, teenagers will help the society in some way by doing other people's job. As they will get to know about the insights of how the people are stuggling to get paid. To exemplify, if teenagers agrees to work for the society, it will be helpful for the people, as it reduces some amount of burden which are carried out. In short, we could say that children will learn to be considerate to others. In other way, its going to benift the children as they will get good exposure to outside world. For example, if children are found to be spending time on their own, it will affect them in future, as they would not have any background knowledge of how the work life is balanced in the society. Moreover, working for the society will teach them a good cultural knowledge, develops interpersonal skills and value of their work.\r\n\r\nHowever,it is known that one should earn his/her own bread, its every parents responsibity to guide their children in a proper manner, by teaching them the values of life and importance of working.

But these days, they are often laden with increased duties. From my perspective, inculcating children with responsibilities help them in becoming good citizens. The essay will discuss both the positive and negative impacts of the practice.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, forcing adolescents to carry extra duties on their shoulders has its own negative effects. Firstly, this might create an extra burden on them. As a result, it can lead to stress and other related problems at a young age. This is illustrated by the commonly seen anger and irritation in kids nowadays, severely affecting their developing brains. Finally, adolescents would not be able to enjoy their childhood happily and freely.  \r\n\r\nOn the other side, there are a noteworthy number of productive effects associated with this practice. First of all, making young ones carry extra liabilities on their back make them better and responsible human beings in future. This further helps them to become more socially and morally responsible. In addition, it will help in shaping their character as well as moral behaviour and ethics. For instance, the parents who teach their kids to be more responsible towards helping needy people, saving money, studies, country, etc., are able to watch their kids rise and become respected citizens in the offing. \r\n\r\nTo summarise, having children to bear more responsibilities from young age, bring ethical values in them and makes their future brighter and therefore, they become respected and responsible citizens of the country.

        "essay": "Nowadays, many young adults are seen to be a sluggish generation compared to the older ones. They often display the actions of being spoiled and lazy who can only spend money to have fun. Many believe that these kids should be assigned to do voluntary social work during their extra time instead of just chilling at home. In this essay, I will discuss and state my opinion regarding this issue. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, those adults who propose this idea claim that giving opportunities to young adolescents to do voluntary jobs will benefit not only the kids themselves but also society. Parents think that training their heirs from a young age will help them to overcome social issues in the future. For instance, adults who are used to being involved in local society as volunteers are more sociable. Therefore, they find it easier to get hired for a job,and also are able to contribute to building the neighbourhood. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some disadvantages to this belief. One of the primary negative sides that might appear is youngsters consider it as a common thing. In  other words, If a teenage person is forced to carry out an unpayable task, they might end up thinking that it is a common thing to do a job without getting properly appreciated with rewards. For example, if they are employed in a company that requires them to do extra hours without any compensation, they can only accept it as it is because it is seen as a normal thing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are convincing arguments on both ideas, I personally believe that training the young generation to get used to work by joining the local community without getting paid and get proper experience to prepare themselves for their upcoming adult lives.",

Proponents of this view may suggest that young people should go to  work after finishing their studies at school because former pupils can start earning money and learning how it is to be an adult. For example, my friend's parents suggested her to get a job after her study, and she started earning money for her living in the cafe. However, It was the only place where she could work after school, but at least, she managed to make some money for herself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am in agreement with those who say that in order to have a great profession, students have to get further knowledge. An important reason is that you can only get a well-paid position if you have  evidence of your knowledge. For instance, you can not work at a law company or at a hospital without finishing particular courses.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, whereas many are convinced that the best variant would be to go working after getting basic education, I side with those who suggest that if people want to receive a great job, they have to enter  university.",

Some soft skills like working with other people, taking responsibility and collaboration are only possible learning by doing. Regarding this, young generations are encouraged to attend voluntarily jobs to gain these skills. For example, there are many programmes driven by non-governmental organisations to help people in need such as being a part of a team in a refugee camp or distributing foods to homeless people can contribute to youngsters mental development significantly. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, societies in a huge need workforce in voluntery activities.

        "essay": "Nowadays automobile congestions on the road have become a common problem in the urban areas all across the globe. Moreover, this issue is somewhat affecting the quality of living of the working individuals. This essay will discuss a few main reasons responsible for this issue and suggest some solutions to it, followed by a conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne of the root cause of soaring road-movement congestions can be that more than 80% of the companies are based in towns and thus attracting job seekers from various rural areas to shift to these cities. Which as a result is overcrowding the urban population and leading to other related issues such as automobile-congestion. To exemplify, since Mumbai is the business capital of the nation and it has a large number of organizations placed here, more than 70% of the individuals living in the city are migrants from various underdeveloped places. Every day, these humans spend not less than 2 hours to commute to their office. In solution to these issues, it has been suggested by many working-class that the work opportunities should be distributed among the rural and urban areas. This will lead to less bottle-neck in the cities. Hence, eliminating related issues such as high transportation volumes. At the same time, it will also promote the job market in developing towns. \r\n\r\nAnother reason could be the similarity in the office timing of the majority of firms. Consequently, the standard job hours of all the corporates are the same. To illustrate, more than 90% of the companies have office hours as 9am to 5pm. Therefore, mostly everyone starts their travel to reach the job or to their home at the same time and end up spending hours in traffic.To negate this everyday stress, the government bodies can suggest the corporates to re-built the working hours industry-wise. For instance, maybe the Telecome industry can be guided to amend their work timing as 8:00 am to 4:00pm and automobile industry can keep 11:00 am to 6:00 pm as their job schedule. Subsequently, bifurcating the traffic load from the roads.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the everyday stress of heavy road traffic can be eliminated by distributing the work opportunity among the rural and urban cities as well as by industry-wise bifurcating the office-timings.",

While some argue that it must be done due to the benefits it makes outweighed the disadvantages. I believe that both ways have their reasons to be expended equally.\r\n\r\n On one hand, the better roadways are, the safer they will become. It is a common thing, especially in many large municipalities that the wear and tear of streets over time entail the authority's expenditure higher and higher to bring down traffic congestion. By easing commodity circulation, The expansion of thoroughfare systems can promote economic improvement. Furthermore, there are some cases highways play a crucial role in terms of personal mobility when it is not possible on public routes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, greater public transportations are supremely beneficial for not only the administration financially but also for the environment. Additionally, the enormous number of citizens using buses or subways proved that this transportation system is irreplaceable. For instance, a bus can replace several motorcycles on a particular route and consume less fuel due to its large capacity for passengers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while many residents argue that the national account should be allocated for constructing expressways rather than advancing mass commutes, I once again reaffirmed my point of view that the two categories of systems are immensely essential and well-spending on them can profit us in many ways.",

Accordingly, they do not need breaks, sick leaves, or holidays. For this reason, robots constantly work, and therefore companies make more profit. In many countries around the world cashiers in supermarkets have been already replaced by automatic stations, which work around the clock. For these reasons, jobs, which can be replaced by artificially intelligent will be replaced. \r\n\r\nWhile some human labour can be carried out by robots there are still jobs which require humans. On the one hand,  automatic machines must get developed and programmed by human employees. Especially in the medical field, skilled workers are indispensable. For example, nurses who look after the patients as well as therapists help them to recover. Especially, people in need, need people whom they can trust and rely on. Such a relationship will not be able to have with an artificially intelligent robot and therefore, robots will never be able to achieve those social skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is most likely that many jobs will be conducted by artificially intelligent robots at some point. Unskilled work will be replaced by robots ,however there are still jobs which only can be performed by human specialists. Overall, the future holds many new unknown, scary and exciting options for us, which will probably make our lives easier.",

        "essay": "Every country faces global environmental problems and they are very concerned about how to decrease those problems. Although, it is sometimes thought the best way to solve it to increase the cost of fuel. In my opinion, I considered that environmental issues can be solved in different manners.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons to decline the matter of global environmental. The first and foremost important thing is that to ban the single-use of plastic. Plastic is a non-biodegradable item and it is very harmful to the environment. For instance, in one survey has conducted in the UK, 50% of environmental causes are happened by plastic. In addition, if government take a strict action against use of plastic such as plastic bottles, straws, carry bags and so on so,it is possible to reduce that problem.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider to solve the environmental problem is to encourage people for more plantations. In big cities, more people are doing deforestations to build tall buildings and industries and it is also affects weather changes. For example, without trees it is very hard to keep the air clean and neat and people are getting a lack of rain. Hence, palnts and trees are the best way to stop that problems.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fuel is responsible for getting more issues in environment. nowadays persons prefer their own vehicles for transportations and this trend is booming. In addition, raising the cost of fule could be help to fall down the global warming.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, numerous ways are available to solve the global environmental issues and government should encourage people to use  renewable things and try to solve them.",

        "essay": "Some believe in educating young people while others argue that policy makers should invest more in teaching adults who are unable to read and write. Even though it is necessary for adult population to be literate, I do not believe that spending more to educate them is a good move.\r\n\r\nPutting more resources to educate middle-aged adults might be a wasted effort. Adults, who are illiterate, have their own commitments. They might not have the time and energy to learn the basic education. For example, they get up early and work throughout the day. Generally, they are blue-collar workers, and their work demands high physical labour. By the time their work ends, they simply would want to go home, have a warm family dinner and head to bed to re-charge for the next day. If they are unwilling to commit, investment in teaching them could go to waste.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it will be difficult to persuade them to learn how to read and write at their age. They might find going to the night classes embarrassing. I have a neighbour who is in her fifties but did not receive education during her younger years. I read her the headings in the daily newspapers every evening after work. I have ever asked her if she would like to learn how to read for half an hour every day, but she does not wish to, since she is shameful to start reciting alphabets at her age.\r\n\r\nAll in all, since it will be difficult to get most of the adult population to start learning and commit throughout the journey, I believe that governments should not invest more than the current limit to educate them.",

I ,unquestionably , disagree with it for the following reasons .\r\n\r\nTo initiate , the Prime goal of education is to make an individual a self-dependent , self-reliant person. An independent and free-willed person can take part in every small to bigger event at an early age only ,thus producing an adult with immense confidence . Such a person can do any task with utmost perfection as the fear factor is almost negligible in him . Moreover , a confident individual can stand out differently amidst the crowd and is often chosen for a pivotal role .For example , all the world-class leaders who are sitting in the highest positions and are running a nation smoothly are the products of a school ,which once believed in them .\r\n\r\nMoving on , plainly having individuals with ethics and morals would not take a nation onto the path of success. A country's strength is measured in terms of numbers of doctors,engineers ,teachers , technologists and many more . All these kinds of professionals are produced only if they are presented with the opportunities to develop skills for concerned occupations . The larger the educated working  population ,the richer the state is .  Hence , a child should be advised to take the subject of his or her own interest in order to gain the skill. \r\n\r\nTo conclude , a region's actual wealth is its population which needs to be highly skilled in order to reach  the pinnacle and it could only be generated by focusing on formal education of personal interest.",

        "essay": "In this cut throat competition, every person wants to become a rich and wealthy. So some would like to do job in their teenage life, whereas some people wants to get proper knowledge in some particular field. I would like to mention here that both the opinion is good as so many people are well known without getting a bachelors degreedegree. But in my opinion education is key for success.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Nowadays, as I mention education is required for success and for a better future. Because if you have any degree then you can simply apply for the position and then you have an option of showing your talent or any extra skill which might lead you to the upper position but if you do not have degree then this not an easy task.  Secondly, there is immense benefit of doing university and college like, at the age of 20 person have enough maturity to decide which is the right path and suitable to his/her skill. In addition, person becomes a focus-oriented as he/she already spent 3-4 years in one field so, they started admiring so many people from their field and they got confidence to do the hard workwork. \r\n\r\nThirdly, as per recent trend so many colleges and university students get direct placement in there final year, so without even wasting a single day they have job offer and they can start earning. Also, some courses have compulsory internship and sometimes they got an opportunity to work in a multinational company so they got enough experience as well in their field although they got very less money in the form of stipend still it worth after one year of completion when they get job offer with good package.\r\n\r\nHowever, the phenomenon of doing job directly after school is faltering but there are so many successful people in the world whose earning is way more than educated person. For example Sachin Tendulkar, who know as a God cricket, he doesn't have any degree after ten, but his firm determination and hard work made him number one in his field. AS well as so many people wants to join their parents' business and don't want to waste their three or four in education. One signal paper cannot decide your future, just like that if you give 100% in any field and do constant hard work you can get success.\r\n\r\nNutshell, I would like to say that there are enormous benefits if you get a proper degree and tad benefit if you do not have proper degree but still no one can stop you from becoming a successful if you give your heart and soul in a particular fieldfield.",

        "essay": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. In the following paragraph, I will explain the reason and how to research this.\r\n\r\n   The primary reason why some people nowadays have the tendency to look for a house or building history is that they want to understand the structure. Some people are simply fascinated by the original architecture or the design of the place they are living in. Old buildings that still stand will usually have some interesting history about them. The fact that they survived so long is itself a sign that those buildings were important at the time of their construction. Maybe they were occupied by royal or aristocratic families. Finding out such details can be interesting for many people. For some people, researching the history of the building could be an attempt to avoid staying in a haunted place or something like that. If the building has a haunted past, people can choose not to live in them.\r\n\r\n  There are various ways people can find this information. The simplest method is that people can ask local citizens for information, especially the elders. Because they are the people who lived in that neighbourhood for a long time,  they will be a worthwhile source of information if anyone wants to understand more about their houses or their living areas. Another way is to search for information on the Internet or through other modes such as books or historic articles. For instance, Paris's old town has many buildings changed into museums and learning spaces.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people are looking up the history of their home because they may be fascinated by its architecture or they may have heard many stories about it. Locals are definitely the best source of information about such buildings. Historical documents may also help.",

It is omnipresent for all, TV adverts, Social Media Marketing, billboards, Personal advertisements and many more diverse ways. while this phenomenon is escalating to extremely new level, people are in influence of it. In my view, it has more positive effects than harmful.\r\n\r\nBecause of advertisements, people are aware of current products in market. At some extent, it educates the people and provides the knowledge. For an instance, In India serious disease like  polio is no more and the major success goes to awareness campaign help by famous personality with the use of digital marketing and TV advertisements. Moreover, to bind user with interest usually companies display various new idea and it add major value in entertainment world.\r\n\r\nHowever, the critical impacts are also not avoidable.Firstly, it exposes kids and young generation towards the violence and  inappropriate content sometime. Secondly, Advertisements with various discounts and offers, make people lure to do impulsive shopping. Increasing obesity is also one of consequence of advertisement of junk food. In addition, few times people get influenced by various advertisings and tend to work more to achieve never ending desire of buying stuff, this approach add up to the stress and frustration. What more, kids might suffer from harmful psychological effects when their parents are unable to afford various products shown in advertisements.\r\n\r\nTo put this in a nutshell, I can say that advertisement is beneficial phenomenon with a number of insignificant drawbacks. In my view, negative advertising effects can be lowered with help of government using stringent approach and awareness campaigns.",

On the flip side, the amount of time spent on television affects the behaviour most, others said. From my aspect, I agree with the first statement by analyzing many factors.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, online media becomes a part of one's life undeniably and most parents tend to treat their children by allowing them to watch whatever they desire, on top of that, many media have different merits either informative or entertaining channels, furthermore, the tendency of being influenced by these seems to increase. For instance, despite watching Youtube all day long, the one entering the page containing full of knowledge can reap lots of benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the amount of time is not related since in the case of the previous example, it appears to be more effective, hence, it is able to be concluded that the media visited more influences young folks than random TV shows represented. To illustrate, as known, most shows on TV are randomized with a dearth of any cautions for the audiences, the certification turning up viewers' age extent is usually written solely.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it seems to me that the medium viewed from entering by the audience is more effective to control one's behaviour and interaction, Not only the parents but also the kids can receive a good deal of benefits maintaining entertainment and knowledge, thus, the first thought outweighs the second from my prospect.",

This answer will explore why this trend is becoming popular among people these days and how can these people find the answer for their curiosity. \r\n\r\nTo embark on, nowadays social media has influenced people’s daily lives in many aspects. Accordingly, there are many social media influencers posting about how they discovered a secret room, secret box, or secret door in their very own houses. These kinds of content have an effect on people’s curiosity: whether there were something in their house. For instance, my distant brother who has always been a fan of secret stories, he inspired by these kinds of content and tries to conduct research about his home and his apartment, yet he finds nothing. In other words, driven by curiosity imposed by influencers, more and more people tend to be interested in the background of their house. \r\n\r\nMoreover, to conduct findings of something is not difficult in modern days, anyone can search for anything online. Many search engine platform such as Google or Yahoo has broadened the people’s scope of exploration. Searching of the building backstories is not an exception, people who are curious about the history of their house could find it online as well. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the fact that more and more people are interested in the history of their own homes is because they are influenced by social media content.

        "essay": "Nowadays social media has become an important way for people to communicate with friends and family and keep up with news events. I agree with the idea that the merits of using social media every day outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that using social media too often may lead to addiction. People may indulge in online communication and ignore their friends and family around them. Some children, for example, may be reluctant to participate in outdoor activities where they can socialize with their peers. Also, some adults may dare not communicate with their colleagues face to face. They may be unwilling to attend offline social events where they can enhance their understanding with colleagues and get familiar with each other. As a result, their cooperation with other staff will run into problems, which may affect their work efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, social media can help people to get in touch with more people and news events. Social media provides people with an opportunity to be familiar with people from different backgrounds and regions. Thus, it helps people expand their social circle and broaden their horizons. For instance, many people will get in touch with people from all walks of life through TikTok, some of whom may become their friends. Besides, people can get to know the latest news events at once and feel connected to the world. Yang Qian, for example, who won the first gold medal for China, immediately become a household name after the Olympics in her country due to the widespread use of social media.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, although some may argue that using social media every day will cause people not to adapt to face-to-face communication, I still think that people can have easy access to contact with other people and keep up with news events through social media.",

        "essay": "Education is extremely important for the physical and mental development of students. It's argued that the greatest purpose of schools is to help children to function as  good members of society, while others believe that the focus should be on individual characteristics in order to discover unique features of a child. I agree with the latter statement, and this essay will explain why.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, providing education in order to graduate students who will become useful for their country has merit. If young people are aware of the rules and laws in their nation, this leads to  appropriate behaviours towards colleagues and other citizens in general. However, I do not think that this should be a priority of schools, because it will not bring an understanding to children about who they are and what they want to do in their life. For example, many Russian citizens discover their natural preferences and interests only when they turn thirty, just because in the past, many schools focused on civic education in order to develop patriotism, encouraging everyone to be the same as others.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is essential to listen to the child's voice, supporting their natural needs, because this eventually will help discover their secret talents and unique abilities. By participating in play and learning experiences that students truly love, instead of pushing them to concentrate on skills and subjects which are generally approved by the government, learners discover the individual features that help them to decide what occupation they want to have in the future. For instance, one of the most famous musicians Elvis Presley was judged by educators  for  poor performance at school and being not able to achieve overall scores for passing exams. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if the educational system is focused on creating productive employees and citizens only, people will lack their unique abilities causing disinterest in their work and even depression. Hence, it is vital to concentrate on child's needs and wants, in order to help them to become a confident individual who is free to make a choice about their future career.",

        "essay": "Some argue that advertising has positive effects on the economy because it is an effective method to ramp up sales. Conversely, others believe that it invites negative effects by making people dissatisfied and buying more stuff. Although it possesses negative aspects because it causes impulsive buying, this essay thinks that advertisement brings more positive effects to the companies.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people believe that advertisements will cause individuals to feel insufficient and want to buy more of the items. This is because the promotion highlights distinctive features that are superior to the existing stuff in the market. Thus the public will be enticed to try and buy the items. Especially when this marketing program uses influencers to promote their products. For example, a skincare brand pays beauty influencers to review positively their newly launched product. People who see this promotional post will think that the product works well even though these public figures already have healthy and perfect skin conditions before using the products. Therefore, women impulsively buy them because they want to have a better appearance. However, as grown-ups, they can restrain their desire for non-primary needs. In addition, brands without advertising their products, will face difficulty in introducing their innovations to the public.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the effective way to introduce innovations to the market is by advertising. This is because brands can emphasize the features of their innovations which have competitive advantages compared to similar items in the market. A marketing campaign is a way to invite people to try and buy their products. Better sales bring more revenue to the company. The profitable company contributes to the positive economic climate. For instance, Shopee conducted many promotional campaigns to enhance its gross merchandise value. This good performance improves the employees’ welfare. This essay believes that advertisements bring positive effects to economic growth through higher sales and better performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although promotion activities invoke individuals to buy complementary stuff that can enhance their lives, they should be seen as a way to generate more revenue for the companies and affect positively the economy in a greater landscape.",

Personally speaking, I agree with the statement because in a community people have to work together if they want to live in a high living standard. \r\n\r\nWorking for their own community, teenagers could broaden their social skills and become aware of their role in a society. During that time, those people could get along with some senior locals and exchange experiences, for example. It is also the perfect way to start developing working skills when  delivering the mail, walking pets for their neighbors/the elders, cleaning pools, to start with. These are some services that an unexperienced teenager could get involved. In community service, teenagers do not have to have previous experience and it is not a demanding job which teenagers could easily learn from and understand the value of working. \r\n\r\nIf, from one side, one can number lots of benefits, on the other hand/side, some people can have bias against those kinds of jobs because they give the false impression that those who are serving the community are required to do so because they might have done something wrong or harmful to others, since these kinds of services are currently being used as punishment. Working for a community should not be a punishment in any circumstances. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can see that motivating a teenager to do voluntary work is a posivite win-win attitude and, as result of this kind of job, community leaders could invest their effords in other important needs such as providing better heath and education structure in a feedback wheel.",

        "essay": "These days most people want to get their work done almost instantly. They don’t have the time or patience to wait. Right now, right here is the motto. I attribute this change in attitude to the development in technology, especially internet and mobile technology and, in my opinion, it can be positive and negative at the same time.\r\n\r\nNo other technology has had a greater impact on our lives than the internet technology. To say that the internet revolutionized our lives is an understatement. It has made it possible for us to perform just about anything with a few clicks of a button. It allows us to book tickets online, buy things and pay bills anytime and from anywhere. Gone are the days when we had to stand in a long queue to buy railway tickets or pay utility bills. All of those mundane tasks can now be performed within a few seconds. The biggest advantage of the internet is that we can carry it around because it works on a variety of devices of all sizes and shapes. Obviously, it is quite normal for a generation that grew up using the internet from their childhood to want to get everything done in seconds.\r\n\r\nHowever, this insistence on getting instant support or response can be positive or negative depending upon our access to technology. The internet has certainly made our lives comfortable and faster. It has allowed us to save a lot time. However, like any other technology, the internet technology can also fail us from time to time. Connection speeds vary from place to place. Also, the reliability is not the same throughout the day. It is not uncommon for people addicted to instant gratification to panic when they lose connectivity. This is a common problem when city people visit rural areas where the internet is either slow or inaccessible.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, if the present generation wants to get everything done instantly, that is because they grew up using the internet technology. While this trend is largely positive, in my opinion, over dependence on anything is bad.",

        "essay": "It is assumed that the majority of jobs in the future will be done by machines with artificial intelligence. Although, some unskilled occupations might be replaced by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that do not need the human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why only particular jobs will be carried out by people.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, all menial jobs eventually would taken over by robots in the near future. In the other words, due to technology improvement works that does not require any specific and complex human skills can be replaced easily. For the simple reason that, it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. For instance, in canada some food deliveries have been replaced by automated robots that cost far less than employees. In addition, these food deliveries work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pays. For these reasosn, robotic intelligence will carry out unskilled or easy jobs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, conversly, there are some occupations that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the ability to do them. Put simply, some jobs cannot be done without a human touch or skill. For example, these jobs include Psychology and Medicine or more. Bots cannot think or feel so they will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution thousands of years to achieve.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is increasingly likely that automatons will end most human employment.

It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.\r\nIn my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.\r\nFor instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,\r\nit seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.\r\nAnother example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.\r\nHowever, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.\r\nIn order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.\r\nThus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.",

        "essay": "These days, some people believe that teenagers should do unpaid work in their spare time for the benefit of society. I strongly agree with this notion that it is necessary to engage them in voluntary work. This essay will discuss the main point of view with an example. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, adolescents who take a part in voluntary work would be more responsive to the community When they get involved with other residents  they come to realize the problem that society deals with every day like poverty, pollution and  more. Moreover, we all had been affected during the Covid-19 pandemic and people suffer a loss. As revealed by “The voice of Vietnam” a volunteer who is against the virus and empathizes with the mental pain that the patients are going through, he always delivers oxygen and food to people who need it the most. For that ,reason voluntary makes students the most responsible citizens of the country. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, unpaid work can help children to expand their social cycle and soft skills. Because they are participating in unpaid jobs they will meet different types of people, as they learn from leadership, teamwork, communication, and handling difficulties,For Instance,  recent research conducted in Japan has revealed that students who take part in voluntary work can be more sociable, energetic and more respectful to others. Compared to those who do not do unpaid work, they become more introverted, idle and listless. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, voluntary work for teenagers is a first step to moving toward social life and learning crucial skill sets and becoming more responsible for society.",

        "essay": "In the modern world, masses purchase only those things which are of great quality and meet their requirements. Therefore, individuals believe that adverts are no longer needed, and these are just a source of entertainment. I completely disagree with the notion because advertisements help people to know about new products, and it influences them.\r\nTo commence with, if companies advertise their products, the customers can come to know about their newly launched items as they not only gain information about its features, but also tell them how to use it. So, this is the prominent reason why advertisements are needed. For example, Apple, known for its quality products in the mobile phone industry, has captured fifty percent market share in India after advertising its products in the Indian subcontinent because this brand provides accurate information in its promotional. Hence, advertisement plays a pivotal role to increase customer awareness and selling new products for organizations.\r\nMoreover, commercials also support the institutions to influence the consumers to purchase goods because there is a huge competition in the market among the competitors, and a number of high-quality products are available for sale. Thus to boost the sales, adverts are essential. For instance, in India, there are two big brands, namely Bajaj and Hero Honda, which manufacture motorbikes as end products of these brands are equally efficient, and they promote them to convince the people to buy their products. Thereby, it is apparent that advertising is vital in selling things.\r\nTo summarize, advertisements are significant, even if the product quality is superior. In my opinion, it tells masses about new launches as well as helps them to choose the right brand.",

        "essay": "While some demographics of society opine that museums should act as entertainment hubs, critics argue that these sites should foster educational values among visitors. Although both the conflicting perceptions have their own justification, I strongly agree with the latter viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to comprehend why some individuals are in harmony with the former assertion. This is simply because they believe if there is too much emphasis on acquainting visitors with historic and scientific facts, people will feel boredom and it will probably restrict their revisiting tendency; consequently, the statistics pertaining to visits to these exhibitions centres will drop exponentially. In order to avoid this downfall, art galleries should serve the purpose of entertainment by acting as entertainment outlets which will definitely allure the target audience, especially the youngsters. To illustrate, unique and fascinating games at museums not only help to rejuvenate exhausted minds but also encourage individuals to visit again and again. In short, being able to amuse masses means museums will be able to survive and thrive.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I along with others firmly criticise this idea and acknowledge that these sites can work wonders in promoting cultural awareness when these are focused at educating individuals. When masses see astonishing collection of artefacts used previously by their ancestors, they would be able to make fine judgements about cultural values which are regarded as soul of every culture; resultanly, they will get deep understanding of their culture. For example, one can get amazing experience of Punjabi culture by visiting Khalsa heritage, museum located at Anandpur Sahib, as curators available over there provide guidance about the exhibited tools and objects. Thus, these exhibition centres could prove extremely advantageous in familiarising people with their cultural roots if these are aimed at educating masses.\r\n\r\nConclusively, despite the fact that museums could provide recreational and entertaining activities, I would argue the main aim of these sites must be to educate people.",

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "Two centuries ago, when people celebrated the evolutionary development brought by industrialization, no one would ever anticipate that a profound change of global climate would be caused by the “machines” humans had made. However, many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem, which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures. This essay will explain the major causes of global climate change, followed by several plausible solutions.\r\nIt has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change, and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. First, our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity, acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal. A colossal amount of smoke, predominantly carbon dioxide, is released during this process. As a result, the smoke captures excessive heat on the Earth, resulting in an increase in global temperatures. Second, consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way. As the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs, more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum. The process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Thus, burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change.\r\nHowever, although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, several actions could decelerate the effect. One major step is to urge the energy-dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries. Like large cloth manufacturers, giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day. By reducing productivity, the amount of energy they need can drop. At the same time, the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate. On the other hand, individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints. Every small step, such as turning off the lights when leaving home, taking public transportations instead of driving cars, or simply eating less meat, can make big changes.\r\nIn conclusion, the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures. Nevertheless, this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals.",

I believe this is going to be true that many jobs would be done by robots for the sake of efficiency, however, there are still some tasks which require human involvement.\r\nAddressing the stance, the coming era is a time of efficiency at a faster pace so to achieve the same, these computers have to be incorporated into the workforce. To fulfil the current demand, computers are the best substitute for human beings. Moreover, they do not even demand leave from work and eventually work for twenty-four seven. Take Vardhman Mills Private Limited for instance, who plans to introduce unmanned warehouse in their plant to improve the efficiency. Resultantly, there is no question to ask that machines would be used as workers for companies all around the world, but still, there are some jobs which can only be managed by real humans.\r\nTalking about the other side, there are some jobs which require human skills like critical thinking which cannot be provided by artificially intelligent robots. Specifically, marketing jobs require critical thinking which can change the fate of companies. This is why such jobs cannot be regarded as an appropriate job for artificially intelligent robots. Ultimately, it is crystal clear that the artificially intelligent robot workers are going to be a real reality of the near future, whereas some jobs such as marketing would be taken by humans only.\r\nCompiling my thoughts, the truth of the future is that robots will be working in companies, but I strongly feel that some job profiles like marketing managers is not a task for robots but for humans due to their critical thinking ability.",

In fact, water surface has already increased, and it has affected the ecosystem. For instance, a survey conducted by the Korea Scientific Foundation has revealed that ice age will come back if humans cannot stop changing weather. Therefore, it is evident that if human beings are fail to prevent climate change, they will be extincted in the world.\r\n\r\n Secondly, as there are certain ways to protect the earth from climate change, individuals have to do their best, and living with fluctuating climate is the last choice when the world population have no way to prevent it. Not only can the comsuption of fossi fuels are reduced by the public with using public transportaion, it may also decreased by government to allocate state funds to develop eco-friendly energy.

It is often seen that in every household people are having two or three cars, which not only lead to heavy traffic on roads but also put pressure on our surroundings as these motor vehicles emit poisonous gases.

Therefore, it has been decided by certain section of people to elevate the price of auto mobiles and petrol, to regulate the environmental conditions. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the government could implement the theory of demand and supply inversely, by curbing the supply of vehicles and fuel, as the level of pollution has increased globally, which is responsible for global warming.

For this reason I do not think that modern music can be dangerous for young people because I can not find negative effects related to that.\r\n\r\nAlthough I believe that there will not be problem among younger, others argued that modern music can have a negative impact on modern society in light of the fact that it can influence listeners to copy the action of singer which sometimes are lead to negative effects, forr example smoking weed or having a gangster behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as I said, I believe that there will not a problem for young who listen modern music due to the fact that all the society have experienced a particular kind of music which often are dangerous whit violent texts and bad words.",

        "essay": "These days famous personalities, such as film stars and reality show stars, are gaining popularity because of their colossal wealth as well as glamorous appearance rather than their outstanding achievements, and this trend negatively impacts youngsters. I agree with this viewpoint as after seeing these celebrities' lifestyles, sometimes many children not only go through cosmetic surgeries but also adopt wrong methods to become affluent. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo begin with, these days, many young boys and girls are undergoing beautification surgeries in a lure to look more attractive after following their beloved stars. Since many famous personalities give their highest priority to looks, they undergo several types of plastic surgeries to become more charming. While following these surgical procedures similar to these personalities, sometimes young fans distort their appearance, which has a life-long impact. For example, a recent survey found that many millennials are pushing towards facial fillers due to their desire to look like their famous film stars, which may result in their facial deformities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMoreover, many teens tend to become overnight affluent to experience the pleasures of their favourite personalities' lifestyles. Sometimes they get trapped in wrongful practices, such as thefts and shoplifting. Consequently, these malpractices not only spoiled their lives but also shattered the trust of their mothers and fathers as these parents would have several hopes for their children’s future. For example, a recent study showed that after watching the reality shows of lavish celebrities, the incidents of juvenile delinquency surged by twenty-five per cent in New York City.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo conclude, nowadays, many adolescents are blindly imitating public figures who are well-known for their enormous wealth as well as charming appearances. However, this would have several negative consequences on young generations because while copying these stars, they sometimes distort their physical appearance and start doing wrongful acts to make fast bucks.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, people argue that the one way to ameliorate our traffic conditions' safety is to impose higher money than current fees for aggressive drivers. Although some drivers do not agree with this trend, the government should implement strong social restraints. \r\n\r\n When it comes to traffic conditions in South Korea, a lot of vehicles and drivers are driving, however,  some of them frequently break the rule while they drive. To put it simply, restrictions do not affect to reduce offensive driving. This is because offensive drivers might know if they speed on the highway or common roads, they end up paying only a small penalty. Meanwhile, some restrictions have been strengthened a bit more by paying, however, its effect is not able to prohibit the driver from aggressive driving. Therefore, some people want to make new policies rather than restraints. For instance, an incentive system will be able to dilute criminal acts such as overspeed or signal violation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the imposition of fines for out of driver's senses is a vital role in a constitutional state, especially related to people's lives. If they have to pay a dozen of money, they make an effort to follow the rule. For example, when people drive on highways, they tend to adhere to guidelines because they do not want to pay fines for slowing down if there is a speeding camera. Additionally, if significant laws exist like cancellation of a driving license, they will keep in mind several regulations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, for the aforementioned reasons, I agree with this opinion as people must have impartial rules and restrictions to protect people from aggressive drivers.",

        "essay": "Many people argue that government can get involve in sorting out housing shortage in cities which has led to several social problems. While I agree to this sentiment in general, it is important to understand the limits of state intervention on this issue. I will discuss my reasons in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several factors behind housing problems in many countries. Foremost, the increase in population in some cities have a direct impact on this situation. Consequently, the limited resources available in cities such as land, water and food availability does not matched with the increase in demand. Therefore, it is the duty of the state to find solutions to this, in order to minimize social consequences. A good example, is health officials can take steps to encourage couples to have family plans that do not become a burden to the city, they live in. On the other hand, the government can implement efficient housing schemes in their countries with the help of international agencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are other parties that can solve these issues effectively. For instance, media professionals have a bigger role to play in this kind of a situation. Actually, they can assist public health officials to educate people on family planning by promoting several programmes in this regard. Moreover, certain charity and non government agencies can provide additional funds to authorities to build appropriate housing complexes in populated cities. In addition, academic professionals can help the state to planning of such housing projects in more environmental friendly way.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that limitations of government agencies can be easily overcome by third parties such as media and academic communities to overcome housing shortages in a country. This question, reminds us of citizen's responsibilities towards society as well.",

        "essay": "Some say that publicity causes positive economic effects, while others would argue that announcements are bad for society since they will make people feel unsatisfied with what they are and what they have. This essay will argue that although advertising captures consumers’ minds, a company’s economy will increase.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, all publicity will exaggerate how is the product and try to tell the consumers that their product is the best, and they should have it. This is a way of getting more clients, but sometimes the advertising uses incorrect words and expression to persuade people to buy their products, which harms individuals' heart, and make them doubt  themselves  if they are really  what the announcement says. For instance, there are many announcements that  say that the ones who are watching the advertising are nothing,  they need to consume the company’s product to make the individual happier and have a higher social status. However, I believe that this is easy to solve  since most people know what the companies are trying to do, and they are very self-confident, so are not affected by what others say.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, companies will invest in advertisements so they can reach more people. This is because almost everyone will use their mobile phone to watch social media, and if companies insert publicity in these pages, more people are able to know the company and the products they sell. Even though maybe at the time they do not need to buy products,  people will remember the announcement and can search for it in the future. Also, now all social media have a technology that knows what the user likes and what you need, so they will recommend related products. This will cause an increase in the company’s economy. For instance, people using Instagram can watch several advertisements when watching the histories and photos uploaded by their friends, also the application has a dedicated tab for sales. I believe that advertising products allow more individuals to know about products that some brands sell.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some announcements use the wrong way to persuade people to buy their product, the Internet and technology that there are now  will directly recommend the individuals what they want, increasing the number of sales, and this is why I think that advertising will better the economy.",

Firstly, with social economic development, people start to pay more attention to their culture life, of which the history of buildings is an interesting part. Secondly, cities and countries see more imigrations nowadays, and these people are not familiar with the culture of the places they move to. Therefore, it would be a good start to learn about the history of the houses they are living in. For example, I was told my dormitory was actually built on the site of a palace of the Tang Dynasty when I moved to my university in the ancient city Xi’an. It made me really excited and then I spent a large amount of time effort to find information about it. Finally, for business men, a profound history might make a location more valuable so that they can sell the houses for a better price.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to search the history of a building.

        "essay": "When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. Even though there are some benefits of working straight after school, I believe that going to college or university is the better option.\r\nThere are several reasons why people believe that getting a job is the better choice. First, they could earn money on their own without their parents’ financial support. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. Second, people who choose to start their career early instead of going to university or college can have more opportunities to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. Therefore, this may bring out a good chance of getting promoted to higher positions such as managers or executives.\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.",

While it is possible for mundane work to be carried out by robots, I believe certain jobs requiring human touch will still be performed by people. This essay will discuss some of the tasks that will and will not be taken over by automation.\r\n\r\nDue to robots' precision ability, they have the capacity to carry out unskilled work. In production, the use of machines has helped companies to cut costs, save time and increase profitability across many industries. For instance, in the electronic industry, microchips are pre-dominantly assembled by machines for many years and can hardly be seen involving human labour. This is because the line of work usually involves a high level of precision and speed which people may not be able to keep up with. Furthermore, some other industries that automation can potentially take over include the military, as well as food and beverages.\r\n\r\nAlthough machines are programmed to be highly intelligent, certain tasks requiring human skills, such as mental intelligence and human interaction cannot be performed by them. For example, doctors and surgeons are positions that can only be carried by highly-trained individuals. While machines can be precise in how they operate, they are unable to interact with patients or account for the patients' feedback during a doctor's appointment session. As a result, misdiagnosis can happen and is detrimental to the patients. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though the use of robots will increase significantly to increase productivity in the future, human intervention in certain areas is still essential to ensure adequate human interaction.

Having childrens in later stage may pose a risk to the mother because they may not be healthy enough to give birth to child. These may result in birth of a child with abnormal syndrome. For example, a research published in gynegology has found that females giving birth after the age of 35 years are highly prone to give birth to a diseased child.\r\nFirstly, primary reason behind planning children in later stage is that these days people are becoming more career oriented.

In this essay, I will analyze the feasible effects this growth can bring to the nation at present and future in terms of merits as well as demerits.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the pattern observed has its own results in the present. On the positive side, as the number progresses to be high the government is enforced to provide better sanitation facilities for the kids, since the kids are more vulnerable to diseases. This will not only benefit the younger ones but also the adults by providing them with good medical facilities. However, looking at the other side, the public bodies will have to spend more on the resources such as food and education. This can cause a considerable amount of stress for them in terms of financial aspect, which can eventually lead to an increase in the tax collection that affects the public.\r\n\r\nMoving further ahead and thinking about the consequences of the future, there will be a good revampment in terms of the nation's infrastructure development in numerous fields including internet, business and health. This is due to the fact that there will be a plethora of educated people with a specialization in a variety of fields. Contradictorily, the more number of educated youths can lead to an adverse situation namely unemployment. As the count of the competent persons in a domain is more, the most skillful ones will end up with a job.

        "essay": "The Tech industry employs a significantly large workforce in India, especially the youth. Although this is true, the picture is skewed when we look at the gender distribution of jobs, with only 20% of them being held by females. This essay elaborates on the problems that prevent more women from getting these jobs and gives some practical solutions to the issue.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the problems, most technology giants have their offices in metropolitan cities like Banglore, where people stay in nuclear families. So the responsibility of the household chores and children ends up on the shoulders of the woman in the family due to the absence of the elder generation in the house. Thus, they end up having less time for their professional work and end up leaving their spot. This reduces their number in employment significantly. For example, my aunt, a software engineer had to resign from her job when my cousin was born as she had no one to look after the baby. Secondly, in this society with a patriarchal world view, women are still viewed as less efficient and less worthy as compared to their male counterparts and are always second on the priority list while getting a job or a promotion. For instance, the majority of sales directors of most multinational companies are men for the same reason. \r\n\r\nA possible solution that can be offered, to tackle these issues is that huslabels take up the responsibilities of the house and free up the woman's time. For instance, my aunt's huslabel changed his place of employment so that she could work as well. In addition to this, awareness needs to be created that females are equally efficient, if not more at handling all tasks.

        "essay": "It is often believed that the planet is more impacted by the people who have expert knowledge in physical or natural science, while others argue that it is generally influenced by persons, who are especially involved in politics. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the former view.  \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, those who believe legislative can have a significant impact over the globe is likely to be limited. Although the prominent law-making decisions and international treaties between neighbour countries could be build-up by the specific politicians,  it would be helped to their citizens of the particular country. To illustrate this, the economic policies of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh has brought up INDIA way  in the eyes of the whole world, but the most might be benefitted by this are their permanent residences. Therefore, their impact applies to among people of the country merely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would argue that scientists can be hugely impacted in many countries as compared to politicians. This reason behind this is that their advancement in technology and medical science may provide assistance to a large number of people, which are also included public servants, who tend to use their unique inventions and upgrade to the country equipment such as fighter jets and satellites. For instance, the Internet and the Mobile phones are the best ever inventions made by Vinton Cerf and Martin Cooper which are used by people of every corner of the earth. It can be reached to a million people and this may result become more influential.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the politicians of specific country impose the significant rules and regulations on their citizens, which are quite helpful for them but it is limit to some extent because they are not as influential as technological experts which are impact more on the people of the world.",

        "essay": "The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.",

        "essay": "The government spends a significant amount of money on different areas, including the arts, health services, and education systems. In some countries, the government pays more attention to the arts, and some people think this is a positive trend, but others believe that money should be spent on  alternative areas, such as health, or education. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my point of view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, funding the arts could benefit economically to the country because it is one of the main aspects of international tourism. One of the primary reasons for travelling overseas is the fact that tourists are always interested in foreign museums, theatres and other artistic facilities. Therefore, if the government spends more wages to develop and maintain its art fields, for instance, the country will make more profit, leading to an improved economic condition. The more money will spend on the arts, the more economic growth will occur.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are other areas that need more funding, including health and education. The prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, is increasing these days, causing financial problems for the citizens. For example, the number of people who suffer from these health issues can be reduced if the authorities focus on public health and spend more money to prevent public from the diseases. In addition, improving the education system may be crucial for the younger, who is the key to developing the country. Thus, I strongly believe that spending a sufficient amount of money on health and education will be more advantageous for the country in a long run. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although spending money on the arts will benefit in terms of economy, it will lead to  more positive consequences if the government spends more money on health and education. I feel that this will be the optimal way to make the country a better place to live.",

        "essay": "In the modern digital era, many get the experience of violent entertainment in form of movies and games. While some believe that this experience is harmless and should be allowed to feel without any restrictions, my belief is that it should be censored to some extent to avoid harm to  society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many argue that there is insufficient data to link violent entertainment to actual crimes. Most of the viewers or subscribers just require the temporary thrill and excitement which does not extend beyond that limit. Moreover, the young generation will be aware of the consequences of crimes through this mode of entertainment and highly likely to obey rules and behave as a good citizen. In addition, some may control their anger or stress by playing a shooting game rather than doing actual harm to anybody. Furthermore, researches indicate that violence received by these modes of entertainment help to balance hormone levels inside the human body as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, viewing such violent content without discretion can cause several harms to  society as well. Firstly, children are likely to be impacted by this violent entertainment and can try to imitate what is being done in a movie or a game. This can lead to an increase in future crimes. Secondly, people with risky health conditions such as heart diseases could have issues if harmful content is not censored from movies or games. Hence, it is required to govern and regulate violent modes of entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though there are positive outcomes of not censoring violent content of entertainment, the damage it does to  society is unacceptable. In my view, governing bodies should involve and frequently monitor these entertainment modes, especially in developing countries like Sri Lanka.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, most young people work tirelessly to accomplish certain goals. Certain individuals opine that this has bad attributes compared to good ones whereas some oppose this idea. I, however, think that duties given to children yield good results than bad. The essay below will discuss both views at length.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, children need to be groomed for any life opportunities and uncertainties. Parents, relatives and even guardians do not live internally, for this reason, it is a great idea to give adolescents more work to do as a way of training them for the future.  Besides, nowadays most adults are in the diaspora searching for greener pastures. Thus children are left living by themselves with no adult supervision. For example, a study in Ghana showed that about thirty-two per cent of the child-headed families were responsible and able to fend for themselves because their deceased parents had taught them the survival skills. Therefore,  I agree that more responsibilities should be given to the youth as it may have a positive impact in the future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  some people think that giving more duties to children has negative effects. They mention that too much work will disturb their progress at school. I think this view is invalid because studying does not mean someone should not do other chores. For example, it was proved by Stanley Lee in his book ,\" Dustless child\" that many learned youths are unable to do house chores. He puts the blame on parents who were reluctant to teach them essential responsibilities such as washing and cooking. Thus, I support the idea that more duties should be given to young people as it might benefit them in life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree that children should be given more work to do as it may help them in the future although others think this will have a negative impact on their studies. These and other issues have been discussed in the above essay.",

This essay will elaborate on the reasons why more and more people are craving to find out the history of their residences and suggest some potential methods to research this.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a number of factors associated with people finding their houses’ history. The first reason is that people want to make sure about the safety of their residential area. For example, if there was any criminal in the buildings, then some people might consider moving out regarding the feeling of insecurity. Secondly, another factor is a dweller might look for some entertaining stories to share with their friends. To explain, there are many movies whose plots were inspired by an old accommodation, so it might sound interesting to know the story of our own.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a variety of means to explore the facts of one's houses or buildings. The easiest way is to ask residents in the same neighborhood who has been living there for a longer time. It is a fact that the witnesses on the scene are the best people who can offer the most reliable information. Furthermore, another source that should not be neglected is the internet. For example, if there was some news about the place, it should be shown in the search engines.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people might search for the history of their places to make themselves comfortable to live or only just for fun, and I am of the opinion that the best way to find the answer is to ask the locals or search on the internet.",

Personally, I completely agree with this view as described in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people who participate in community activities have more opportunities to meet a lot of people from different regions and backgrounds. They can see all aspects of life through which they will learn how to communicate with different people, have compassion for each other, and how to work in a group. Besides that, participating in volunteer activities is the perfect time for children to develop skills such as time management, communication, and problem solving, which are strong points for them to compete with other candidates when looking for future work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it also brings a lot of benefits to the community. Firstly, the local government does not need to spend the budget to hire people to do community work. They may spend those funds on health or education investments. Secondly, young people's participation in volunteering helps reduce the number of crimes and robberies in the country. For example, taking part in community activities helps them raise awareness and stay away from illegal activities and the community will get quality citizens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think parents should encourage their teens to take part in the activities of serving the community in their free time. because it has a great advantage both for society and for adolescents.",

        "essay": "Opinions differ when it comes to whether or not parents should have babies late in their life. While this has several benefits, I believe that overall the drawbacks are greater.\r\nAdmittedly, having children late allows parents to provide their youngsters better living conditions. In contemporary society, many couples decide to focus on their careers instead of having babies early. This decision might allow them to earn a decent job before they embark on parenthood. In other words, by the time their children are born, they are safe in the knowledge that they would not face any financial problems. Take my sister Trang and her huslabel as an example. They both agreed that their career should be prioritized to build a stable financial background for child-rearing. Therefore, they delayed their parenthood until 10 years after their marriage just to make sure their children grow up in good conditions.\r\nDespite the benefit mentioned above, I believe that having babies late cause detrimental effects. The chief of reason is that parents who have babies late could hardly understand their children. It is the generation gap that prevent those parents from fathoming their children. In other words, their obsolete way of thinking could not be applied to their children. This issue creates considerable distance between parents and their children. As a result, children might neglect the instruction of their parents and tend to become recalcitrant people. In contrast, if the generation gap is not too big, parents could articulate their thoughts to the children easily. As a result, they would easily find a suitable way to educate their children properly.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that having children late in life has more problems than benefits. It is therefore important that parents should consider the option of having babies early in their life.",

Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.\r\nInitially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.\r\nIn contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities.

In my opinion, this can be attributed to several causes and there are several possible measures to implement.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, our unconscious behaviours often bring about a traffic jam.  People tend to drive at a peak time without  consideration, which ends up creating long queues for a similar destination. To solve this,  the only logical action is to slightly change the time schedule and  avoid rush hours. There is no benefit to being in a long tailback.

In fact, some thoughtful people leave their homes  in the early hours and spend about half a day at  Tokyo Disney Land.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the delay in road maintenance also creates congestion in countries with various natural disasters such as Japan, or China. Frequent earthquakes make cracks on the road surfaces and require repairs for a while, from which . traffic jams inevitably arise To overcome this situation, constant road checks by authorities can be one solution. They inspect important roads  at night and find the possible flaws  at an early stage, which diminishes the timespan of repairing. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, traffic problems are mainly caused by unthoughtful actions and road repairs, and the solutions would be optimal private planning or constant road inspection.",

While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American culture’s trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Year’s Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",

        "essay": "Nowadays online traveling and research in natural environments, like the South Pole, became possible. It' is often argued that there are some benefits and drawbacks of this type of journey. I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.\r\nFirst of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.\r\nOn the other side, Web net based journey might be good alternative for those tourists who want to explore world but can't spend more money or resources on that journey. In this case remote journey is beneficial for both sides: for the natural environment which is staying safe from tourists' crowds interference, and for the tourists as well, as they shouldn't spend more resources on this kind of traveling. For instance, if person showing willingness to see the natural environment such as rainforest but can't travel, this type of the tourism might be the great chance. Though new technologies allow to see and even listen the natural environment voices whole, however real feelings and emotions of being for instance in the Southern Pole impossible to recieve when you are online.\r\nIn conclusion, there are some benefits and disadvantages of the remote traveling and research work that should be taken into consideration. I recommend scientists and tourists first of all to set their traveling goals and then analyze which type of traveling is more convenient for them.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "It is often argued that voluntary work should be compulsory for teenagers to get benefits from both the individual and society as a whole. I completely disagree with the opinion and think that we should not force the youths to do unpaid work.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe that imposing the ounpaid work on the teenager can cause more burden on them for their studies, which may pit adverse effect on their health too. As we know, there is a lot of syllabus in school; However, after coming back from school, young ones have to do their homework with numerous assignments and projects at home. Whenever they get leisure time, we should encourage them to utilize that period by doing physical exercise and playing sports otherwise, they may become unhealthy. For instance, In Canada, the students who are working in stores have been seen showing less progress in studies as compared to those who do not need to work. That is why Instead of compelling them to work, we should be given the time to concentrate on studies to accomplish outstanding grades.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, so do not believe that society and teenagers would gain any advantage by doing unpaid work.  It would be unfair for youngsters and society to do anything without their willingness, as it can lead to resentment amongst young people who would feel that they were being used. Furthermore, it is also against our democratic rules of the nation, which would increase the rate if crime in countries. For example, it has been seen that forcefully work causes rebellious in youths which put a negative effect on our society. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that volunteer work should not be mandatory for teenagers because it badly effects on their education and even on our society.",

        "prompt": "Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree)",
        "essay": "Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what label 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS label 9.",

        "essay": "Parents want their children to succeed in life and as a result, they always motivate their children to spend more time in physical activities, such as sports and yoga, as compared to studying. Physical activities do have their obvious advantages but in my opinion, studying is equally important and the following arguments will prove this.\r\n\r\nThere are countless advantages of physical activities which include but are not limited to sports, yoga, meditation and dance. First and foremost, these activities increase endurance and stamina, and improve blood and oxygen flow which in turn, increase the body's strength and mental focus. Moreover, consistently exercising these activities on regular basis boosts immunity and eliminates the cause of common diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure and many more. Furthermore, bodily chemical fluids released are essential for the body's functioning. For instance, melatonin is responsible for inducing sleep and not doing any physical tasks is the root cause of insomnia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, education is equally important. Being able to read, write and comprehend solves most of the daily problems one encounter and additionally, it makes you astute and improves your problem-solving ability. Moreover, it boosts one's self-confidence and adds to one's personality. For example, imagine a renowned athlete struggling to speak in front of media reporters. Lastly, in my opinion, being able to educate oneself and have the financial freedom to pursue studies in a field of one's choice is a privilege and everyone should leverage it to its maximum as it does not harm in any way and is always a cherry on the cake.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the importance of physical activities is at par with book education. From my perspective, parents should never give high weightage to either studies or physical activities and always strike a balance between both. Having said that, I do not agree that guardians should motivate their children to study less compared to physical exercises.",

        "prompt": "Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?",
        "essay": "There has been an ever-increasing trend that people discard an excessive amount of food waste from all corners of the world. Although, this problem can be attributed to a great number of reasons, some feasible solutions can be considered to address this.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons for this adverse tendency. The first reason for the rise in the amount of food waste is the increased supply of cheap and readily available food, which encourages people to buy more than they really need. For example, in order to increase sale revenue as well as compete with other brands, many fast food restaurants nowadays have lauched plenty of promotion programs such as “By 2 get 1 free”, which has attracted hundreds of customers and thus the huge amount of food waste will end up in landfills. Another reason is that in order to deal with busy lifestyles, people tend to buy food for the whole week rather than go to the supermarket on a daily basis. However, some kinds of fruits and vegetables easily become rotten within a few days and then thrown away.\r\n\r\nA wide range of strong measures must be implemented, not only by the government but also by individuals, to combat food waste. This first solution is that the government can develop some action plans to raise consumers’ awareness of food appreciation. This could be done by getting people involved in global food campaigns such as Think.Eat.Save and anti-food waste campaign, helping their citizens to become more conscious consumers and when everyone is fully aware of this, they would think more carefully when it comes to shopping for food. In terms of each consumer, it is important to make a detailed shopping list before going to the supermarket. This way helps them to have time to prepare and decide wisely what products should be bought, which eventually saves a lot of unnecessary food.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Although food waste seems inevitable in today’s world, there are various way to improve this problem.",

        "prompt": "Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?",
        "essay": "Nowadays, due to a wide range of education methods and systems, there are a lot of opinion and debates for which being the best orientation for students. Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.\r\nFirst of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.\r\nConversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.\r\nIn summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part.",

        "essay": "In present days , most students are having concentration issues during their classes. Even though they try hard to focus on their lectures but failed to achieve it. This essay will discuss the probable reasons for this condition and also the methods to eradicate it from the roots.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, In this fast-paced world people have no time for their mental relaxation due to their work commitments and personal life and this is the case with children as well. Also , there is so much peer pressure to do best in the business which leads to unnecessary anxiety. Secondly, Parents are also responsible for it, as they are the ones who force their kids to participate in certain competitive exams and crack them with good marks which in return gives a kind of burden to the young minds which disturbs their thinking and analytical capabilities. for example , every year approximately 10 lac students appear in a national level engineering entrance exam and medical entrance exam and for ,that they mugged up the syllabus of three major subjects for whole 2 years without knowing that if it will be beneficial for their practical life or not. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for unattentiveness is the monotonous teaching style of the teachers and more emphasis on  theoretical subjects and homework rather than explaining practical aspects and technical skills. For instance, in the ongoing curriculum in India , 80 % of the syllabus demands memorizing the textbook and writing it down in the exam, only 20 % syllabus includes practicals that too in the laboratory only. \r\n\r\nTo amend this condition we  have a plethora of options such as using engaging teaching methodology for that nowadays there are so many 3 D diagrams and animations available on the internet  if teachers use them to demonstrate the topic definitely it will engage students . Moreover, conducting morning meditation sessions in the first period will help students to calm their minds and help them to concentrate more in their classroom.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say that students are like clay , we can mould them however we want. children have issues with inattentiveness but to overcome it our pattern of classroom teaching should be evolved and parents should avoid giving mental pressure to their kids.",

        "essay": "The importance of punishment in juvenile crime has become an increasingly debatable topic in modern societies,  with conflict views on whether children themselves or their parents should be punished.  From my point of view, while parents play the pivotal role in moulding the development of young children, it seems still important for children themselves to be held responsibilities for their illegal behaviours.\r\n\r\nAdvocates for punishing parents point out the importance for parents to educate their offspring and the potential outcome of reducing the possibility for children to do anything illegal. The primary cause of this method is to give parents more responsibilities for their children’s behaviours. Parents, consequently, would teach their children about the basic laws in our community and ensure them forming a strong law-abiding consciousness. Meanwhile, whenever children intend to commit crimes, they would consider that it is their parents who will undertake the consequence. As a result, children may stop having illegal behaviours if they take care of their family members. \r\n\r\nHowever, only when disruptive children being punished will they learn the severe outcome of committing crimes. Foremost, different kinds of punishments play a deterrent role in educating young offenders about the importance of respecting the laws.  During the process of being sentenced, for example, young criminals would understand the responsibility they need to take as a citizen in a community. While it sounds like a strict way to teach children, over the long run, it is beneficial to their personal developments. It would narrow the odds of re-offending and prevent children from embarking on a criminal path after them being liable for the illegal behaviours made by themselves. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although punishing parents may be helpful in family education, I firmly believe it is necessary to enforce children being punished when they have committed crimes. It is the most effective way to educate children from being responsible for their behaviours, trying to eliminate the possibility of re-offending.",

This essay will decipher the role of government and highlight apt approaches by which this problem can be sorted out.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, authority’s role in demand and supply of housing is undisputable. Since the politics has the ultimate right in the land management with huge resources of budget. It is quite easy for authorities to build affordable inexpensive houses at a very less EMIs for low incomed people in order to meet the requirement of public housing around the cities. Moreover, higher officials can help the foreign and private sector companies to move in the rural areas so that suburban dwellers do not have to commute to the centre of the city for work, which would reduce the density of metropolis.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is the responsibility of the leaders of a country to help their disadvantaged citizens to have a certain degree of standard of life. Thereby, special subsidized schemes for housing should be implemented for the poor people to provide them housing facilities at spending a little amount of money. Also, the market price has been manipulated by the foreign or private sector investors, government intervention should be in place to discourage these investors from purchasing land other than for non- residential purposes. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, higher officials being the ultimate power can solve this problem and easily meet the requirement of affordable housing all round their country.

        "essay": "These days in the modern world, individuals waste a myriad of money on their youthful appearance. I assumed that this is happening due to the huge amount of advertisements and the inner instinct of being praised for their beauty. So I found it detrimental to the health and self-confidence of society.\r\n\r\nCosmetic industries, like any other industry, catch people's attention through ads. Any company strives to compete with others by illustrating younger models who are beautified with the company's products. This may increase not only the beauty standards but also mislead people about the fact that beauty means youth. Consequently, people would splurge on cosmetic products to modify themselves with such standards. Moreover, everyone yearns to be praised for their beauty. Even though all people are aware of their official age, they will be grateful if somebody admires their physical appearance and tell them that they look young for their age. Individuals who are getting on a bit may hear this admiration less, so they would purchase cosmetic products or even do some aesthetic facial surgery to look younger.\r\n\r\nThe detrimental effects of this tendency are that it may reduce the social health status. to illustrate, some people may undergo unnecessary plastic surgery or buy cosmetic products to catch up with the trend of being young, so this may have hazardous side effects like emboly and skin disorders. On the other hand, the fashion of looking younger could have a negative influence on people experiencing their aging naturally. For instance, they might lose their self-confidence when they compare themselves with others.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there is a piece of evidence explaining that advertisements and people's need for praise cause the trend of being young, which is harmful to people's health and mental status.",

        "essay": "Owing to the different physical and mental abilities of men and women, it is often argued by some people that different genders are best suited for different jobs. I completely agree with this statement and will discuss it further.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, as physical abilities of both sexes are different, where men are considered to be dominant in that area and women more fragile, jobs involving more physical activities, such as lifting of heavy bodies, are best suited for men. For instance, men are expected to join the armed forces and military jobs because it involves a great amount of physical work and living in secluded places for a long time, which might be a difficult task for women as women are comparatively supple mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is evident that the women are better suited for creative works such as artists and literature professors or teachers. Hence, more ratio of girls is more inclined towards studying art subjects than boys. As it is a psychologically proven fact that the part of a human brain, which controls a person’s artistic behaviour is stronger in women than men, this choice is expected. For example, 65% of the artists in the world are women, while men are just 35%.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as men and women's bodies and brains are made differently to work in different situations, I firmly agree with the argument that they are better suited for different kinds of jobs. Therefore, men are suited for jobs involving heavy power work and women innovative and artistic jobs.",

        "prompt": "Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements?\r\nWhat measures can be taken to protect them?",
        "essay": "Over the past few decades, because of the growth in competition among companies, customers are forced to watch advertisements for their products and services. Due to these competitive advertisement campaigns, a sheer number please are influenced by their content. The underlying problems along with feasible solutions to tackle the detrimental effects of product videos are analysed in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nFirstly, different strategies adopted by companies to attract more customers have influenced almost every group in our society. To explain further, even though these companies focus on boosting their revenue, they inject false and exaggerated ideas about their products. For instance, certain companies list their products as number one among others and claim that they are using natural products to attract more buyers. In contrast, they find loopholes in the law to slide through the complications of further complaints regarding their videos. Moreover, nowadays many pharmaceutical companies are targetting toddlers and mothers, and they have almost become successful. Today, rather than feeding homemade clean edibles to the kids, parents tend to provide pediatric supplements by the influence of promotional videos. Therefore, not only parents but also their offsprings believe that those products are better. Hence, a large number of people get scammed by such product based footages.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are various plausible measures to protect customers from getting mocked by these companies. First and foremost, governments should monitor and impose robust rules to evaluate the genuinity of every advertisement that pops up on the screens. Although promotional footages are necessary for legit companies to list and promote their products and services to the public, such strong rules might restrict fake and phishing content from appearing on the tab. Furthermore, the consumer court should form a branch which tests and research every single product that gets showcased in supermarkets as well as on internet pages to determine their quality of them. As a result, most of the unwanted clips of certain products as well as services might be avoided by replacing them with solid products.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the influence of advertisement is an acute problem, because it induces impacts on the preferences of people when purchasing. Although the challenges are improbable to be eradicated within a short span, there should be concrete measures from the legal side to mitigate the adverse effects.",

        "essay": "Generally, sports are more attractive among young children when compared with education.Few parents believe that sports impact studies of children positively.However,some people oppose the argument. In my opinion, sports help students to perform well with their education.Both views are discussed on the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, physical activities such as sports improve student's studies. When students are involved in sports competitions, they tend to use both body and mind to compete with opponents.Thus, skills such as quick decision making, time management, resource management skills are enhanced. This help them to use similar tactics or methods learn faster with academic modules. Further, sports competitions help teenagers to manage stress as they have perform witin a stipulated time. As a result, they could follow same apporach when they do an exam.\r\n\r\nApart from some of the positive points mentioned above,there are negatives too. When students get attracted to sports , they tend to forget other important tasks such as learning or accumulating knowledge. Some students do not complete the education because they deeply involved in sports competition. In addition the previous point, curriculum in the academic modules do not have direct relationship with sports. For example,  sports will not provide practical experience against certain modules such as history, arts and music as they have to be learned by practising,researching and visiting to respective ancient history locations. Therefore,  students will find difficult to balance between academic education and sports.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in above paragraphs, sports make students to learn better by improving their skills and managing stress. Hence,it is clear that sports have strong positive impact on  student's studies \r\n\r\nand negatives could be managed by striking a balance between education and sports.",

        "essay": "In today’s world, there have been enormous investments in the technology industry. Space science has been the most popular and expensive field. However, there is a debate regarding the spending amount of money since people believe that this money can use in other fields which give more benefit to humanity. I completely disagree with this opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, exploration  out of the world is significant for human’s future since World Space Agency (WSA) research shows that resources of the earth start to decrease because of some situations such as overpopulation or excess use of the car. In addition, another survey which is also done by WSA in 2020 published that people will suffer from a lack of clean water next few decades. For this reason, scientists begin to search for another planet like our world to maintain human life in the future. Therefore, the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment. \r\n\r\nSecondly, recently earth has been the only known planet for life since humans have not  totally explored the other part of the universe. In other words, there may be some intelligent creatures in some parts of the space. Anyone does not know  whether they will threaten people’s life or not. In addition, some natural planet disasters can occur such as meteor crashes, and thanks to research, undesirable results may be avoided. As a result, humans should spend more money on space fields to protect themselves from unknowns.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Although there are different notions on space exploration investments, I think that these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area.",

        "prompt": "Education for young people is important in many countries. However, others think government should spend more money for education in adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "In our modern life, educating  the younger generation is more significant  as compared to  illustrating maturity.While many people hold the view that the authority ought to  expand its resource in educating old people . I vehemently disagree with that position. This essay will discuss the benefits of  investing in the education of the younger population and the demerits of prioritising educating adults.  \r\n\r\nTo begin with, young people can learn  academic knowledge more easily This is because, at this age, they can give their best output in terms of their studies. These younger folks are not distracted by family or job-related stress and they mostly do their best in order to succeed academically whilst the adult in most cases would be occupied with family issues and  tend not to concentrate on their studies.For instance, it has been discovered that a significant majority of adults over 27 nearly never acquire the knowledge they learn in school. Additionally, the tax that adults pay to the government will increase if they graduate, get hired by a reputable company, and earn high salaries. The government would spend  sizable tax revenue to assist  underprivileged and uneducated adults. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,the youths find it easier to learn and comprehend new skills and ideas while it is difficult if not impossible for grown-ups to cope with learning.Because children explore more than adults, this helps them learn better than grown-ups, according to a recent study.The study notes when adults attempt something new but get a negative result, they usually won’t try it again.One of the co-authors, Dr Thorndike Gopnik, a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley, wrote, “That might seem like the most basic kind of intelligence—even rats stay away from a path that leads to a shock.”The downside, he  said, is if adults immediately reject something new after they get a bad result, “we will never learn that the world is more complicated than that.”Children,in particular, have an intense curiosity and drive to explore and this helps them learn so many different things  so quickly, according to the study. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  I  concede that  minors  bring more benefits to the economy of the society that in the future this may have a good effect on themselves and therefore the state authorities should pay more attention to juniors , as they are curious and explore a lot.",

        "essay": "It is true, that art is depicted as one of the most crucial directions in the Humanities section. However, some sceptics insist on how meaningless this subject might be for children. Personally, I would support the idea of merging the disciplines into an upscale program for talented individuals. In the other words, my opinion is based on finding the balance between these groups.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, not every child is keen on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. For example, according to the worldwide statistics, 60% of primary school students, mostly enjoy moulding the clay figures and draw, as long as it brings the flow of relaxation. It is widely known, that working with scientific papers and other practical materials requires a high level of stress and anxiety, while the art-related subjects help the pupils expressing their emotions and feelings to the fullest. Moreover, the whole process is operated by the sense of creativity, which is a must-have job qualification nowadays. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the parental concerns are welcomed to be acceptable, too. Although, the idea of releasing innovative potential may sound promising, the most desirable specialists in 2020 are the software and civil engineers. Having said that, the vast majority of adults are worried about the future perspectives of their children. Unluckily, hard work of, for instance,  graphic designers and book illustrators, is not being paid off well enough. Furthermore, a lot of artistic professions are not taken seriously and considered as not the best value for money, especially, for those parents, whose children are attending private schools.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both scientific and art directions should be highlighted as significant in 2020. I strongly believe, that despite their advantages and disadvantages, they can easily complement each other. In this case, the visual representation of objects can be a great inspiration for the future inventions.",

        "essay": "The  advent  of  versatile  machinery  significantly  influenced  the  life  of  both  the  affluent  and  less privileged.  Group  of  individuals  has  blamed  advanced  tech  to  be  the  crucial  factor  in  subdividing  classes  of  people,  whilst  the  others,  conversely,  claim  that  improved  technique  has  brought  people  together.  In  the  following  essay  I  will  discuss  both  views.\r\n\r\n    To  begin  with,  machinery  is   a powerful  issue  which  has  covered  the  whole  world.  As  shown,  automation  is  required  for  carrying  out  the  majority  of  not  only  daily  routine,  but  also  chores.  Furthermore,  currently,  all  services  are  linked  to  computers  and  the Internet. What  is   more,  desktops  or  other  gadgets  don’t  discriminate  between  their  users  and  don’t  classify   folks  by  social  strata.  If  people  can’t  afford  Internet  access,  there  are  Wifi-hotspots  which  are  available  at  railway  stations,  bus  stops  and  recreation  areas  are  available  at  free  of  cost  to  all people, in  the  society.\r\n\r\n    On  the  other  side,  although  there  are  affordable  techniques  for  every  community,  these  inventions  might  not  be  fully  accessible  to  certain  members  of  the  populace  due  to  the  expenses  needed  to  procure  them.  Additionally,  some  treatments  for  chronic  diseases  such  as  cancer, which  is  extensively  lethal  for  human,  include  high  cost  of  drugs,  which  can  be  afforded  only  for  the  wealthy.  Besides,  there  are  a  few  appliances  and  machines  like  last  updates  of  different  brands  of  Microsoft  or  car  companies  which  the  less privileged  can  only  dream  about  them.  Therefore,  this  is  the  basic  reason  to  increase  the  break   between  both  types  of  people.\r\n\r\n    To  sum  up,  according  to  my  viewpoint,  the  automation  has  broken  the  bridge  between  high-  and  low-  class  people  to  a  great  extent  that  presently  all  the  people  are  enjoying  all  the  amenities  that  they   require.",

        "essay": "Many think that, in contrast to the past, there is an increasing number of people who choose to have children later in life because of the changes in the roles of the individuals. In my opinion, the issue of bearing a child as older adults can bring more problems than its advantages.\r\nAdmittedly, there are some benefits of having children in older age. Firstly, it establishes emotional stability for individuals to raise their own young ones. This is because of the fact that the older a person is, they also become more mature in decision making, especially those that parents use. Secondly, adults having children later in life can have more financial preparation. Needs such as education, food and shelter can be costly and so, parents who decide to have children later on will have the advantage of saving up more money and be prepared for the future.\r\nNevertheless, I believe that, due to the changes in the roles of the individuals, having a child late in life can bring more drawbacks. One is that, because of women empowerment which allowed them to be employed, there are now delayed opportunities for most people having children at a younger age. This has caused fewer populations globally, which then could be a cause of human extinction in the years to come. Another problem of having kids at an older age is the increase in maternal deaths. Older pregnant women have higher tendency to develop pregnancy induced diseases, which can lead to reversible complications that could be detrimental to both mother and child. \r\nIn conclusion, the negative effects of having children later in life are far heavier than the minor benefits that it could bring to the family.",

        "essay": "These days, the thriving development of communication allows famous figures to reach audiences and inspire them. However, it is believed that at the moment, these household names should not become role models to current generations because money and glamor are foundation of this fame instead of achievements. From my perspective, this opinion is true to certain extent and I will explain my preference in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for many, this option is quite convincing because of several reasons. First, a significant number of celebrities are famous because of their talent and attainments. To be specific, civilians, who have an unfortunate background, attempt to work hard and make efforts to acquire achievements. Particularly, household names, who have actual talent, should become a good example for youngsters to follow. For instance, in Vietnam, Ha Anh Tuan is famous because of not only his excellent voice but also his integrity. Second, products or items, which famous individuals utilize, are bought by their fans. To elaborate, thereby, famous figures assist in promoting brands’ benefits. \r\n\r\nHowever, these arguments are insufficient to overshadow the drawback of the  topic in question. First and foremost, at the moment, the current generations’ standard to define the success of a citizen is inadequate. In particular, an individual, who just need the beauty and wealth, could prevail easily. Worst still, some civilians are popular because of their notorious actions. In addition, scandals are often more visual among junior citizens and this encourages them to follow. In fact, in Vietnam, an inordinate number of tiktok users posted ludicrous videos and encouraged children emulate them. \r\n\r\nIn short, celebrities who reach specific attainments in their career should become role models for youngsters to emulate and KOLs also help brands to increase their benefits. Nonetheless, because standard of junior citizens to determine the success of a household name weak, so notorious civilians also gain grounds and this is a bad example for children.",

        "essay": "Large companies recruit employees based on their performance in an interview. But some believe that there are better methods to select a person to be part of the company. I agree with the view that there are other reliable methods to assess a person for a job.\r\n\r\nOut of all the reasons, the foremost one is that a one-day event like an interview cannot provide adequate information about a person's professional skills. As interviews are held either in-person or through an online mode in some instances, the interviewee's stress levels  can interfere with their performance in the interview. On the other hand, an interview can, at times, give a deceptive picture even though he or she is not well suited for the company. For example, a person who can verbally convince the interviewer that they have the skills to be a software engineer, might not be efficient in situations that require one to function under pressure and meet deadlines.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I think that interviews are not an apt way of hiring an employee is that personal biases and the mental state of the interviewer at the time of the event can affect the outcome of the process.  For example, if the interviewer is biased toward individuals of a certain nationality or race, an ideal candidate might be missed out because of the negligent actions of the interviewer. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that I prefer a more reliable method than interviews to recruit an employee. This is because interviews cannot give an accurate picture of the applicant's professional skills and the personal biases of the interviewer can affect the outcome of the process. A better alternative to interviews would be to, filter out  individuals based on educational and professional qualifications for the job and evaluate them during a probationary period where tasks of varying complexities are used to assess the individual. This can give the company the exact representation of a person's abilities.",

I highly disagree that this is the best solution. This essay will discuss in detail the reasons why.\r\n\r\nNowadays, more and more cars are being produced by various companies. Moreover, due to cars becoming more affordable to the public, it leads to the increase of noise and air pollution. Firstly, a good solution is for the government to increase the tax on the car. Like for instance, in Singapore aspiring car owners need to bid for a Certificate of Entitlement to own a car. Also, owners need to surrender their cars after 10 years not unless they decide to renew their COE. Furthermore, the government limits the number of cars that run on the road to combat heavy traffic and pollution. Secondly, the government should build more sustainable-land transport hubs by expanding the availability of EV charging stations. In addition, having a bike lane may also encourage people to have their bicycles when going to work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while increasing the fee for fuels may sound to be a good solution  it will cause our normal citizens to suffer due to its domino effects such as increase in transport fees, price of goods that are being transported from other regions and so much more.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, increasing the fuel rate might help in decreasing the ever-worsening pollution, ,however there is much more effective ways to solve this dilemma like COE in Singapore, accessible transportation for the citizens and building more bike lanes.",

        "essay": "The essay below is a discussion on a common topic that arises often between people who live in big cities and those who stay in rural areas or rather small towns. Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?\r\nFirstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.\r\nTraffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.\r\nHowever, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.\r\nIn my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body.

On the other hands many singer earn incalculable money thanks to their concert. This singer or musician have a low opinion while some people downloads the their music on internet by illegal.

        "essay": "Due to easy access to the Internet, many academic institutes, and especially universities offer virtual courses instead of in-person classes. It seems to me that this should be considered as a possible development.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of online programs is that the students can attend the class from wherever they are comfortable ; therefore, the transportation charges for coming to the campus every day will be reduced. Also, the university doesn't have to pay extra charges for maintenance, power, etc. Hence, both the university and the students can save more time and money. Furthermore, these courses can be recorded and the students can rewatch the parts they missed during the class. They won’t be limited by the class hours and can study and work on the courses at any time of the day. Since the sessions will be recorded, teachers will be more careful about what they say during their presentations and can minimize potential mistakes.\r\n\r\nOnline courses can be beneficial for the teachers too. They can stay at home and prepare for their lectures and have more free time for responsibilities besides work. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, holding classes on campus might include some other benefits. First, the key advantage of in-person courses is the physical interaction between the teacher and the students. This can affect learning significantly. Moreover, asking questions and connecting with the class environment is less challenging in person and this help students to focus better and get on with the class easier.\r\n\r\nAlthough the specific views on this issue may vary from person to person, I believe that the advantages of online courses outway the disadvantages and therefore, this should be considered a development.",

Personally, this might also include both benefits and drawbacks that I will present in the following essay. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, studying online will have a number of advantages for learners during learning progress. Firstly, in terms of geographic distances, students could enrol in prestigious foreign universities whereas they do not need to go abroad. Therefore, those learners will be able to broaden their horizons regardless of where they come from as the convenience of online tertiary education. Secondly, they also do not need to care much about expenses related to renting houses or flight tickets, which help them to save a huge amount of money. Students, whose families often face financial burdens in daily life, could continue to pursue their dreams and enhance their career prospects. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, besides positive effects, online courses might be a poor substitute for traditional classes delivered at universities. These courses do not offer learners face-to-face interaction which is still important to their understanding of the lessons. In addition, this type of learning does not allow discussions between classmates either, and without peer support, students’ learning outcomes might be affected in an undesirable way. Furthermore, as a lot of self-discipline is required and there are so many distractions from the Internet while studying from an online website, students are more likely to procrastinate. This also contributes to lower results as students may tend to lose focus during the online lessons.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having online courses available to choose from while at university benefits students in a number of ways.

This is because they are accessible to all people due to their availability at cheaper rates. For example,  internet technology is available to all most places such as railway stations, parks and airport where WIFI hotspots are freely accessible. Besides, online shopping, e-learning opportunities and social networking websites are available for both the rich and the poor in the society, thus the gap between both two classes is worn away. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain advancements in technology are not affordable for the poorer sections of  society. For instance, not only modern medicine is expensive, but also certain new drugs and diagnostic procedures are very costly. Certain affluent people who developed cancer took treatment with a special kind of ingredient which was very expensive but had fewer side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy. Rich people can access these treatments by spending only a small portion of their income and improve their health. Poor people, by contrast, have to spend all of their money on conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that their condition will improve.\r\n\r\nAll in all, although certain innovations in technology decrease the gap between the wealthy and the poor while certain developments make more polarized. It is hoped that in the near future all technologies will be available for all residents regardless of their economic status.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.\r\nWhat are the reasons for this?\r\nHow can people research this?",
        "essay": "History is believed to be a crucial and controversial matter as it illustrates the identity of a place or a nation. It is often said that the vast majority of people are becoming curious about their bungalows or flats histories in contemporary countries. It would appear that there are two significant causes and a number of methods for realizing and searching about the history of their houses.\r\n\r\nFirstly, foremost among the other reasons is that families and households are more concerned about security than they used to be in the last decades, so they are becoming more protective. It means that households feel more secure by searching and realizing the background history of their buildings or houses. The second well-known stem would be that so vital is the history that hardly could anyone ignore it. For instance, as there are plenty of social media, some matters such as the history of the accommodation are becoming a trend so that families are inclined to find out about the history of their homes. \r\n\r\nTurning to possible approaches for researching this matter, it would appear that providing the accommodation was ancient, families would inquire from people living in their neighborhood for a long time about the history. The second method would be to take advantage of the internet and search about it as it contains endless minutiae about almost everything.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, security matters and social trends are the most significant causes, and asking neighbors or searching on the Internet would be ways to research the history of their houses or buildings.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, global-warming and environmental problems are big consarn and day by day it is increasing and as a result, many part of world's temperature is rising, rain is getting less and air and water are getting polluted. Some people believes that by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other private vehicles will help to fight with this environmental issues. I am disagree with this statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, increasing fuel cost will not solve the environmental problems, but it will create unbalance in society. People who have enough money they can still afford the costly fuel and roam anywhere they want. On other hand, people with low income will be deeply effected because this increases their overhead in monthly expenses. For example, rich people already buying the costly cars which are heigh fuel consumption, so they already afford car and fuel. On opposite site, average people chose fuel economic car to save fuel and it's cost.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, environmental problems not just cause by the fuel but there are many other elements also play a part in this. like chemical industry, their by-products pollute the water and many other industry burn coal which also effect to the environment. Instead of increase the fuel price, government and other organization should spread awareness of all this issue and plant more trees and save woods will be more effective.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, If increase in fuel price will create unbalance in society which only effect to average people and rich people still afford it. Though, environmental issues not just cause by fuel and there are many other factors responsible as well and awareness should be spread about it.",

        "essay": "The best solution to solve the world's environmental issues is to raise the price of fuel for motos and other private rovers. I strongly agree with this idea because people will select other transportation methods such as electric cars and public transportation.\r\n\r\nElectric cars have brought several positive advantages compared to ordinary fuel cars. It is undeniable that if governments are increasing fuel prices in their country then people will choose to buy electric cars instead of using patrol vehicles because they can save a large amount of money . In the US, for example , many people are choosing electric vehicles because they do not need to worry about maintenance fees and petrol costs.As a result , the government also can reduce fuel consumption within the country.\r\n\r\nSelecting public transportation can also be another option when authorities increase fuel rates.Undoubtedly, public transportation like trains and buses can carry  a large number of people in cities .Consequently, that can reduce air pollution in residential areas. \r\n\r\nTo conclude , increasing fuel prices for private vehicles can enable to use of electric cars and public transportation. I also believe this way can solve our environmental issues like air pollution in residential areas.",

        "essay": "Many people around the world have different opinions about whether kids should watch TV or not.\r\n\r\nSome think it is good for learning because technology is important nowadays. However, we can not ignore the negative effects of TV. In my view, it is important for kids to use TV for their mental growth.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, watching TV can be good for a child's brain development. It encourages them to think and come up with ideas, especially when they watch educational shows like \" Baby TV\". Some cases have even shown that kids can improve their grammar skills by regularly watching English programs. Additionally, TV can be a source of entertainment during the summer holidays. For instance, videos and cartoons are simple ways for to kids have fun. Screens play an important role in every child's growth and development.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many kids today are watching things on screen that may not be suitable for them. Grown-up shows are available for them to watch, and this can be a problem. A statistic survey that it took recently shows us that a big percentage of users on adult websites are kids between 9 and 14 years old. However, spending too much time on television is a waste of time from important things like helping with tasks at home. As a result, they can affect their behaviour and values in a negative way.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, watching TV can be really good for a kid's personal growth. When they watch educational shows often, it helps them feel more sure about themselves when they face problems in life. For example, when they see people have discussions on TV, makes them believe that their own ideas are important too.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, television can have positive effects on children in today's world, but we should not ignore the negative aspects. As a result, it is recommended that every child spends at least 30 minutes to an hour watching TV each day.",

        "essay": "These days, robotic science has achieved several advancements in creating robots and becomes part of our society ,However some people consider that they are necessary for the development of the future of humanity, on the other, hand some part of society has negative views about it. This essay will discuss the views of both viewpoints of society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, robots take up crucial functioning in many fields like medical, manufacturing, cinemas, packaging, space exploration, laboratory research and mass production of consumer and industrial goods which creates a better future for humans. Production cost is slashed with the inclusion of automatic and machine arms, as they reduced the requirement of labour in performing repetitive work for example assembling body parts of cars, assembling mobile parts, doing quality checks, etc. \r\n\r\nMoreover, critical surgeries which require precision and are vulnerable to human error like eye surgery, plastic surgery, and heart surgery seem realistic with the advancement of mechanical arms in medical science. Therefore they are able to serve our society in a better way for its future development.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, automation impacted adversely, as with the dependency on machines most of the production houses are adopting machines in place of humans for cost-cutting and to make cheaper consumer goods. Because of this most people are losing their jobs and becoming unemployed, which spread poverty and crime in society. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, robots play an important role in the areas of medicine and production ,However it has some adverse effect which needs to be controlled by the government by placing stringent rules on the use of automation in labour-influenced areas. Hence in my opinion they are undetachable arms for the growth of the human future.",

While a group of supporter asking government to encourage special skilled person by providing them several benefits, another group is opposing the same thing and stating that it is worthless to spend money on it. This debate is a hot potato these days in the market. \r\n\r\nIf we look at one side, the crowd of people who are against in dividing financial substitute, they might be arguing that provided fund should be allocated to the top most necessary things to mankind such as medical, food, and water crises. In the developing and poor country people are facing issues such as water pollution, hunger, low medical facilities. To come up from this issue it requires more investment in these areas. For example, in India, at the rural area, people are still facing problem of clean water. The government should focus on basic things first and should increase necessary structure. For instance, water purification plant. \r\n\r\nHowever, at the another side, the different arts such as painting helps people to enhance their creativity in their personal life. Making different arts and their role model popular, and providing them special benefits can increase interest in people’s life. For instance, in the United States of America, auction of painting happening frequently by government and the painting is getting sold in crores of dollars which can increase revenue of personal and government.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, the debate of allocating budget by government for the artist could be beneficial to the society or not? The consideration should be made after looking on the priority of the particular country’s economy.\r\n",

Maybe luck had some impact however the key factor is  perseverance. For example, most rich and successful communities, had a difficult way to  triumph, with a lot of failures and disappointment, but they  always worked really hard and achieved their aims.\r\n\r\n     Also, there  may be a lot of failures on the way to the aim, but it is important  not to give up, because life will get you tired however believing in yourself is very important.

        "essay": "These days, people sometimes argue that it is time-consuming to read newspapers or watch news programs because news is not associated with their lives. Personally, I completely disagree with this view due to several long-term benefits news brings to us.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons why I approve of this. The most frequently cited one relates to the strong relationship between individuals and the community. Apparently, the news presented on such means of mass media has a great impact on our lives. These are the current affairs that residents need to notice and take concern, from several local information such as education and lack of clean water to a variety of global issues, which are climate change or ozone depletion. Each one plays a significant role and we cannot deny their benefits to bring us a wide range of knowledge about the wider world.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it seems evident that news is an enormous source of information with  value  for citizens to anticipate and well prepare for their future. There are those who always keep up with the latest news and are ingenious  so that they can recognise the tendency of society to develop their own advantages. Furthermore, the news is a crucial need owing to its positive purposes. For example, good news may bring about a good sense of confidence and belief, while  bad ones may warn us about the barriers we have to tackle. As a consequence, we can find the most effective method to encounter these obstacles.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I believe that news has various merits in people’s lives, which are a useful source of information and the intimate knowledge we can learn from it.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, it seems more important for employers to consider the job applicant’s social skills before their academic records. In my opinion, I strongly disagree as not always good social skills are enough to complete a task satisfactorily, as well as having academic qualifications are not a guarantee of dealing with the job appropriately. I believe that the combination of both aspects should be the best criterion in order to select an employee.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, employing people based only on their social skills would probably be insufficient as they may not be well prepared to do the job. For instance, it has been claimed that, far away from being overrated, university studies are necessary for  society as many people are being formed in short Online courses trying to take faster paths to get a job while the truth is that 90% of them fail getting hired as they profiles are not enough to deal with all the situations of qualified jobs. This means that it is absolutely necessary having reliable qualifications that allow one to work professionally. However, I am not saying that only  academic records are enough, we all definitely need to have acceptable social skills if we really want to succeed in a working environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, considering the other extreme of only taking into account their academic records it also does not guarantee successful employment. For example, it has been proved that numerous business sales with competent personnel that were not kind enough at the time of dealing with people, were losing sales dropping their numbers considerably. This explains why it is important to understand that qualifications and social skills contribute equally to the performance of  a better job.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, employers who think that it is preferable having great social skills than to have professional skills are wrong, as considering one on top of the other, no matter which one is,  would decline in failure as both are truly important. In my opinion, I strongly believe that employers should consider both aspects in order to choose the best candidates,  which the criteria would be performing a good job while using their social abilities to interact with other employees and clients, working naturally as a part of a team.",

There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.\r\nTo begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.\r\nOn the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.\r\nHaving all the arguments above, I strongly recommend people spend their money on family celebrations enough to make family members satisfied.",

        "essay": "It has long been a subject of debate about where public funds should be directed, with some people advocating for the improvement of healthcare and others for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. However, in my opinion, it is more effective to address the root causes of illness rather than simply treating symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly strained the current healthcare system, leading to long wait times, high costs, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. While investing more resources into the treatment of the sick can provide temporary relief, it does not address the underlying problems. It is therefore important for authorities to identify and eliminate the root causes of illness in order to ensure a functional and sustainable healthcare system.\r\n\r\nOne effective way to reduce the burden on the healthcare system is to prioritize the prevention of diseases. For example, in the case of COVID-19, the health administration can implement measures to control the spread of the virus, thereby reducing the number of patients requiring medical treatment. Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence linking obesity to chronic diseases such as stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Governments can address this issue by imposing taxes on junk food manufacturers and encouraging the consumption of healthier foods, which can help to reduce the incidence of these diseases.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is important to support those who are already sick, it is equally important to promote healthy lifestyles in order to reduce the need for medical treatment in the first place.

However, others take a side of that people have become less independent with the advent of technology when compared to the past. In my opinion, the interconnectivity between people is increasing with technological breakthroughs . The aim of this essay is to discuss the argument with the merits and the demerits of this debate.\r\n\r\n On the one hand, there is a broad consensus amongst experts that current technological development such as the internet, mobile phones and applications have been bringing a revolution in the connection of humans. For this reason, reaching someone is easier like never before. With the development of the internet, everyone is interconnecting with each other and as a consequence of it, there is no doubt that the dependency amongst people is increasing. For example,  there are many voluntary work opportunities for travelling and meeting new cultures, which is why cultural convergence can go up amongst societies. Thus, doubtlessly the only thing that amongst people is physical borders nowadays. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people have assimilated a more individualistic approach in the current time due to the capitalistic world. The material consideration is increased for everyone and the main priority of people is to afford their fundamental needs first. As a consequence of it, people have become more competitive and less interconnected since the beginning of the industrial revolution. For instance, the main aim for many individuals is to gain social mobility for comfortable life, which is why it can be seen clearly,  all the opportunities that are provided in the modern times, however people ought to take care for themselves as the significant priority and for this reason people have been becoming more independent due to material consideration.\r\n\r\n To summarize, although  material consideration and competition cause more self-oriented behaviour amongst people, it is important to bear in mind that cutting-edge development has provided a paramount opportunity to connect with each other, which is why the connectivity is increasing exponentially.",

However, the solution of more plantations may not become possible due to excessive soil erosion and lack of land.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people believe that circumstances can be made under control if effective measures are taken right away.To begin with,if the community has already realised the value of planting trees , then the government should make provisions related to logging.Moreover , advanced technology can prove effective in protecting endangered animals.For example, China has been utilising genetic technology, especially to protect panda's life.Additionally , the crowd ought to be encouraged to plant more and more trees.Therefore , the adoption of these solutions can be helpful in tackling global concerns directly from the root level.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, indeed , human activities have resulted in causing numerous problems for living and non-living organisms.Yet , I believe plantations, advanced technology and strict rules and regulations are effective methods for solving this issue.",

The first point of prime importance is financial needs which makes them work the whole day like a machine in order to meet their fundamental household needs.

Therefore, to accomplish their target they spent long hours on office premises in order to attain that target on time.\r\n\r\nSome considered this change a positive while others think it is  a negative development.

This essay will discuss both of these arguments and emphasize on the view that teaching art at school should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nOne school of thought favors the opinion that studying art is a waste of time considering students are already burdened with studying many subjects at school. Additionally, the job prospects associated with art are very low which weighs down the popularity of choosing arts as a study subject. A recent survey in Australia suggested that almost 23% of students who majored in art from University of South Australia were not happy with the low paying opportunities. Such instances are a contributing factor to this belief of discouraging students from studying arts and opting for more job-oriented streams instead.\r\n\r\nAmong many things arts includes music, painting, various dance forms which represent a country’s heritage. Teaching art in schools should be encouraged to ignite interest of the young minds towards the same. Art is a way of expressing oneself and helps to broaden thinking of students. It may not seem luring with respect to job opportunities, but it is a good way of unwinding from stress of daily life. This leads to my opinion that arts should be taught as an optional subject and students can decide whether they want to pursue it professionally or as a hobby.\r\n\r\nPopularity of Art as a subject is declining day by day. This essay discussed the view that art as a subject is a waste of time but still it should be taught because even if a student does not take up a job in this field, he can develop a hobby based on interest",

        "essay": "Nowadays, artificial intelligence is starting to change many aspects of life in the world.One of these innovations is a robot and a lot of scientists made assumptions that many operations will be done by robots in the near future. In my view, this invaluable effect has certain negative and positive points simultaneously, which will be discussed in this essay.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage, what can i mention  it  is a fact that people can get free from wasting time on useless and petty work. Or conversely, saving workers from too dangerous operations. For instance, robots can work instead of employers who work in mountainous areas or toxic factories, where ordinary people are under the threat. Moreover, there are many establishments, where work must never stop and where robots can help a lot with their continuous work without interruption. As a result, production work will improve significantly.\r\n\r\nDespite positive facts, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, cases of unemployment will become greater. \r\n\r\nIf menial labour is done by robots, people without education will lose their jobs and poverty will comes.Subsequently, the demographic situation around the world will be deplorable. As a example, majority of people in Kazakhstan do not have professional degree and have to work in workplaces as wage-earners.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, besides many positive impacts people will be exposed by negative facts.",

        "prompt": "\"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.\r\n \r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"",
        "essay": "With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens.",

It is happening as this sector requires a twenty four hours support that is quite difficult for a lady because of their household duties. However, it can be resolved by bringing a flexibility in the work culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the major issues is working timing in the Information Technology department. To be more precise, this part of the organization needs to be supported  the whole day without any interruption to meet the client's requirements such as, hardware problems, software updating in the system, and giving the updates to the onshore business teams after every interval, therefore,  a company wants his respective staff to be present all the time to seek the possible solutions of every problem. Thus, women cannot play a vital role here, since they need to look after their family, namely feeding a baby, cooking meals for elders, helping children in their studies and so on. Thus, it is difficult for them to be available anytime to resolve the queries.\r\n\r\nOne of the possible outcomes, to eradicate this barrier a company has to revise his working routine to some extent. Simply stated, firms can provide a work from home policy so that  the female staff can utilize their travelling time to complete their domestic works, a play school policy to take care of their infants, and open window to log in and log out the system to endure their jobs. It can be a big aid for them to perpetuate the career without any tension.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, merely 20% IT jobs are occupied by a lady co- workers because of the improper office shifts.

We are going to take a look at the various reasons why people are interested in this history and what resources they use to get that information.\r\n\r\nWhy are some people so curious to know about the history of a place they reside in? The answer to this question is, the tendency of human beings to understand completely  the surroundings they live in. By learning about the history of a building they are living in people are indirectly learning about the socio-economic environment that existed in the society they live in, therefore, giving them more clarity about the locality. Another reason for digging up the past of a building is to make an emotional connection with the home, for instance, knowing about what the building was used for earlier or who resided in the building earlier will give you a sense of ownership of the building for a long time.\r\n\r\nVarious sources are used by the residents for gathering information related to the house. The most common way is to have a conversation with other persons who have lived in the locality for a long time, thus gather clear and correct opinions about the history of the building . Another way is to surf  the internet to find news that had been reported about the villa, although the information might not be perfect, most of the details will be correct.

        "essay": "Nowadays, the young should volunteer to help people in the community. Despite some drawbacks of this decision. I think that the benefits are more significant.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are a number of major disadvantages of working in the community without salary. One evident strength is that it would make the young discouraged. In other words, when they work in the society without salary, they will feel discouraged and they also do not have the effort to continue working. Another reason is that they will not focus on their studies. The young who are too focused on their work, they will not concentrate on their studies at university. This leads to they can not being able to graduate because of bad academic result.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I argue that there are some obvious advantages that would make it better not to volunteer to help people in the community. Firstly, this allows the young to see the various aspects of life when they realize that many people around them do not have the basic necessities of life, they will learn to count their blessings. These activities help them gain insight into the lives of the poor, realize how fortunate they are. Consequently, they will have a higher sense of responsibility with the community. Secondly, volunteering is a great opportunity to acquire valuable work experience. They can mention these stents in their resume when it is time to apply for a job. In addition, the young who have done some kind of community work are more likely to get hired than someone who has absolutely no experience of volunteering.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the young might find it difficult to work in the community without being unpaid.

From my perspective, people are connecting together because of mechanical advancements.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, several types of devices are a  boon to the rich who is making progress in society. This is because innovation in mechinery has given the rich people a different types of ideas through which they can proliferate their businesses. It is only possible by investing in manufacturing processes. For example, in the USA, citizens have developed industries of technology bases such as electronic equipment, machines, and household devices. As a result, this type of business is growing more and more, while investment in  this sector has become impossible for the poor people. Consequently, a huge barricade erects between the developed countries and poor nations.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, people, from all walks of life, are , now an integral part of the modern era where technology and its uses booming in every nook and corner.

Selling at higher price and feeding the curiosity of human nature are some of the reasons which lead them to search through the internet and ask elderly neighbours.\r\n\r\nThere are some reasons that attracted people to know the history of a house. Firstly, and maybe the most important, is the value of a building could be affected by its past, like an antique object. There are people who would spend more if a dwelling has belonged to a popular person. Prof Hesabi’s house, for example, is valued much more compared to a regular similar one, it turned to a museum though. Secondly, human nature is full of curiosity which is a cause of progress by leading him/her to investigate almost everything ,especially if owns it.

        "essay": "It is believed that parents should be disciplined owing to their wrongdoing as their children to be paradigms for their offspring. The following paragraphs will analyze different aspects of this matter before providing the perspective that I advocate for. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, advocates of the mentioned opinion have their rational grounds. To begin with, it is necessary that the predecessors such as parents ought to take accountability for their malpractices which could give several adverse impacts on the development of thoughts of children. To elaborate, according to numerous illustrious policies relating to juveniles such as children’s upbringing policy, parents have liability for educating their offspring. In fact,  the bulk of adolescents has long been greatly influenced by their parents, so children could emulate some misbehaviour of their parents. To show an example, if children regularly expose themselves to their parents who repeatedly smoke or drink, they could mimic their parents and become chain smokers. Thus, not only have the responsibility for bringing up their offspring, but parents also play a vital part in being a model for their children to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the above arguments are insufficient to come to the conclusion that parents need to be punished due to their faults. At the simplest, there are myriad factors that contribute to the delinquency of juveniles. In particular, regarding time, the exposure time to peer  children is superior to the period of exposure to parents. Truly, children spend almost all their time studying and locating at school, so it is feasible that children could be affected negatively by their friends who are toxic. Thus, due to said toxic ones, children could be provoked to violate ethics by an ample of poor manners being latent on the children. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is indisputable that children are greatly affected by their parents, but I am still aware that parents are not the sole factors that contribute to the character of children, so said discipline is unnecessary.",

        "essay": "Though education for young people is a must, there is an argument that government funds should be more focused on the education of aged ones with a lack of basic literacy. I strongly agree with this statement because the illiterate adult population is lagging far behind  the rest, and this scenario is impacting  their individual well-being which has a knock-on effect on the overall economy. I am going to elucidate the idea in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nPeople who cannot read and write encounter many difficulties in their lives. For employment opportunities, they can only do simple low-paid jobs and are unlikely to work for a business due to the lack of basic skills and certificates. Most companies today require candidates, even  blue workers, to have at least a high school degree. As a result, they will not receive any insurance in case of sickness or pension when resigning. They would belong to the disadvantaged group who easily become jobless at any time, especially during an economic crisis. In their daily lives, the inability to read and write leads to their shortage of knowledge and information about the world. Illiterate people cannot stay updated with the current affairs around them. When bad weather events such as storms occur, they are slow to respond and may lose all assets. When there is a new scam, they are the most vulnerable group. When they are a victim of crimes such as physical abuse, they are most likely to endure the pain by themselves since they do not know where to seek  help.\r\n\r\nThe increased literacy in the adult population can contribute positively to the economy of a country.  Literacy skills enable people to learn new skills and knowledge, and thus improve their career prospects. A better educated workforce will also be more productive and generate more value, which would enhance the country’s economic strength. Children and young people who have parents with higher levels of literacy usually receive a better education in the family and develop skills needed for the next-generation workforce. Furthermore, it is widely known that a lower unemployment rate can lessen strains on the social security system. That is how literacy level impacts  economic growth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should divert more funds to adult literacy because it can help them to secure their rights and make an impact on future generations. In fact, an educated age group has a trickle-down effect on the economy as a whole.",

I disagree with this statement because holidays help students to refresh and they help people to pass the time with their dear ones. \r\n\r\nInitially, people relax when they are on  holiday and this leads to starting studying more energetically. During a given period scholars can do numerous leisure date activities which are probably hard to do normally. If a brain deals with something enjoyable, it generates dopamine which makes humans cheerful and dynamic. Thus, when scholars come back to their schools and universities, teachers, and lecturers find them more concentrated and eager to learn. For example, most developed countries try to lessen the months of a school year, because an exhausted person can hardly learn anything new. \r\n\r\nSecondly,  everyone should save several hours for family and friends. This is a quite vital part of life that all need. Moreover, spending, for example, a few days with them strengthens family bonds. Family members, for instance; can have a meal together while talking about funny things or travel for a few days with a discussion of some problematic things in a positive way. If a student has some problems can share and get advice. As a result, this person will begin the next period of education with less negativeness and stress. \r\n\r\nAll in all, there are two distinct opinions about whether taking holidays is advantageous or not. I support the idea that they are essential. The reasons why I ponder like that are vacations make students lively and give them an opportunity to communicate with loved ones freely.",

Some people claim that the primary merit of international cooperation in environmental protection, while others suppose that the main strength of such collaboration is stimulating global trade. Before presenting my perspective, this essay will examine both views.\r\n\r\n       Admittedly, it is reasonable for some to argue that environmental protection needs global efforts. If governments from all over the world endeavor together to enact stricter laws and regulations on the discharge of pollutants and gas emissions, the space of global warming will slow down effectively. Furthermore, the multinational collaboration will be a wide-open door for many environmental organizations and scientists to exchange viable solutions and advanced technologies that could be tackle environmental issues. For example, they can discuss methods to exploit renewable energy resources to replace fossil energy sources, which may be a practical solution to minimize environmental pollution.\r\n\r\n      When it comes to global business, cross-border cooperation plays an indispensable role in the international market boom. First and foremost, many enterprises will have a chance to conquer new markets and territories and reach more consumers, thus increasing sales and achieving the goal of maximizing business profit. In addition, global trade facilitates developing countries to approach modern techniques and professional skills, which can foster their economic development. Furthermore, international trade activities may create more employment opportunities and lessen the shortage of labor. Without economic collaboration, many countries can be challenging to address these hurdles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n      In conclusion, multinational collaboration is a required element to protect the environment and impulse the development of global trade.

While there are a variety of beneficial reasons to enter the job market, I would argue that it is better to go to university.\r\n \r\nIn terms of getting a work straight from after school, many adolescents prefer starting to earn money as soon as possible rather than continuing their education. It would mean that they want to afford their own house or start a family and also they can make themselves become more independent. Moreover, in their careers, they can gain real experience and learn practical skills that can help increase their professionalism and lead to promotion easily. Because of some cases, employers are more concerned about employees' abilities rather than their academic backgrounds.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, tertiary education is seen as the ticket to entering certain unique aspects. For example, it is impossible to become a lawyer or a doctor without academic qualification. Furthermore, those specific fields are more competitive than ever. Sometimes there might be hundreds of applicants bidding for one position. If you do not have a qualification you cannot compete. And while, university or college also offers diverse methods of training their students, let them have a enough knowledge background or critical thinking to face the challenge in the workplace to acquisition higher salaries or access better job opportunities.\r\n \r\nIn conclusion, based on those reasons mentioned above, I believe that students could win a better career if the higher education level they had the more options they can choose.",

        "essay": "Many people consider that it is important for children to learn art at school, however, there are others who opine that it is totally a wastage of student's study time. In my opinion, art is certainly as important as any other subjects because it helps younger children in learning history and in expressing themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, art is considered a useful skill as it allows children to learn about the history and cultural heritage of their nation. It is a well-known fact that the children better learn through images than text, therefore teachers use various art pieces to explain them many historical events. According to a survey, it was found that children who learned the story through snapshots were able to retain that information for longer duration as compared to others. Additionally, children learn to express themselves via creativity. Art helps children in communicating many concepts which they otherwise find difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many people believe that art is not an important subject to be taught at school because it does not add any value to their profile as other subjects such as math and science does. Simple mathematics calculations are always used in later stages of life, so it is important to learn the math at school level, but this is not the case with Art. Moreover, art does not help children in finding a job when they reach adulthood. This skill is not given much weightage by any employer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, art may not help children in getting a good job or may not be used in practical life when they reach adulthood, but in childhood it helps children immensely by encouraging them to learn about their culture.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through another media platform. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "essay": "There are opinions that the press is the most efficient way to get  info, while others argue that other media platforms are more advantageous. This essay will discuss both sides and draw my conclusion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is undeniable that newspapers are very common in human’s daily life. This is because the press has emerged for a long time and reading newspapers has become a daily habit of the public, especially  seniors. Moreover, newspapers have a wide range of information such as topics related to politics, news about daily life or advertisements. In other words, with only one piece of newspaper, people can obtain reports about every event which is happening around them. Furthermore, reading newspapers is the choice of many people  because of their reliability. Basically, the press operates under a certain code of conduct which regulates the quality and trustworthiness of facts. Therefore, it is required that all news must be checked carefully and verified before publishing. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with the development of new technology and the booming of the internet, there is an increase in the popularity of other media platforms for instance online press or Facebook. The main reason for this trend is that these new platforms play a role as  info storage and can quickly and easily deliver any type of news to readers with just a few simple clicks. For example, with an internet connection and using smartphones, Vietnamese people not only can get exact information about the election of the American President but also can watch the whole election process broadcasted lively.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although both newspapers and other media platforms are crucial in human daily life, I believe that the new platforms will take over the traditional press soon due to their availability of information and accessibility.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, a large number of people tend to buy items such as clothes, cars and other things from reputable companies. The reasons will be discussed in this essay and in my opinion, this trend both has advantages and drawbacks in equal measure.\r\n\r\nThere are several causes of why more and more people prefer owning luxurious products. Firstly, due to the beliefs on personal possession reflecting wealth, personal status and appearance, many people use clothes, accessories from a popular brand. For example, many consumers buy shoes from Nike or Adidas because it helps them to enhance their appearance. Another reasons are that exorbitant-priced products of famous brands are made of expensive materials and unique feature, so they are always high-qualified, highly durable. Using these goods would bring more comfort to the users and also save more money in the long period than massive products.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the increasing number of people buying good items from large enterprises can bring both benefits and disadvantages to the business world. Countries, where famous brand are based on, are more likely to have strong an healthy economy. The US - the home of many famous brands such as Apple or Microsoft, for instance, has been the most powerful economic since the late 20th century when the products of these organizations are not only popular in domestic but also favored in foreign nations. However, the rise in the number of large brand names can lead to the monopoly as they will attempt to dominate and wipe out small rivals to maintain their positions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the tendency of consuming goods from famous brands comes from people’s perception of personal belongings showing their fortune and the high qualification for those expensive products. This trend has a positive and negative effect on the business market",

        "essay": "Nowadays, a great deal of attention has been paid to community operation. Some people opine that it is important to involve teenagers to the local community  and give them an unpaid work. I strongly agree with this because this benefits both youngsters and society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are two merits for the younger generations. Firstly, they are able to get work experience. There are important things that youngsters need to know other than school subjects. For instance, communication skill is vital at a workplace. Volunteer works in the community provide teenagers opportunities to learn how to communicate with seniors in life. In addition, this enhances school studies at the same time. Since youngsters engage works in  society, this help to understand social structures.\r\n\r\nOn top of that,  society also receives merits. At first, teenagers can animate  society. For instance, they often clean up a town and plant trees and flowers in Japan. This makes the atmosphere of  society better and brighter. In addition to this, adults are able to widen their perspectives thanks to the younger generation. In general, the younger generation has the flexible way of thinking, and they catch information faster than adults. Giving seniors an opportunity to get in touch with teenagers, they can learn new things and refresh their way of thinking.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I reiterate my complete agreement with this topic for two reasons. This is because teenagers are able to learn important skills such as communication and social structures, and enhance school learnings, and the society is animated by them.",

The majority of people believe that museums should be visited as an entertainment while others think that this place is to educate. In my opinion, I see museums as a place where people can do both fun and get knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, not everyone in this world enjoy visiting a monument because most of the people are not really interested in history or geography. Furthermore, they will be bored if there is no something funny to see. For instance, research reveals that more than 30% of teenagers that went to museums felt no enjoyable. Some of them even wanted to go home earlier. As a result, a function of museums should be added more to be entertain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, generally, museums are related to history, and some of them contain many ancient artefacts and weapons. This purpose is to give public new knowledge about our past conditions or how our heroes sacrificed themselves. For example, in Yogyakarta, there is a house that constructed into a museum that show Indonesian history. Because of this, tourists and visitors can see real-life example of a country history, and they can get education that they can not get in schools.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although a function of museums is to educate people, it is not wrong to turn museums into entertainment places.",

However , in order to arrive quickly and comfortably ,people tend to drive their own cars ,even though if they have to drive long distances . As a result of that , many issues are considered like, traffic congestion and pollution of environment.

Do the benefits outweigh the minus.\r\nThis essay illustrate that, the pros include speed and benefit, and the cons are the deprivation of live communication\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the biggest benefit of social media is that it has shortened distances from hours to seconds. When there was no online environment people relied on phone calls or emails to communicate, and they frequently had to wait months or even years to see family members who were living away from home. However, with the introduction of various options like Facebook and Twitter, this has decreased the amount of time it takes to connect.

The majority of children today only have online friendships, which makes it difficult for them to communicate in real time or express their emotions. Also on the Internet  teenagers feel their impunity and permissiveness because of this.

Some people believe that increasing the price of fuel for vehicles can decrease the impact on the natural surroundings in the future. Even though there are people who are declined, in this paper, I will partially agree with this solution.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the price of oil for vehicles can cause harm for society. Especially the impact on the economy. For instance, the cost of commodities and transportation will be as costly as the cost of fuel. The public would have difficulty fulfilling their basic needs and maybe increase the percentage of poverty in the country. However, this phenomenon might be impactful for the middle down society instead of the wealthy community. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with regards to the price of oil increasing, users of thefuel energy will decrease. Nevertheless, scientists will then invent alternative energy to replace theoil. For instance, biogas energy which is made from organic waste and a fuel made from plants or vegetable materials. Those fuels are environmentally friendly and can be accepted by society. In addition, inventors will be finding energy efficient vehicles in the future. And Tesla is a good example of this, namely Elon Musk designing an electric car charged by energy from electricity or a solar panel.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this decision will be better for the environment as well as human beings and I wholeheartedly support this argument, even though some people will feel the enormous impact in the first phase.

        "essay": "It is often argued that a country should invest more money in vocational training rather than tertiary education due to changes in the labour market. I strongly oppose this idea and will give my reasons below.\r\n\r\nPractical skills training has been widely embraced , especially by today's youngsters, since it offers financial benefits. While university students are more likely to be put under a lot of strain due to student debts and overwhelming schoolwork during 4 years, those taking up a vocational course are in relief as training schools are cheap, fast and ease them into employment immediately after course completion. Moreover, people have the option of flexibility when it comes to attending a vocational course which is a great study pathway for those whose schedule is inconsistent. For example, Upskilled, a registered vocational training, offers online courses for busy people who have a hectic schedule. Due to financial advantages and time flexibility, vocational education suits best people who are time-poor or not financially sustainable.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, lacking a university degree does limit one's options, especially in a job market where a university degree is a minimum requirement. An individual who has a bachelor's degree can have more opportunities to earn a decent salary and get promotions at work.For example, The ministers for the Department of Education sent out  a media release highlighting the fact that 90% of university graduates hold managerial and professional roles  while earning a median salary. This demonstrates, I believe, that undergraduates might initially have lower wages but they are more likely to get a higher ceiling on future earnings\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although vocational education sounds appealing, it potentially restricts oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs whereas higher education has the great perk of being able to accelerate one's career ladder.",

In this essay, I shall examine both sides before offering my own thoughts in the subject.\r\nTo begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. The first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. These websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. For instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.\r\nAs for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. In fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.\r\nIn conclusion, every person has to choose his own preferable type of shopping because evryone has different opinions.

Increasing the payment of fuel is also considered as an effective measure to solve global environmental problems. A majority of people support this method as compared to people who oppose it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, natural resources available for food are exhausting at a very fast pace and it is believed that  if the fuel charge is increased, humans can slow down the consumption to some extent. For instance, a recent survey done in U.S shows that if a commodity price is doubled then the demand is reduced to 40 per cent in total. It clearly shows that if there will be a rise in electricity value then humans will try to spend less on fuels like petroleum, diesel or LPG. Public transport will be more used as a result and it will definitely be more eco friendly.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a hike in ammunition price will result in less traffic and pollution resulting in efficient transportation and contributing to a better environment. Our future generation will be able to breathe in a greener environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, few people still think that if the electricity rate is increased it will be a burden to a part of society which is below poverty line. Not everyone will be able to afford the expensive cost of gas. for example, poor people still use kerosene as an oil to cook their meals and they can not bear the increased worth. The government will need to think over needy people requirements before imposing any price hikes for fuel.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, a rise in fuel amount will definitely benefit the global environmental issues.

It is believed that giving harsh penalties to people who commit these offences, is the only way to improve safety. I partially agree with it as proper guidance and training can also help to increase road safety.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there should be stricter punishments for driving offences like drunk driving, speeding and not following the transport rules. As discipline is the key to running traffic smoothly on roads. If there would no penalties or fines, drivers would take rules and regulations on roads for granted.For example, in Canada, there are fine imposed for not following travel rules as well as there is a demerit of points if someone commits a serious driving offence. Therefore, all these fines and penalties help the authorities to control transportation  and safety on roads.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people should be able to get proper guidance and training in their learning processes.They should be aware of safe driving skills. For this, drivers should provide with classes, which explain to them how important is to drive safely and follow the transport rules. For instance, in some countries, in  extremely high-traffic areas,drivers are provided with extra classes for safe driving which helps them to enhance their driving skills. Thus, information regarding rules and regulations and proper training can also help to drive safely. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I would say , although  stricter punishment is necessary for road safety, proper training and guidance can also play a key role to achieve this.",

Universities should offer only relevant courses that have the potential to cater to the market’s requirement.\r\n\r\nHiring has been enormous for computers and electronics engineering graduates in the last three decades due to technological advancements in those areas. on the other hand, It is low for other engineering disciplines but the number of students passing out each year is uniform across all the groups. For instance, Computers, electronics, mechanical, and civil engineering groups had the same number of seats in my college. The excess supply and lesser demand resulted in inadequate opportunities for those belonging to these fields.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is the considerable variance in remuneration across these functions. For example, Global companies hire computer sciences and electronic graduates. They receive high salaries due to different benchmarks adopted by multinational companies. In contrast, local firms employ mechanical and civil engineering graduates paying relatively lower wages.\r\n\r\nUniversities should review the quota of seats based on the market conditions and change them from time to time in consultation with industry leaders and the Government. They should also modify the course contents periodically to make them relevant to future needs.

In consequence, both manufacturing companies and people must be accountable for environmental protection.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal factors that inflict environmental dilemmas. One of those is industrialisation, in fact, many wastes including oil and chemicals from factories and warehouses are being thrown into the environment. They contaminate the water which causes water pollution and makes lots of aquatic animals lose their habitats. Moreover, the waste is also being thrown into landfills, ruining the fertility of the soil which decreases the productivity of crops and other vegetables.

Furthermore, if people infringe the law, then heavy fines and punishments will be put into practice. In terms of large corporations and individuals, improving self-awareness is the most important thing.

The mentioned issue is becoming worse day by day due to lack of human's awareness, this could be caused by irresponsibility  or even the government's ignorance. As a result, there are some increasing amounts of plastic and waste dumped into the ocean, causing water pollution and the deaths of tons of living creatures under the sea. For example, before those pollution issues gain people's attention, there were tons of plastic and nylon littered on a beach by an enormous number of visitors. After some local and volunteering's effective activities have started at the beach like picking up trash, helping some turtles to be free from the plastic bag sticking around theirs heads, the scenery has become fresher and more healthy sea creatures have been born there.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are adverse thoughts that the only solution to climate change is getting used to it.

From my perspective, this tendency has raised many disrupting concerns relating to the issues of manipulating the public opinion and fostering overshopping.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the popularity of advertisements can form a negative perspective in daily activities. It is true that the high density of advertisements leads to memorable footage stucking in the audience's minds.

For example, people watching car advertisements usually recognize that the background of these tend to decorate in the luxury way leading to a mindset that only the high-order classes can buy them. Because the target audiences of car sellers are often the high income people, however it could be seen that advertisements release in the public eye. Thus, it is understandable that many people hold a belief that owning a car is a represented aspect belonging to the rich community. Nevertheless, it is noticeable that this is a mistrustful idea and stereotype, which many forms of advertisements are manipulating the public to push their sales.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the high density has not only shifted people’s perspective, but also led to detrimental activities. Firstly, many advertisements promoting their items tend to constantly repeat not only on TV and smartphones, but also on billboards whether people going out, this would stick in customers’ memories and lead to a feeling of curiosity or fear of missing out. Therefore, trending products are usually hunted and attracted by a plethora of consumers. However, there are a variety of top trending products from several aspects in the market, leading to the customers’ tendency of splashing all their money on. It reckons that this is an expenditure habit and also harms the surrounding environment due to the high demands of producing too many items. Zara, a fashion brand, for example, is a well-known case for fast fashion. This company is usually boycotted because in every new season, it would like to release a new collection and overproduct. Therefore, the consumption is always lower than the production and the leftovers actually contribute to the global garbage dump more seriously.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is true that many advertisements around daily lives have many highlighted negative impacts, including distorting the audiences’ view or breeding overconsumption.",

        "essay": "There is no doubt these days, news is one of the most important parts in our modern life. However the question is, are we wasting our time when read the newspaper or follow it in television? In this essay I am going to argue that.\r\n\r\nThere are many people believe that, news is connecting to their lives. Firstly, follow news programmes is important to know what is going on the world and to be knowing what happens around them. In fact, they could be attention if there is any crisis appear in the world such as, nowadays the COVID 19 has spared in the whole world. Moreover, business men require to be attention about the economic news also political disaster, because policy has relation with economy, if any political disaster happens to the world, it will affect strongly in the international economy, so business men will run to buy anything that its price was affect.

        "essay": "The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.",

While others and I disagree with the idea and think that there are more crucial threats. In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one of the major reasons that folk say that research nowadays should focus on handling world health problems is that they would like to have a longer life. In other words, these days, the average length of human life is seventy years old. As a result, if medicines and medical treatments are enhanced, people will have an extended lifetime. Moreover, currently, there are numerous new illnesses emerging all the time. To illustrate, the Covid-19 is a hazardous disease that people around the world have not known before and have to invent vaccines to deal with it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the obvious reason that individuals think that there are more vital issues is that environmental problems are tremendously significant. In simple terms, If the environment is poor, it will affect our lives severely. For instance, the fumes emitted from cars can cause lung diseases. On top of that, political issues also play an important role in our lives. That is to say, If governments provide ample good welfares to their citizens, individuals will have better quality lives.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there are many reasons why folk think that scientific research presently should focus on solving health threats, I strongly disagree with this notion and believe that there are more significant issues.",

I totally disagree with this idea; there are two reasons to support my idea.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the history of the earth has already proved that the climate changing could destroy a civilization. For instance, dinosaur became extinct in the ancient time because of they did not have any methods to predict the global disaster which is caused by climate changing. According the research, global warming could led to a sort of negative consequences, such as rising sea level and broken biological chain. Thus, we should never ignore that how our environment is important.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration in this case is that human being is the main responsibility taker of the global warming compare with other lives in this world.

As result, it led the serious carbon dioxide emission happened, and amount of animals lost their habitats even some species are facing the threat of extinct.

        "essay": "There is a common belief that nowadays  teenagers have to face up to the accepted and validated by their friends or peers.In my perspective, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand,a notable upside is that peer pressure may motivate young people into discovering new interests that they may not have considered otherwise.This means,if they have pressure by their fellow millennials they will try their best day by day.To illustrate, after seeing photos of their peers at the gym, an adolescent might feel encouraged to take part in similar physical exercises, which is helpful for their physical health in turn.Besides young people usually take others, especially with whom they have close intimacy, as role models. Therefore, if peers can set a good example for their counterparts, they will probably achieve improvement in both academic and social aspects.When teenagers look at their friends get successful they will have an effort to keep up with them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,the negative should not be overshadowed by the positive. It is worth mentioning that the stress originating from a comparison among children would make them feel inferior to others, which leads to the fear of expressing themselves as well as potential self-distancing from family and friends.

Personally, I agree with the view that people exhibit greater dependence than ever before.\r\n\r\nIt is true that nowadays people tend to stay away from their hometown and seek a satisfying position, which makes people consider independence to become more popular in current society. For example, a young man who cannot get a job with an adequate salary for living always goes to the big city and find  high-profit jobs. In this case, residents are more independent of their relatives who live in their hometown. Meanwhile, the high-stressed lifestyle occupies adults' free time, exhausting them and further decreasing their contact with family, friends and cooperators.  \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I hold the viewpoint that adults actually require more consideration and attention from people around them compared with the past. We have to recognize that people are eager to be concerned, which stems from basic human nature, and stay in various groups. For instance, the relationship between people in the past is simple since they always live in the rural and only keep connections with fewer people who live close to them. However, adults in the city are required to play different roles in different groups. When people want to change their social relationships, they will find it difficult due to heavy dependence.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I totally approve that people become more dependent on the communities and groups they stay in.",

I partly agree with this notion and show some underlying ideas why they are reasonable.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary reasons why large towns have to be displayed different tourist attractions. First and foremost, these public places benefit the tourism industry in a particular town. A wide range of outdoor sites enhances both international and local people passing by and broadcasting to the world. For example, Ben Thanh Market is a well-known place that tourists will have to visit a once-in-a-lifetime if they are going to Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Sai Gon. In addition, a park is an ideal place where people are able to do exercise or go jogging in the cool weather. With a lot of greenery, beautiful landscapes surrounded the place, which gives people a positive energy to motivate them to keep healthy.\r\n\r\nApart from the practical benefits expressed above, I believe that there are some potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nFirstly, if there are too many huge outdoor places constructed in the cities, there is not enough space for pedestrians in the crowded towns. People may be caught in vehicle accidents because they have to walk on the main street. Secondly, the expenses for refurbishing large buildings are extremely high. Although local authorities surely do not neglect the environmental aspect and vandalization, it is unavoidable. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite there are some disadvantages that have the capacity of addressing the tackle someday, developing the tourism side for the finance of cities and providing a chilling environment for people can be considerable.",

Thus, \r\n\r\nI will express the reason that  fromresult this phenomenon and the methods that how public do research about it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, people have the natural desire or attempt to know the histories about the house that they living in. They want to know the old stories of the building  to see whether it holds value. Secondly, in addition, when people purchase a house, the traditional culture of the building and the owner’s capacity could make a huge value on it and could be a good investment.For instance, Hu Tong is a Chinese traditional architecture that is very expensive. When people attempt to purchase the Hu Tong building, they always want to know the history of this house and the property owner’s story. Sometimes, the story on the building could have a big return on investment. \r\n\r\nRegarding  the methods of research the information of a house, there are amount of ways that on doing it nowadays.

        "essay": "A lot of individuals nowadays are required to work shifts. Such people are exposed to a variety of problems such as high levels of stress and criminals who might come during the night shift. A few steps can be taken to solve these issues.\r\nShift workers are faced by different problems regardless of their jobs. Firstly, the exhaustion that they face during their working hours is undeniable. Due to not having regular working hours, their bodies cannot adapt to a specific working pattern since they might work in the evenings or at night. As a result, they suffer from the lack of sleep and feel sluggish in the morning and cannot focus on any tasks. Secondly, people who work during the night shift are exposed to the serious problem of facing dangerous people. For instance, a cashier who works at night might face dangerous criminals, thieves, or people who consumed large amounts of alcohol or drugs.\r\nThere are some steps that can mitigate or even eliminate the drawbacks of working shifts. Shift workers must take care of themselves during the time they are not working. In other words, they must get at least seven hours of sleep, eat three healthy meals, and take vitamins. This can help their bodies get stronger and avoid malnutrition and fatigue. Furthermore, they should be checked by their doctors regularly since they are likely to develop anxiety and high blood pressure due to high levels of stress. Another point is that supermarkets that are open during the night must install cameras inside and outside the store to threaten criminals. \r\nIn conclusion, although shift workers face some problems, they can be reduced if cameras were installed in supermarkets and if employees took care of themselves and maintained their health.",

        "essay": "It is widely thought that people living in overdeveloped countries cannot be more content with any further economic advancement. From my perspective, I totally agree with this statement for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge a fact that the advancement in national prosperity is directly proportional to the expenses of commodities. Undeniably, the more thriving the citizens of a country are, the more extravagant the products and services become, and the harder the lives of the needy could be. Hence, the enrichment of a state is not always synonymous with the guarantee of betterment in living standards. An example of this justification is India, where a significant number of residents live in poor conditions due to the difficulties in accessing products and services which are essential to their well-being.\r\n\r\nAnother point that needs to be taken into consideration is that economic success is not the sole constituent of satisfaction. In fact, several countries in the world have focused on their people’s mental wholesomeness, which can partially be obtained by granting them opportunities to enjoy lives via social welfare and other benefits, as a new priority since that is an indispensable aspect of life apart from monetary richness. Therefore, not only do they become materially satisfied but also mentally fulfilled. For instance, Canada has an effective welfare system that enables its citizens to work for a fixed and reasonable amount of time weekly so that they will have more time to spend with families and friends without overthinking about work and personal financial issues.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a mere additional increase in economic wealth in developed countries hardly satisfies their citizens any further for the aforementioned reasons.",

        "essay": "These days, the number of elders has progressively increased in many countries across the world. It becomes debatable whether sons and daughters should take responsibility for looking after their parents when they get older and cannot take care of themselves, or not. In this essay, the reasons to support my agreement with the statement will be elaborated on before my conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, parents are the person who devotes themselves to raising us since we were a baby  and advocates financial support for education, living, and many more with their endless love. Without them, all of us will never born on the earth. To illustrate, my mother  raised me since I was unable to do anything such as taking a bath, cooking a meal, changing a cloth, or even eating, and standing. Now, I'm 26 years old and mature enough to have a constant job that can generate income. Therefore, it is basically responsible to repay by taking care of them when their physical and mental health as well as financial statement become escalated and do not have the ability to look after themselves.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, taking care of our parents by doing is the best lesson for teaching our children to look after us when we get old. Kids will learn and duplicate our behaviour. If we treat our parents very well, in the future kids will be likely to do the same. For example, without any words  teaching me about repaying, my father taught me by action as he well took care of my grandparents every day. Eventually, I absorb and imitate his behaviour automatically, and I do the same thing that my father did to my grandparent.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this essay discussed the two major reasons why we have to look after our elder family members including repaying them for taking care of us since we were young, and being the best reason for the next generation.

No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.\r\nMusic can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.\r\nOn the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.\r\nIn summary, based on the above-reviewed examples of how music can be helpful in stress-relief, we can see that there is two possible mechanism, a passive and an active, which can play a role in this phenomenon.",

From my perspective, I am not in favour of this opinion, believing that both individuals and governments should work collaboratively to reverse the trend, thus lowering the risks and repercussions brought by climate change.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, humans are unable to make a compromise with climate change, so that we can live with it in a proper manner. For one thing, there is not much leeway for us if we do not stop some human activities that are harmful to the Earth. For example, greenhouse gas emission results in global temperature rise, which makes the sea level increase to a certain degree, thereby immersing many cities and towns on the land. As a result, millions of people will become homeless, and it may trigger a shortage of food supply, therefore threatening the survival of humans. For another, under no circumstance cannot we find a way to live with the phenomenon, because it puts all of us in the danger of homelessness and poverty. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, actions should be taken to preserve the world as much as we can, in case it is too late to save us from climatic deterioration. To begin with, individuals ought to make an effort to go green, which in turn can limit our contribution to the trend. For instance, we need to shift from self-driving to taking public transit, in order to consume less energy. Furthermore, manufacturing is one of the main culprits contributing to climate change, and the government needs to place higher taxes on them, in an effort to drive them to use more renewable energies and produce effectively. Consequently, those actions will exert a positive influence on the exacerbation of climatic change.   \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that we must address the problems caused by climate change instead of coexisting with them.",

The main one is the opportunity for one to explore various occupations before initiating their studies in order to find out what truly interests them and what do not. This reduces the chances of disappointment in the future when beginning their careers. Furthermore, these professionals tend to be more qualified and successful because of the interest they have in their field of study.\r\n\r\nAnother immense positive outcome of a gap year is personal growth.

This is probably the most enriching experience in life since it teaches them to respect and admire the diversity in the world, which is a game-changer nowadays.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are also drawbacks.

Many believe that this phenomenon has upset people in many events. Other people believe this has more positive vibes and constructively engaging. In my opinion, sometimes ads help us to decide a thing in a short time but rather be annoyed many times.\r\n\r\nFirstly, many online advertisements sometimes place their boxes in scattered ways on the screen. In my past experience, I often accidentally clicked the ads even if not with my intention because their ad boxes were everywhere on my screen. I were not happy with this action because this slowed my browsing experiments, especially when I were in a hurry. After seconds, I felt really annoyed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if we talk about online advertisements, the programmers have already set how the advertisements work in a unique way. Google, for instance, its machine learning will know what you are confused about to choosing a red or green dress by saving your historical browser data. Then they will show you advertisements (third-party) for different types of red dresses in the morning and green dresses in the evening. The aim is you will click one of the advertisements shown and they will earn commissions from the third party. Consequently, for this matter, I would say this event is useful and has a positive vibe. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, some ads rarely can not be avoided. The more we surf on the internet, the more they will provide us with third-party ads. But instead of placing those ads in questionable ways, they should improve their layout though. Because screen layout will increase user experience and indeed upscale the value of ads.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?",
        "essay": "In many countries, people are exploring the origin of their living premises. This essay will discuss the causes behind this curiosity and the means of digging into the history of the house or the building they live in. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are many advantages on finding past facts about the living place. For  example, the previous owner of the house could be a celebrity. The current owner can advertise this information and sell the house for a higher price. Moreover, residents can get a full picture of the legal background of the land. For an instance, if the previous owners have created false documents, there will be a risk of being subjected to unpredicted lawsuits. Additionally, planning  repair and maintenance tasks will be quite efficient and easy. The required materials and equipment can be deployed at precise moments. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the most useful way of finding the historical background of a residential area is the internet. As a result of technological advancements, many records are archived in the digital domain. The storage of information on the internet is cost-efficient and time-saving. Through the internet, an information seeker can obtain basic data and facts about a house or building within a short period of time. However, if the private apartment is located in the suburbs, asking the local residents would be the better choice. They have lived there for a long time so their knowledge about the neighbours is impressive. For instance, a man who believed the advertising by newspapers decided to buy a residence in the suburbs. Luckily, he has come directly to the place and the local residents told him a story about the whole family being murdered in that house; therefore, he could dodge the house containing bad luck.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are a lot of benefits to finding the past of a residential place. The usage of multiple research methods will be practical in finding information with more precision and accuracy",

        "essay": "Over the past few decades, a controversial debate has been arising on the issue of Museums,some people say that it is a place for entertainment whereas others strongly say that it is for knowledge sharing.As far as I am concerned,the museums should be a place for  both entertainment and education as well.\r\n\r\nIn the arsenal of arguments supporting some people's perspective  on Museum as a place of gathering knowledge,one of the most potent is its ethnicity is valued and preserved  for this generation as well to the  upcoming generations.One of the key points is that museums   give us a clear picture of how our ancestors lived, the trials and tribulations they had conquered,the values, and morals they  followed throughout their life so on.Si according to them, it's a place where we should consider it  as dignified and respectful.For instance, Padmanabhapuram palace in the district of Trivandrum where the purity has been preserved  .\r\n\r\non the other hand , others value museums as the place of   entertainment where they can get together and spend time for  limitless fun activities.The key points they suggest are that in this process of urbanisation, and busy scheduled lifestyle,places like museums create a platform for the family to get to know each other and spend time on leisure activities.It also gives an income to the government if they make it  a place for entertainment .For instance, the palace of Kowdiyar  is on the edge of providing both entertainment and  education  where  it is being changed as a township on the spot.\r\n\r\nFinally,I always value it for a mixture of both awareness and entertainment.",

        "essay": "There is an increasing number of improper drug users in the modern society, especially the adolescents and teenagers experimenting with various drugs, regardless of the legality of such drugs. This phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. This essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.\r\nThe dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. These drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. However, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. The other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. The improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. The most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.\r\nTo tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards. I expect in the future, more suggestions could arise to solve the problem of drug abuse among young people.",

        "essay": "It is argued that increasing fast-food prices is the most efficient solution to tackle the overweight problem of the world. From my view, I completely agree with this viewpoint, but we still need to have different approaches to make this more effective.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is obvious that raising the cost can bring many benefits to the people. To begin with, this action will make fast food become too expensive for consumers to afford on a daily basis therefore, making them reduce the consumption of this food type. For example, if Mcdonald’s food prices are too high, people may not consume them anymore. Subsequently, it also leads to an increase in people who cook at home due to the fast food are not profitable compared to home-cooked food, which is healthier.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, because overweight’s cause// does not just come only from food so that raising the price is not enough, it should come with other approaches with people’s help. Firstly, there should be campaigns that increase public awareness of disadvantages of fattening food and the benefits of exercising. Secondly, the government should provide policies that encourage the development and research of organic foods. For example, the authorities should reduce taxes that relevant with cultivating this type of food or make a budget for research intends to make a healthier meals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while raising the price of these kinds of food can be important, it is not the only approach.

This essay will discuss factors contributing to this trend about store knowledge in the internet rather than books and why I think it is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons I suggest to store knowledge online brings many benefits. Firstly,people may solve their problem conveniently and immidiately by just searching the internet. It even being a common phrase that \"If you have question, just google it\", the only thing what people need to do, is snap their question on mobile application or laptop then they can find the answer easily.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it made a good method to develope education system in rural area or the third countries.

        "essay": "After graduating, many people look for a job. Sometimes they want to work in their passion while others do not take passion as an important thing but the experience and how it can support their lives. Admittedly, the work may be difficult to follow in the beginning but over  time workers can feel the enjoyment because they get the pattern for their work. Therefore, I completely disagree with that statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, these days getting a passion work is not easy since there are plenty of people looking for the job as well. For example, fresh undergraduate students try to get work as same as their excitement but it takes some time. While waiting for their feedback application, undoubtedly, they need funds as well to buy their pieces of stuff. Moreover, if they ignored their tasks when they were already in the work environment, it would jeopardise them since they would not get any promotion or trust from the company.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is working in different areas sometimes can expand more experiences as well as networking. At first, staff may be hard to start when they have no intention of carrying out the job. For instance, someone who has an undergraduate in design and has passion in that area surprisingly accepts a job in a different area as public relations. In her new field, she has to take more time to learn but as time goes by she finally enjoys it and scales up the experience in that field. In addition, when people accept a job, they are used to knowing  their responsibilities, so it is unacceptable if they do not want to perform just because they do not feel joy in it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working with the same passion might be the dream for everyone whereas these days people have to compete with each other to get the job, as a blue-collar or white-collar. I disagree with the statement because employees have to fulfil their tasks which contribute to the company’s goal despite of like or dislike since they already sign the contract with the company. Yet, to boost  workers motivation I think the top management has to create a regular meeting with their staff to discuss  their performance.",

        "essay": "Many staffs hold the belief that academic qualifications are less essential than social skills in terms of job applications. I would argue that I fully disagree with this motion due to some reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are some jobs that require applicants with a relevant academic degree to fulfil the position especially medical doctor, pharmacist, naval engineer, and many other jobs. These professions have a great responsibility and high complexity. For example, doctors have to make a diagnosis of the patients and then make a medical prescription. This job could not tackle by the ones who do not have  special qualifications and formal degrees in medical doctors. The applicants who do not have medical qualifications would give a wrong diagnosis and prescription to the patient.\r\n\r\nSecondly, academic qualifications would give adventages to solve the jobs. Academic qualifications come with specific knowledge for example applicants from industrial engineering backgrounds would have some knowledge in financial analysis, market analysis, risk analysis, production process design, factory layout design and many other skills. All of these skills could help the applicants to make a good feasibility study report. Some skills might  learn through discussion with other competent and experienced staff, but it would take a long time and undetailed.\r\n\r\nThirdly, social skill is one of the important skill in  working life, but they could overweight the role of academic qualifications. Some jobs could not be solved through negotiation and discussion. For instance, big data analysis needs special knowledge of software operation and a good understanding of  coding in order to transform big data into useful information.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the aforementioned points, it can be reiterated that I fully disagree that academic qualifications are less than social skill for job applicants.",

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.\r\nManufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.\r\nCustomers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.\r\nPersonally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging.",

        "essay": "It is the toughest decision for the parents to choose schools for their children. Many parents choose single gender schools, while others go for mixed gender schools. It is thought my people that studying in single gender schools have disadvantages for students in their later life. However, there are arguments on both sides which will be discussed in further paragraphs before forming a pertinent outlook.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Forbes, when students are segregated by genders, they miss opportunities to work together and to develop  vital social skills. As a result, this creates problems in forming adult relationships as children get older. Furthermore, when girls and boys are taught under separate roofs they wrongly conclude that one gender is better or inferior than the other. What is more, in many countries single gender schools are considered as discrimination or against the law. Last but not the least, when students go to mixed gender schools they are exposed to a wider range of experiences than those who go to single sex classes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are few advantages too of single gender schools. Firstly, having  a classroom with both genders can create distractions. For instance, when girls and boys talk about their crush, they focus less on their studies. So this is not the scenario with the co-educational schools. Secondly, in mixed gender schools all the subjects are a part of the curriculum, but, in fact, boys and girls are good in particular subjects so co-education schools is advantageous as they focus on particular subjects based on the gender.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate,  I believe that there are more disadvantages in comparison with the advantages as single gender schools do not provide a richer experience and it also harms the society.",

        "essay": "The rise in the production of consumer goods affects the natural environment. In my opinion, this phenomenon leads to the extinction of flora and fauna and the growth in the proportion of deforestation.\r\n\r\nFirstly, many companies use national materials such as the skin of some animals to produce something. In other words, one of the requirements for some big corporations to run is animals product. For example, massive beauty product manufacturers use an animal to test their new merchandise which is harmful to the  environment moreover, they use animals’ skin to produce  bags or wallet which increase the rate of extinction. Secondly, the increase in this trend line exacerbates deforestation which is treating the environment. Put differently, many of these products need wood to produce so, this catastrophe encourages companies to destroy the environment.\r\n\r\nTo tackle these problems there are several ways that companies can do to mitigates the impact of activities. On the one hand, they can search for alternative sources instead of using animal materials. For instance, they can use manmade raw materials to produce  consumer goods. On the other hand, to restrict companies from cutting trees, the government must put harsh roles on them. For example, companies that need natural facilities have limitations to using them and if they want to use more from natural sources they must pay high taxes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the growth in the proportion of consumer goods results in the elimination of the natural environment.

This essay will discuss on both views and give the evidence why positive trends outweigh its negative effects. \r\nOn the one hand, the internet has several advantages in the lifestyle of people. Firstly, it aids in conveying the message from one place to another in a convenient practice in all over the globe. For instance, people living in Nepal can talk with their friends or relatives living across the Australia with video conference or voice call with the assist of the internet using different apps like Facebook, instagram, what apps and so on. Secondly, the individual can use the internet for course purposes. If the student wants to do online survey, such as  they can exercise in peer for their project research or resource process if it's not possible to examination face to face. For example, last year we cannot attend college due to any strike on the roads, so my friends and I joined messaged and finished our peer research. It's made us easy to do our activities in that terrible circumstance. Thirdly, the internet can be used for buying products or commodities online so it's making life's  of people easy and comfortable. To exemplify, by using the amazon website  and so on with the connection of internet individuals can buy the things they needed and sometime it offers an especial discount as well. Hence, the internet is developing people activity in an advanced manner. \r\nOn the other hand,  due to the internet people become busy all the time in laptop or computer so there is a dearth of socialise among the people and becoming self centred and selfish to each other. Moreover, in case of students, they  are spending more time on internet which hampering their class and their personal development. To exemplify, for everything they depend on google so they don't use their mind and think in a creative style and also away from peer sports or course. Therefore, there is no doubt internet has  negative trends along with positive effects on the person's improvement. \r\nHowever, in my opinion internet positive  effects can outweigh the negative effects because it is necessary for human activities such as survey, shopping, communication. If used properly, it will obviously helpful in the people and make their improvement easy and comfy. \r\nTo sum up, even though internet has both negative and positive effects on people growing, But I believe it's  pros outweigh its cons and it play a key role in forging the peoples' movement more advances if used properly.",

In this essay, we will discuss both the opinions, and attain a reasonable conclusion. \r\n\r\nFirstly, every good thing starts from the home. For example, from learning to manage things by their own to maintaining the accommodation themselves, everything originates here.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a significant difference in doing things. Especially, if it is for our own, we would perform activities, with absolute scrutiny. Thus, it is clear that, to indulge a good habit, it has to be influenced profoundly.\r\n\r\nSecondly, schools don't play a vital role in teaching their students to manage waste and recycle.

        "essay": "People frequently discuss how education and bad behaviour are linked. Several studies suggest that if someone lacks education, they might be more likely to do incorrect things. This has led people to believe that teaching those in prison can prevent them from committing crimes again after they are released. However, I disagree with this idea. This upcoming article will share my viewpoint prior to reaching a conclusion. \r\n\r\nPrimarily, one main reason for the belief that education can reduce lawlessness is that getting a good education can lead to better job opportunities. Nevertheless, things do not always go as planned. Let us consider John as an example, a fictional person who spent time in prison. He learned a lot while behind bars, even earning a certificate in computer programming. Consequently, when he tried to find a job after his release, people still saw him as someone who caused trouble because of his past. Hence, education alone may not change how people view those who have been in trouble previously, making it hard for them to fit back into regular life. \r\n\r\nMoreover, while education can help with several issues, it cannot solve everything. Research shows that misdemeanour has numerous reasons, like not having an abundance of money, growing up in a difficult family, or struggling with personal problems. For instance, a study from the National Institute of Justice found that numerous people who go back to committing crimes after jail have problems with drugs or their emotions. Thus, only teaching them might not be enough to stop them from going back to felonies. We need to consider the bigger picture and provide help with other things too. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although teaching people behind bars might sound like a good idea, it might not be the only solution. Education can offer opportunities; on the contrary, it cannot promise success for those who have had problems previously.

        "essay": "The advertising industry has undeniably thrived in recent decades, infiltrating many aspects of daily life including preferences. From my perspective, I consider this growth to be completely negative as it leads to a distorted perception of reality and overconsumption among consumers.\r\n\r\nMy foremost concern lies in the tendency of advertisements to cause audiences to falsely perceive the relative importance of major factors in their lives. They generally prioritise material possessions and physical appearance while failing to appreciate the value of other positive qualities. A prime example is advertising campaigns run by cosmetics brands which often praise physical attractiveness as being vital to a healthy relationship, although reliability and sympathy have been long proven by experts to be more influential in fostering personal connections. This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.\r\n\r\nThe consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption. That is why governments should issue more stringent laws to restrain the development of the advertising industry until the aforementioned issues are comprehensively addressed.",

Some people argue that fuel costs should be increased in order to tackle the current situation, whereas others debate it should not happen. I completely disagree with the given topic and this essay will elaborate on my opinion.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, hiking the gasoline rate will affect sectors from industrial to farming. Since  all the different industries are linked to each other it will drastically affect the price of the products and standard of living in one way or another. For example, the recent gasoline price hike in India caused the acceleration of food costs throughout the country followed by great inflation. This clearly indicates how each and every sector are interlinked.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, travel costs between one  destination to another will increase. Numerous countries which are dependent on travel and tourism will be affected badly as people will not be willing to travel due to cost spike. For example, tourism in Tunisia was affected badly due to an increase in airlines cost due to the gulf war which ultimately resulted in a price increase of fuel products. This shows how petroleum products play a major role in different fields of jobs.\r\n\r\nTo sum ,up my conclusion, though it is essential to tackle the environmental problem right, increasing fuel prices is not a good solution.

        "essay": "In recent years, an increasing number of individuals in various nations have developed a keen interest in uncovering the historical narratives embedded within their homes or buildings. This trend can be attributed to several factors, and individuals can explore their dwelling's history through various means. \r\n\r\nOne compelling reason for the surge in interest regarding the history of residences is a heightened appreciation for cultural and architectural heritage. In many societies, there is a growing acknowledgment of the significance of preserving historical structures, as they often serve as tangible links to the past. Residents, therefore, feel a sense of responsibility to understand and safeguard the historical value encapsulated within their homes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the ubiquity of information in the digital age plays a pivotal role in fostering this interest. The accessibility of online databases, archives, and historical records empowers individuals to embark on a journey of self-discovery about their dwellings. Online platforms, such as government archives, historical societies, and public libraries, provide a wealth of information that enables residents to trace the origin, architectural evolution, and past occupants of their homes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the desire for a deeper connection to one's community and roots contributes to the growing interest in house or building history. Understanding the historical context of one's residence fosters a sense of belonging and identity within a community, creating a shared history that binds residents together.\r\n\r\nTo conduct research on the history of their dwellings, individuals can utilize a variety of resources. Local archives, historical societies, and municipal records often contain valuable information about property ownership, construction dates, and architectural modifications. Furthermore, engaging with older members of the community, such as longtime residents or local historians, can provide invaluable oral histories and anecdotes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the increasing curiosity about the history of residences can be attributed to a heightened awareness of cultural heritage, easy access to information, and a desire for community connection.

        "prompt": "Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this?\r\n\r\nWhat can be done to solve this problem?",
        "essay": "Concentrating at school is one of the dispute for some students currently. This essay will suggest that the major problem caused by this issue is using phone and then submit restriction on telephone as the most viable solution.\r\n\r\nThe foremost problem caused by being unfocused at school is ability to use phone anytime. Nowadays almost 95 per cent of pupils have a mobile phone, where could be downloaded distractions as variety of social media. Furthermore, most of the students are addicted to new technology and they try to find as much time as they could to play. As can be expected, it bothers their focus since everything they think is only posting new TikTok. Equally, the atmosphere in the classroom effect whether pupils can concentrate or not. It is obvious that it is hard to pay attention in a dark room without any new equipments. \r\n\r\nOne immediate practical solution is to prohibit kids to bring their mobile phones to school and limiting sitting in social media. Likewise, rooms should be fulfilled with needed tew technologies to encourage students to learn and this issue could be solved by government. For instance, the school for gifted pupils in Pavlodar restricted to bring mobile phones to school, the alternative is that pupils who brought cellphone to school, put them into the box before the lessons, and instead of using them they are being enticed with new technologies. It is a good illustration of solution as pupils are not interested in phones anymore as they are fully focused on subjects in great conditions that was proposed by government.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why students have problems with focusing and one of them is being distracted by phone and having bad conditions in the classroom. Possible solutions are to ban bringing cellphones to school and the local government should invest in appropriate conditions at schools.",

        "essay": "In this epoch, all the users are dealing with the rising multitude of adverts from the opposing organizations. I personally think, to a large extent, they persuade their customers through adverts. However, the authority should be taken some precautions, which spread awareness in the public and strong their belief on the standard of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo begin with, many commercial display different products through well reputed persons because they know that advertisement is the best strategy to increase their sales as well as to aware the people about their products. Furthermore, they illustrate the benefits of their items and shows a various range, which is based on the different prices. For instance, nowadays, an advert is playing on the television, that is related to the importance of a calcium for bones. This has dramatically increased the sales and it creates a huge impact on the public. Therefore, advertisement is the best approach to persuade people.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some schools of thoughts, feel the need of steps, those protect the mankind from the tracks of advertising Industries. They most of the time play with the thinking of a young generation to sell their products and then, the offsprings compel their guardians to buy that thing for them, which is not supposed to be a great strategy. They should also prohibit the Adverts of cigarettes because they affect the humans or they should publish a warning sign vividly on its packet. There is also entail to make a legislation against those groups, whose are selling low quality food and playing with the life of humans. For example, a recent survey, revealed that an advertising agency has shown the nutrient list that a junk food contains, which was not true. As a repercussion, community of that area faces serious circumstances pertaining to their health. So, there is a requirement of standard quality control check in order to avoid this again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, advertisement plays an imperative role to raise the market of any item, which sellers face it many times from different companies, but there should be an enforcement of the law to protect consumers.",

        "essay": "Art is something which can have numerous forms. One such form is known as music. While most people have the opinion that latest songs have adverse effects on the youth, a few believe it affects them in a positive way. In this essay, I will discuss both views and explain my support for the former with examples. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are some artists which try to spread a meaningful message through their albums. The lyrics they use are weighty and can influence the younger generation in a variety of ways. However, more and more teenagers nowadays disregard such songs and mostly prefer other genres. For example, research conducted by BBC revealed that around 60% of the youth today listen to the genres like mumble-rap and hip-hop.  What used to be a tool to spread the message about the hardships of the unprivileged, has now become a mechanism for a modern artist to gain attention by using offensive lyrics. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as compared to the earlier generation, the current one is quickly influenced by the graphics that some artists use for their music. These videos are mostly obscene and sway people towards the wrong direction. As they are easily influenced, for some this becomes a way to earn quick money. For instance, many social media pay such singers enormous amounts if their videos generate enough views and engagement. As a result, many people avoid doing traditional jobs and prefer earning money through such activities. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although music has the ability to have a positive impact on teenagers, I believe, the one which is produced currently has harmful lyrics and graphics and can affect youngsters adversely.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, pupils are acquiring a knowledge in the single-sex schools which were selected by their parents, and it is claimed that it will has drawbacks in their future life. I partially agree with this notion. In the following paragraphs I shall put forth my argument to support my point of view.\r\n          Firstly, due to less communication with the opposite gender anyone will sense a discomfort and also one’s professional life affected badly. In other words, pupils, who went to only single-gender schools grew up shy and weak. For instance, personality who wants to get a job should pass a conversation in which checks ability to capable of performing under cruel circumstances. Hence, if this is a graduate of the single-sex school, the individual does not  have a challenging work. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institute have proven to perform excellently under any critical situation.\r\n          On the other hand, co-educational institutions have a badly discipline issue, which interfere of their studies with allowing various  contradictions. However, separated gender schools can avoid from these problems and as a result, everyone would completely focus on their lessons. To put it simply, it is proved that almost all of the graduates who gain an education in single-sex high schools have more ability to concentrate comparing with conventional institutes. Therefore, this type of schools does not waste special time and improves attention skills.\r\n          To sum up, I believe that young generations who were not attending co-ed schools are not able to successfully and develop professionally.",

        "essay": "In this day and age, along with the rapid development of modern society, a wide range of problems related to the environment is inevitable. From my personal perspective, an international organization and local government should join hands to handle the green issues and distribute the responsibility equally.\r\nOn the one hand, I am of the opinion that addressing the green issues is the duty of one transnational organization. Firstly, there are plenty of reasons that lead to environmental problems such as air pollution, global warming, deforestation and even more severe natural calamities like ice-melting in both North and South Pole, greenhouse effect, ozone depletion. Those causes that I have just mentioned occur worldwide and have negative impacts on all countries regardless of how wealthy they are. No single nation can deal with these issues completely, thus having a global organisation to solve these problems would allow greater cooperation among countries. Secondly, some undeveloped countries may lack experience and required techniques to tackle the green issues effectively. Therefore, unless rich countries subsidize poor ones, it would be impossible to wipe out those matters.\r\nOn the other hand, I am in favor of the idea that every local government should handle their own environmental problems. Each nation has its own issues which stem from a variety of causes and as a result, different approaches and solutions must be imposed timely to minimize the consequences of these problematic issues. For instance, in recent years, China has experienced a serious air pollution due to the huge amount of exhausted fumes emitted by personal vehicles. In order to remedy this problem, Chinese authority has lifted a ban to vehicles commuting in major cities during rush hours. Meanwhile, some countries in Africa have to suffer a severe drought that results in thousands of people have insufficient fresh water. Hence, it is undoubted that every nation should come up with their distinct solution to handle their green issues.\r\nIn conclusion, although it is argued that the duty of preserving the environment should fall to one international organization instead of local governments, I do believe that this phenomenon should be coped with together to get the maximum effects.",

        "essay": "People argue that, to gain a successful career, learning at university or college is inevitable. In contrast, other people believe that receiving a job after finishing study at school might be more approachable. From my perspective, I believe both higher education and employment  after school can lead to different career paths to achieve success. I will discuss the higher education and job prospects below to support my point of view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo gain a successful career, studying at university and college is the best for the major which is complex and sophisticated such as mathematics, chemistry and physics to achieve success. Those majors mainly focus on developing the previous theories or mysterious problems which require a lot of experiments to examine the data to support the potential theories. In this case, studying at university and college could be a huge opportunity to receive guidance from professors and tutors who have achieved academic success in their field allowing them to work as a team to contribute their own intelligence for those problems. Moreover, with the funds from those institutions, some expensive equipment for experiment purposes is available to assist those problems to process the outcome. Eventually, there’s are much likely to gain a breakthrough while they choose to further study at university and college.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo achieve a successful career, working after school is appropriate for some majors which  rely highly on the experience such as teacher, translator and commercial management. School can only help to establish a basic framework and provide necessary skills for students to work in those fields after graduation. However, a practical experience allows those skills and knowledge to apply in realistic situations, such as human resources management and high efficient teaching methods, to review and develop the basic framework they learn from school and master their skills at the same time. After the gained experience, they are able to help as many people as they can to gain their own success.\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe that studying sophisticated majors at university and college could be an advantage in terms of difficulties, and I also believe that getting a job straight after school is able for students who choose a skilled major to achieve a successful career.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Some believe that humans should accept the climate change problem and should try to live with this situation, on the contrary, others think it would be better if we understand it and take action to prevent its impacts. While I accept finding a way to stay with it, I believe that it would be better if we can prevent it in advance by being aware of our lifestyles in order to provide a quality of life for us and the coming generations.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, climate change is the main problem that humans have faced recently for several decades and it does affect our life beings, while a growing number of research has confirmed that human activity is one of the main causes contributing to this change. Regarding the negative effects of this situation, it is essential for us to take action to avoid further devasting effects of climate change such as losing biodiversity and extinction of existed species. There are simple methods that we can apply to cope with this problem instead of neglecting it. For example, most countries nowadays try to promote clean energy by replacing fossil energy and also encourage domestic businesses to maintain their Carbon emission. These measures can help to secure the future for the younger generation to live in this world peacefully. Consequently, preventing climate change by changing our individual activities is a must and turns out to be the most effective way towards this significant situation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people tend to believe that humans should learn to live with climate change. This might be because they prefer to accept nature's outcomes as the best solution since it is hard to prevent the natural phenomenon. Thus, we should take risks on climate change and find other ways to survive. As a result, some technology has been invented to help humans in order to support the changing lifestyles. For instance, there are some innovations established to fight against those effects of climate change such as the system warning for tsunamis and earthquakes as well as drought climate detection for crop protection. With a help of advanced technology, we could possibly stabilize our long lives towards the severe weather condition.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I partially disagree with the view that we should ignore those changes in weather, but instead, we should be aware of our lifestyles since it is one of the main causes driving an increase in temperature around the world. Trying to live with climate change should always be the value that we keep in mind, but it is not because we intend to do nothing to protect our nature, conversely, we as humans, need to awake and try to prevent it as much as we can to ensure a better place for the next generations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that climate change could be prevented by changing our lifestyles and raising awareness among us. However, in my opinion, it is a necessity to live and learn from the failures that we have made to nature in order to sustain this world effectively.",

In this essay, I will look through some pros and cons of this issue.\r\n\r\nFirstly, regarding the advantages of online courses, it should be admitted that online lessons are much cheaper than the ones on campus, because the university authority could be able to spend no investment on any facilities in a university building. In addition, they can economize the expenditure on the salaries of the staff members. Thus, the universities might gain considerable profit through online lessons. Moreover, online  lectures and seminars would prevent the problems with an infrastructure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are certain drawbacks of utilizing online interactions in an education. We can see this when these types of courses seem to be boring to do regularly, or to emerge some technical difficulties with an access to the Internet. In other words, not all places do have available amenities or facilities to be involved in online courses. Furthermore, online lessons might be harmful to the visual ability of its participants, on account of the requirement to be front of the screen stably.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, albeit there are manifold positive sides of online courses to the university authority like less expenditure on the staff salaries and the opportunity to avoid problems with the infrastructure, there are certain negative sides as well like the lack of the Internet access and damage to the visual ability of the participants.

        "essay": "In today's world,a lot of adults have begun to think that it will be better for them to give  birth to a child in a more mature age than people used to do in the past. There are different reasons which could support this decision and its benefits, but also there are some drawbacks which will be discussed in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it has become extremely popular among women to get pregnant at the age of 30-35 while earlier it was important to become a mother before 20. First of all, in the past,the main role of a woman was to be a good housewife and take care of children. This is because there were a lot of prejudices about the female part of  society and their duties to the world. Therefore, young girls used to think about pregnancy at the age of 18 since they were told that after this age it would be difficult to get a good family. For instance, the majority of women who lived in the Soviet Union under the pressure of  society were forced to give  birth at a very young age.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach. Firstly, when a person becomes a parent at an adult age it is likely to have more opportunities for his child and would be able to be responsible for someone's life. On the other hand, with the time woman's ability to get pregnant decreases and it might be hard to give  birth at the age of 30. For example, some female could become infertile due to the fact that they didn't give  birth when they were young.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the major reason for people to think about pregnancy at the more adult age is that they would be more responsible and would have an ability to give their infants everything they would need for  development.

        "essay": "It is often said that technological advancements are rapidly changing the way we live, work, and learn. The traditional classroom setting of a teacher instructing a group of students may be considered outdated by the year 2050. While I agree that the role of teachers and students in the classroom may change, I believe that the traditional teaching situation will still exist to some extent. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technology has already begun to revolutionize the way we learn. Online education, for example, has become increasingly popular and has allowed individuals to access educational resources from anywhere in the world. In addition, virtual classrooms and video conferencing have made it possible for students and teachers to connect and communicate without the need for a physical classroom. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has also impacted the way we learn. These technologies can personalize learning experiences for each individual, allowing students to work at their own pace and receive customized feedback. This has the potential to transform traditional teaching and learning methods and create a more individualized approach to education. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do not believe that the typical teaching situation will completely disappear. While technology has its benefits, there are certain aspects of learning that require face-to-face interaction. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom can be invaluable, as it provides students with the opportunity to ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and engage in group discussions. The classroom environment also promotes socialization and collaboration, which are essential skills for students to develop. Moreover, the traditional teaching situation provides a sense of structure and routine that can be beneficial for students. The physical classroom creates a learning space where students can focus and eliminate distractions. It also establishes a routine for students, which can help them develop good study habits and time management skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the teaching situation in the year 2050 may be different from what we know today, I believe that the traditional classroom setting will still exist to some extent. While technology may transform the way we learn, the physical presence of a teacher and the classroom environment provide benefits that cannot be replaced by digital tools.

Firstly, listening to music can aid to relax both workers and students, after a hectic day. Eventually, the relaxed mind can be recharged, due to this, they would be active in their home or hostel and able to do  household work as well  homeworks. Secondly, this is the best time for the socialization by making  friendship with other commuters during the travelling.

For example, an average citizen has no need to heat the information about wars, conflicts, weather catastrophics, etc. happening in other countries, if it is only not linked with his or her own region.

        "essay": "It is believed by some that adverts are not necessary and they are not manipulated by advertisements when they go shopping. Although this may be true to a certain extent, it is my firm belief that advertisements still have influences on customers. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are reasons why buyers think advertisements are not helpful. To begin with, feedback coming from relatives or friends could be one of the most reliable recommendations. In other words, customers often opt for choosing goods from the shop that they have heard about. For instance, a lot of Vietnamese people purchase products at the shop about which they have received positive comments from their friends or relatives. Moreover, several people may find it a waste of time when watching adverts. Instead of spending time  watching lots of advertising campaigns, they could do many other useful activities, such as reading books or learning new knowledge. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am firmly convinced that advertisements play a fundamental role in persuading buyers. First and foremost, today’s advertisements often have high quality. They usually have an attractive appearance and provide enough information for customers. As a result, buyers might choose the products. Secondly, lots of companies and brands these days invite celebrities to appear in their advert campaigns. As a result, these advertisements may have great influences on the fans of these celebrities. To illustrate this point, products advertised by Son Tung M-TP, a famous singer in Vietnam, often have a high rate of buyers. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are some who are not affected by advertisements, I strongly believe that adverts still have certain impacts on the buying decisions of customers.",

        "prompt": "Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.\r\nTo begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.\r\nOn the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.\r\nHaving considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools.",

        "essay": ", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.",

        "essay": "Global warming has become one of the most conspicuous topics in the twenty-first century. Some individuals argue that it is better to live with this phenomenon instead of  finding some ways to address these problems. Base on plenty of reasons, such as having devastating effects on peoples' lives, I totally disagree with this issue. \r\n\r\nFirstly, global warming can contribute to lots of devastating phenomena like floods and landslides. These types of events put people at risk. There is a multitude of people who are exposed to these kinds of hazards and they might lose their lives every year. For instance, there was a huge tsunami in Japan which had become the main reason for losing Japanese lives. Therefore, humankind is facing catastrophic events due to climate change, however, this alteration is gradual. Thus, scientists have to spot some ways to solve the problems. \r\n\r\nSecondly, this hazard has another implication, the extinction of animals can be rooted in this event's results. When one special kind of animal dies out, it has never been brought back. It is happening steadily, but the results are harmful. For example, Asian Lions have been wiped out because of the earth weather change due to Carbon dioxide emission. Base on these facts, governments should invest a large amount of money for addressing this obstacle. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our planet has faced  many different cycles of warming and cooling. So someone thinks that global warming is one of this cycle and we would accept it. Due to  loads of results from academic researches, it became clear that Mammoths were extinct because the weather had become warmer. Generally, this view might be correct, but the severity of that event is not like the problems that we have to manage these days. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, climate change can be the main reason for many catastrophes which are not manageable, due to these facts, I totally disagree with this issue.",

        "essay": "It is thought by some people that we ought to live with climate change instead of trying to reverse or prevent it. I completely disagree with this as there is no way to coexist with climate change.\r\nIt is almost impossible to live in a world that suffers from global warming since multiple evidences exist to show how badly affected the earth is. For example, the weather has severely changed in recent decades and the temperature is always increasing. This change in the weather has contributed to several disasters such as wildfires in various countries in the world, hurricanes, floods, droughts, as well as melting glaciers. Additionally, many species are endangered because their natural habits are threatened by global warming.\r\nThe reasons why all these environmental issues started are human activities, and thus, we must be responsible for what we did. Numerous steps can be taken by humans to stop climate change and reverse its effects. Scientists and environmentalists have been working hand in hand to find methods that can mitigate climate change. For instance, many projects are being carried worldwide to plant more trees in order to absorb as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as possible. Carbon dioxide, which is one of the greatest contributors to global warming, has been released in abundance due to deforestation. Due to that, planting trees is a plausible countermeasure to deforestation. Moreover, other methods to eliminate climate change include reducing pollution, banning plastics, becoming vegan, and using environmentally friendly transportation methods, such as cycling.\r\nTo conclude, the catastrophic impact that climate change has on earth makes it unimaginable to find a way to live with it instead of preventing it. We are all part of one ecosystem and the decline of one of its parts leads to severe consequences for everyone.",

        "essay": "There have been significant developments in relation to communication in recent years, however it is often argued that this technological progress had had a detrimental effect on many people’s relationships. Although in numerous cases damage is being done to social interactions, I also strongly maintain that there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication.\r\nCorresponding online can clearly be a hindrance in many situations. The principal drawback is that social websites such as Facebook can be very addictive, therefore people spend less time communicating face to face. It is commonplace to see group of friends or family members who are gathered together in a social situation, however their main focus is frequently their smartphones. Secondly, the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging. Due to the fact that posts and group messages are often sent without the recipient knowing the sender personally, users are frequently more thoughtless, or even abusive, compared to what they can be held accountable for their words.\r\nDespite the aforementioned harmful aspects, the latest communication devices are also advantageous in a variety of respects. Firstly, prior to the introduction of the internet, there were limited opportunities to keep in contact with others. Many examples have been seen of childhood friends who lost contact as a result of moving to a new town or attending a diffrerent university. With the introduction of social networking, this situation is now easily avoidable. In addition, social media also provides opportunities to build new relationships with likeminded people. By taking advantage of social groups and mutual friend recommendations, connections can now be built anywhere across the world. Looking back 20 years, it was uncommon for friends to be made outside of a local community.\r\nTo conclude, there is no doubt that communication methods have been revolutionised over the last two decades. Whether this progression benefits or harms people socially, however, depending largely on individual circumstances. To avoid the potential issues presented above, it is vital that sufficient time is also devoted to more traditional forms of socialising.",

This is one of the main factors which might affect significantly global issues needing a hand from the government. In some areas, the governments adjust the number of vehicles by increasing the fuel price, while I firmly disagree because this route could give more back draws than benefits.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it undoubtedly agrees that increasing the cost of fuel may reduce the traffic travelers as well as the depletion of oil resources and air pollution. Those, who have the average salary or be in poverty, will consider the fuel segment from the total personal expenditure than those who belong to top-notch. These groups may mitigate the expenses by transforming public transportation instead of personal mobility. This method is a considerable short-term measure to work on air qualification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the convenience of traveling by own cars or vehicles is not demolished even with the growth of public transportation. Residents might go by foot in some distance to catch the bus or train. In the addition, how to shorten the time to travel is more likely their priority in long term. Moreover, rising the cost of conventional fuels could imbalance the market by rising the other materials simultaneously. This leads to a more crucially serious which is called inflation spiralled out of control which may mitigate life condition standards.

Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "Nowadays, the Internet has become without doubt the most powerful, convenient and free source of information and communication. It has dramatically changed how we communicate with each other and how we obtain news. With only one push of button on our devices like a smart phone or a laptop we can speak our family members who are thousand miles away from us or read current news without a need for watching TV or buying a newspaper. However, this convenience of the Internet carries some potential threats to the users such as violation of their privacy rights and overflow of unreliable information. Therefore, the users should demand some forms of regulations of the Internet to reduce these risks.\r\nCertainly, the use of the Internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. Unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the Internet. For example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. However, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. This practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the Internet. For this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the Internet.\r\nAnother risk of having the Internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. I find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the Internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. Now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the Internet. Simply, people can write and post their comments that often don’t have any factual or scientific base. We have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the COVID-19. Many people who objected to be vaccinated made up their mind reading some posts on the Facebook or the Twitter that stated harmfulness of vaccines. These posts are allowed to be posted, because the social media don’t have any obligation to check the content of posts. Clearly, this wouldn’t happen if there were some forms of regulations that can verify better factual content of information on the Internet, so the potential readers can avoid the risk of misinformation.\r\nSurely, the Internet can no longer stay without any regulatory laws. These policies are necessary to protect our privacy and keep us informed with more reliable information. Simply, the regulation polices of the Internet give us more power to be in control when using the Internet to obtain information or share personal data.",

        "essay": "Due to the accelerating pace of modernization, people have been influenced by the different ways of pursuing their jobs. Therefore, research indicates that in the coming years' a large proportion of people will choose to telecommute. In my opinion, people will definitely consider the option of work from home, but despite this, there will be still a few professions which need human presence rather than a digital environment. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are numerous reasons why most of the occupation could be done while sitting at a home. Because modern technology has made it possible for both the employer and employees to carry on their jobs anywhere and anytime. It is seen that online social media portals provide the opportunity for people to start their offline and online business so that they can work from any corner of the world. Consequently, the trend will bring cost-effectiveness for the worker as they could save their time and money to commute to and from the work. According to the  convenience point of view, it is anticipated that the vast majority of the population will choose to work from home option. For example, the Enagic Company of U.S.A, offering the number of online employments and people are earning a handsome amount of salary while working at their own pace. Thus, online occupations are an absolute imperative.\r\n\r\nConversely, there are few jobs which could not be done during our homestay. Because these kinds of professions, demands the human-beings involvement which is otherwise impossible to pursue if there will be the absence of an individual. For instance, a doctor could not examine their patients from the home, no doubt there are virtual appointments available for the people but in the cases of serious medical conditions, the doctor's presence is necessary. Overall, it is true that jobs such as corporate, project management, software developer and many more could be easily done from one's comfort zone, though lifesaver occupation is in the demand of expert's presence.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is true that the influence of technology is escalating in the work sectors. Likewise, in the future, more and more work will be done from the home. I firmly agree with the notion, but all jobs will not be  part of a massive shift.",

Firstly, this essay will discuss how it affects relations and secondly, we will examine how it is good for children's learning.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the generation gap plays a significant role in holding families together. To elaborate, the mentality and lifestyle of the people change as per time and if there is more difference of it in generations, then the relationships are hard to remain stable thus splitting the families apart. For example, in our neighbourhood, there are old parents who had their offsprings quite younger and they could not cope up with the way their children used to live, therefore, all of their children left them alone. In spite of this, if the ageing rift is less, then the families are expected to have healthy relations and better understanding.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, a small gap in the age of elder ones and younger ones in families have incredibly helped those children excel in their academic and professional careers. To further explain, a person's knowledge and experience should be up-to-date in this advanced technology era and if the parents are not too older than their kith and kins, then it becomes obvious that they will assist them to compete in this fast-paced world. For instance,  younger couples are nowadays focusing on teaching their children about the computer and technology by being their mentors. Moreover, the large generation gap sometimes becomes a hindrance in the children's journey to success in terms of not supporting his ideas.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the generation gap plays a major role in defining the strength of relationships among the family members and the exposure of the children. As mentioned above, less the age difference, more is the understanding and affection between adults and youngsters, along with that, it also plays a key role in child nourishment. Hence, I believe that the disadvantages of greater generation gap outweigh its advantages.",

        "essay": "Cutting-edge technology has been upgrading the modern lifestyle with its widespread availability. Some analysts claim that it is the cause of widening the gap between the affluent and the indigent, while others opine the opposite view. However, In my opinion, I would consent to the former notion that the more earning people attain more amenities of the advanced technology, eventually, rich people become richer while the poor become poorer. \r\nOn one side of the argument, some people believe that the distance between the wealthy people and the impoverished has been enhancing gradually because of having less trouble to access sophisticated technology. This is because modern facilities are significantly expensive, and sometimes only affordable for rich people. To exemplify, modern appliances such as washing machine, vacuum cleaner, air conditioner, etc. have brought more convenience in the regular life. Thus, only the wealthy person can make it possible to lead a better life with the aid of up-to-date technology. \r\nOne the other hand, others provide the opposing case that the diverse range of modern avails can generate a balanced society. The reason for their belief is that the leading-edge technology creates numerous online job opportunities such as online food delivery service, online riding service and so on. Consequently, this advancement makes a great contribution to the poor people's livings through earning extra money.\r\nHowever, In my opinion, though advanced technology emanates the source of income for the poor, ultimately, the affluent acquire the amenities of this tremendously than the impoverished. For instance, all the high profile businesses can potentially afford the highly expensive necessaries to accelerate their productivity whereas the poor countries hardly manage.

This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.\r\nOn the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills.

While society emphasizes to volunteer wor, but I believe that this can either help society or individual. \r\n\r\nThere are various reasons why society should not force young people to take part in unpaid activities. Firstly, students always find themselves busy with homework and exam revisions; even sometimes it seems like full time job as their school schedule follows tuition. For example, in India, school children stay from 9 am to 3 pm in schools, and after the visit , tuition to cover up their homework, which is quite hectic.

In my view, although galleries bear an essential role to educate, involving various entertaining elements may attract many young people to attain new knowledge. \r\n\r\nMuseums are mostly operating to provide indispensable information to all segments of the population. Most of them display many invaluable artefacts depicting the historical background of a nation of a country. So, when young generations absorb verbal information, they have been taught, by visiting museums visual experiences can supplement this knowledge. For example, the Historical Museum of Azerbaijan has a very impressive collection of historical and cultural objects belonging to different epochs of our country and most probably, when schoolchildren see those items, they can easily expand their knowledge about historical events.

An increase in the number of visitors may also bring more revenue which in turn can be used for improving the quality of exhibitions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that museums play an enormous role in providing scientific knowledge to youngsters, adding more entertaining elements will attract more people on the one hand and can help to boost the revenue of the institutions on the other hand.",

        "essay": "Environmental conservation has become a trending topic in recent years. Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development.",

        "essay": "In this fast changing modern era, every age- group need certain facilities for their survival. Although half part of the population believes that after retirement people should get support from the government, the other part  thinks just opposite to it, they want every individual must save money for the future when they are working. I will put shine on both the sides. In my opinion, it is important for the society and law take care of old people.\r\nTo embark with, there are several reasons why some masses holding a view in against of providing facilities like financial help for older people. First of all, the government can introduce a more development project which helps to improve the country's economy and growth instead of giving benefiting services to retired people. For instance, latest studies prove that many nations ban these facilities after retirement and focuses more on construction on developing valuable public projects. In addition, it is seen that sometimes relatives or others cheat on retired people to get money for their service. This is why some people may not get these benefits.\r\nOn the contrary, nowadays survival becomes relatively difficult due to a lot of competition in every field. First and foremost, after a certain age,  people lost their physical power to perform labour work such as worker in factory and driver etc.. So, in this situation they need support financially for the basic needs of human beings that is home, footwear, clothes, and foot etc. Moreover, in toady's world, there are some sons and daughters who leave their parents alone, for them ministry needs to build more old- age home where they get proper basic needs and take care. Even the rapidly rising cost of living and food item adversely effect retired people who do not have adequate savings.\r\nTo encapsulate the whole notion, I gather that retired people contribute their life in  the development of society. Furthermore after retirement, it's society's and governance duty to take care of these people and ensure their better survival.",

While some argue that lessons can never access the quality of in-person education, Online learning programs can be just as beneficial in the same situation, a particular circumstance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  First, online education programs ensure flexibility and convenience that traditional face-to-face class opportunities sometimes need to be improved.

This essay will elaborate and consider the reasons behind this and discuss the possible way of the findings.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, there are two major reasons for the people digging into the history of their residence. To begin with, most of the adults are mature and curious to understand the story of the hardship and sacrifices done by their ancestors in the development of the home. By studying this, they intend to value the dedication of their previous generation to the betterment of themselves and their future generation. In addition to this, the findings of history not only help to recognize one’s identity but also motivate themselves to preserve the memories and build their own house in the future. Jaipur Palace, for instance, is well known for its richness and history and is well maintained by many generations of the king who built it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are multiple ways and sources where people can do their research. First of all, they can have detailed discussions with their close-knit family members. To cite an example, parents or grandparents, undoubtedly are the best guide to explore every branch and root of one’s residential place history. Secondly, if the place of residence is a cultural heritage, the internet can help to give a broader view of understanding of history. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would argue that there is a mix of curiosity and interests, leading people to explore the past of their residing houses which benefits themselves.

        "essay": "Some people believe that retirees should be given monetary supports by the government while others think that they should be made to cater for themselves. I will be expatiating on this and as well give my opinion in subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is arguable that government should be made to shoulder the financial upkeep of their retired citizenry, it is quite burdernsome. The financial toll of running the country is already high in various countries and adding to this might be unsustainable. For example, the cost of running Niger, as recorded by the 2003 United Nations Report for Countries in Africa, was about 3.5 trillion dollars which was way above the country's earnings. Thus, countries should not add the cost of financial welfare of their inactive populace to the already high cost of running their nation.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that people should be made to take responsibility for their finances even after their active years. This is because as humans work, it is reasonably expected of them to have retirement plans and not rely on others for their survival. Moreso, when a person takes a job at a young age, it is imperative of him to save up for later when he will be less productive. It is therefore unfair for people who had all the time to plan for their retirement to place financial burden on the state. Thus, as an example, a factory worker should save up and take care of his monetary needs rather than squandering his earnings and placing his hope on the state for upkeeps.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, rather than making the government cater for the financial needs of retired citizens, retirees should be left alone to take care of themselves monetarily",

Firstly, adolescenceis a complex phase and it is completely different from the other stages of psychological development. Teenagers during this phase are more inclined towards learning and exploring new things. Thus, engaging youngsters in voluntary community work such as helping students from poorer section of the society with their studies will increase their cognitive skills. Moreover,adolescents are less likely to involve in bad activities. For example,recent survey has shown that youngters who are participating in community work are reported less in juvenile crime and drug abuse cases.

        "essay": "There is a fierce controversy about whether children should be punished when committing crimes or whether their parents must be the persons to receive punishments because they fail to educate their offspring. While some agree that parents of young criminals should be punished, I would argue that people should be responsible for their illegal actions regardless of their age, but parents also should educate their children about what is right and wrong.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people often assume that a child who commits a crime on purpose is less likely to come from a well-educated family. Their parents may be collar-blue workers who are busy making money to make ends meet so they do not have much time to talk and share with their children let alone read and research the information related to children's psychology. In addition, if parents are criminals, their children will be more likely to become one. Children's worldwide views will  be shaped when they live with criminals as they witness their family members commit crimes on a daily basis. They will be clueless about what is acceptable and unacceptable thus becoming violent and heartless when they grow older.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would argue that children should be punished when committing crimes as it is important for them to understand the laws and rules so that they will feel more discouraged to commit crimes again after release. Their family background can distort the true value of life, but they have the power to relearn it. Rehabilitation centres or exclusive prisons for juveniles give young individuals a chance to see the world from different angles and gain  insight into the law. They, therefore, may become more open-minded and compassionate. Furthermore, parents should pay more attention to their offspring and invest time and effort in reading and researching  children's psychology \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although people argue parents of young criminals  should be strictly punished for their children's wrongdoings, I believe that children should take punishments on their own because of the potential benefits mentioned above. Instead of blaming the parents of young criminals, the public should encourage each other to always strive to educate our children better.",

        "essay": "There are many crucial subjects for children to learn and find what they like, art is also included. However, there is an argument that is art should be included as an essential subject for children. The following paragraph will be discussing both opinions. Therefore, the conclusion will be reaching.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people think that it will be wasting of time to learn the art. This group might believe that children should learn more logical subjects such as math and science to make them think more logically because they believe that humans should have logical thinking more than creative thinking. Many people believe that those who possess high logical thinking will make their life more reasonable than people who possess high creative thinking.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it is undeniable that many folks still choose art to be their mainstream subject. Since art also provides creative thinking, which is essential for the population to live or have a successful career. For example, to make a successful career path as an entertainer or an artist. Also, these people have contrast ideas with the latter group. Children should have learned creative thinking in their child age because it is hard to gain once adults.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that both opinions are correct. However, it depends on the child to choose what they want because each of the youngsters has their interests and unique abilities to use.

        "essay": "Doing voluntary jobs is one of many ways to contribute in society's development. Nowadays, many youngsters are devoting their leisure time into the community welfare activities which not only help them to have a real life experience, but also give them a chance to work for the humanity. Therefore, it is imperative to know whether  beneficial or not. While adolescents are not earning anything from such activities, I believe that voluntarism develops the teenager's personality and reduces a society's disparity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, working for nonprofit organizations, the young ones come across with different communities and experienced professionals, whom they can learn the dynamics of works. Juveniles enhance the communication skills by socialization as well as enable leadership qualities, to take part in communal clubs, thereby they get that healthy environment, which is essential for their mental capabilities. For instance, in the USA, many young people are participating in the public welfare events during the summer's and winter's vacations to acquire the practical knowledge that can aid them in future when they would start searching for a job. Thus, the young blood can be trained for the prospective challenges what anticipate in the coming period.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, different background teenagers take part in this noble cause without making money that brings them close to each others. Throughout the activities, all members of communal groups have been treated as equal by the equal responsibilities and rights remove the inequality among them. Referring to a previous example, in the USA, young bodies is being worked in a togetherness that is essential to drive smoothly the multicultural USA life style. Hence, to achieve the country's stability, it is pertinent young citizens put some time in the community works.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is vital to encourage young citizens to indulge in philanthropy's occupations. Taking part in the local welfare events leads an individual having a strong character and well-managed nation due to this, I strongly in the favour of youngsters' volunteering work decision.",

        "essay": "There is no doubt that watching television is seen as an indispensable part of people's lives. However, some people argue that watching television is bad for children, while others believe that it has many benefits for children. In my view, there are both disadvantages and advantages to watching television, which will be discussed below.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are some negative effects that young people can get from watching television. For example, if they spend too much time watching television, they may develop eye problems. They may also become addicted to television. They also become isolated from society because they spend their time watching TV without doing any outdoor activities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it cannot be denied that watching TV has many benefits for children. It can help develop their imagination and find their passion by watching celebrities or inspiring people. Watching TV also enchants their knowledge. For example, there are a lot of educational TV shows, it will help the children to learn some soft skills or also academic knowledge. Besides, when children watch TV, they may have opportunities to improve their language skills such as listening and reading. For example, almost all TV shows speak very fast, so if they want to understand what they are watching, they need to improve their listening skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, children watching TV has both advantages and disadvantages, it will bring a lot of benefits if they use their time wisely and choose the program that suits their age.

I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.\r\nI think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.\r\nContinuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.\r\nAlso i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them.

It is agreed ,that people make environment suffer from these and some of the negative impacts are irreparable,however, others claim that some measures can be taken to save nature. This essay,firstly,will discuss how people's actions can influence nature in an adverse way without hope to fix it,followed by an analysis of what solutions can be suggested,before coming to a reasoned conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some activities considered to be really dangerous for forest habitats,such as hunting. Unfortunately, the majority of people do not understand the difference between farm animals who were grown to be killed for eating purposes and the habitats of the wild environment. Moreover, some species are at the edge of extinction due to people's inappropriate behaviour. In addition, there are other types of activities which harm animals,such as feeding bread to birds,as it swells in their stomach and makes them suffer from pain,which can lead even to their death. Also, for example, weeds ,which are considered to be harmful to plants, have a positive impact on soil,because they can help to defend plants from insects,but people remove them repeatedly and it leads to a decrease in the amount of them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is extremely important to provide people with information about the consequences which their actions can cause. Furthermore, the government should make a system of high fines ,in order to defend plans and animals,because the majority of people do not understand the importance of saving nature. For example, feeding bread to birds is considered to be a good action ,as someone thinks that they help animals, nevertheless, if they knew about real outcomes,they would not do this. Thus, it is necessary to keep humanity aware of risks, so that it will be possible to avoid dangers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, this essay agrees that some  activities make nature suffer and something is too late to change ,however, there are some measures that can be taken to prevent future harm",

        "essay": "Nowadays, choosing the right school for children is gaining popularity in ambiguous parts of the society. With the autonomy of choosing mixed-gender or single-gender classrooms, the parents are debating their choices. However, some feel that the children attending single-sexed schools may suffer in the future years of their life. In this essay, I will explain how single-sex institutions can affect the after journey of students.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, this can drastically change their confidence level to communication. Although, the pupil in the learning institutions are taught how to talk with manners but socialising with someone of the opposite sex can bring a little hesitation leading to not been able to present their ideas well. For instance, a girl studying in \"only girls\" college may find it hard to make guy friends \r\n\r\n. Therefore, children from thay schooling might not be very comfortable to socialise in the unisex environment.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this might affect some individuals thinking process. Most people from the single-sex schools might find it hard to form a relationship with other genders as they might consider it a wrong thing. For example, in countries like India, especially during the old times, girls who had friends from opposite genders were judged as a bad person. Hence, in the same gender schools the thinking process continues to be like the old times.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, I strongly agree education can work wonders to groom a human being boy having the right atmosphere and multi-gender environment around can prepare the individual in every situation. Therefore, co-educational learning system should be considered by adults while preparing the child's future.",

        "essay": "Environmental problems like climate change and the greenhouse effect are increasingly becoming the topic in most conferences and forums. Although a school of thought to think that increasing fuel prices for automobiles would solve these problems, I strongly disagree with this view. This essay will argue that this option will not only negatively affect the cost of living of low-income earners, but also, it will be a wrong approach to solving climate change issues.\r\n\r\nFirstly, An increase in the pump price of fuels will result in an increase in transportation cost and in general, the cost of living in the society. Consequently, the average standard of living will drop. The rate of poverty is on the increase and many families struggle to put food on their tables. For instance, a man who currently earns less than required to sustain his family and is just getting by, will be pushed into depression and possibly suicide when he realizes his salary can no longer meet his family's needs. In addition, many companies will lose workers as their wages may not cover the cost of transportation to work.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are other sources of energy that could be researched into for possibilities of replacing the use of fuels that affect our environment.  These could be renewable sources like water and wind. Authorities should disburse funds to research centres and institutes  enough to enable the scientists to work more to discover how hydro-power can be used in vehicles and other engines instead of atmosphere damaging fuels. For example, a climate change activist travelled from China to Geneva to attend the last climate change summit in Geneva using an emission-free boat. She did not need to join world leaders who came in private jets that further added to the problem they were supposedly going to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all of humankind must take responsibility for the environment but definitely not at the expense of the people who barely make enough money to get by. Government and responsible agencies should seek other ways to rescuing our environment and ensure the world is safe again.",

        "essay": "Some people tend to encourage high school students to evaluate their teachers so that the education system would get better, while others believe it results in the disappearance of  respect and self-control during classes. I agree with the idea that students are able to leave a comment for teachers and I will discuss the point of view of both sides below.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there would be some disadvantages of evaluating teachers for students in high schools. Firstly, for example, how to criticise properly takes time to learn, preventing nonsense comments. It might distract students from the main academic lessons on which teachers spend a vast amount of time. Next, teachers can not correct what juveniles do wrong. For avoiding negative comments, teachers are unable to point out mistakes that students make when it may make students furious so that they do not know how they should improve their manners.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I still believe that students are supposed to be motivated to express what they want to say about their teachers. One key reason why is that conveying is important for a student. Leading students to show their thought would be a good  lesson. Also, adjusting the way to teaching is another consideration. Teachers can understand what they can transform with those comments when their own teaching style might not fit all of the students.\r\n\r\nTo conclude with, there must be some disadvantages for that students are able to criticise teachers.

        "essay": "Based on some alledges, publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans' requirements. Although in my point of view, commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands. However, some other factors are uttered here.\r\nOne of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals. To enlighten, some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities, as, not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things. As a vivid case, Japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries, while other companies, such as American ones, have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels.\r\nFurthermore, based on the alternations that have taken place in the world, like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle, both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts. For instance, individuals' usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade, due to the lack of time for cooking, hence the development of takeaways is eye-catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply.\r\nOn the other hand, whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms, it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge. To illustrate, the main role is played by second-to-none commuting systems for delivering divergent products, therefore without their assistance, introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices.\r\nTo conclude, while publicity, nowadays, is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets, to me, it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things.

From my perspective, I believe that we have become more reliant than at any time in  history.\r\n\r\nDue to technological advancements, people are becoming lazier than ever. These days the majority of them depend on the internet to achieve their responsibilities and tasks. Despite the advantages that come from using the internet, it gives them a chance to be more reliant on others. For example, people rely on others to prepare food for them while they are away or at their work. Furthermore, technology has made people too busy and stay outside their homes for a long time. Therefore, parents depend on babysitters to upbringing their children and take care of them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the present generation, there is a percentage of people who are educated and tend to be more self-reliant because independence gives them  confidence and freedom, particularly the young generation. For instance, students tend to do part-time work during their studies in order to fulfil their needs without getting help from their parents. In addition to that, most of them take their own decisions about their future or pursuing their career since they want to depend on themselves.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although in certain ways people are more independent, it is generally the case that people now live more dependent lives. \r\n\r\n.",

Both views will be demonstrated in the forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in the last century, numerous environmental changes happened,including differences in the climate. Such as  the raising of the earth’s temperature,which leads to the most catastrophic issue , which is the melting of the ice in the Antarctica continent. Consequently, fluctuations in the business world have been happening ever since ,which divided people's opinions.Firstly, those who consider this effect as an obstacle lead to the withdrawal of work and its efficiency.For example, those who are endangered the most, most  people living in coastal cities ,especially  those who own shops or small businesses.

        "essay": "It cannot be denied that youngsters should volunteer them shelves to do some community-based work for their society during leisure time. This effort definitely will ad-on their resume which will greatly help in their career. I strongly agree with this notion and this essay will withstand my statement with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, young people are the backbone of every community. They have the responsibility to organize and participate in events such as awareness programs, helping the public and government in an emergency. As a result, they will get to know very well about their land, their people’s needs and their country’s situation at a very young age. Helping people without any expectation will extend their bond with their neighborhood. \r\n\r\nSecondly, Schools and colleges should encourage their students to do some welfare work in surrounding areas. Giving chance at a young age will lead them to work better for their community later on. Certainly, it will help them to become a good public leader. For example, Indian schools have groups like scout and guide, National Cadet Corps team, where students are encouraged to help underprivileged people. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe, it is true that training adolescents at a young age to work for their people will lead a healthy brotherhood around them. To be precise, it will help to become a self-fishless service mind adult in the future. Though they did an unpaid job, working in their free time will give them a good experience and it will help to improve their confidence at an early stage.

        "essay": "The importance of punishment in juvenile crime has become an increasingly debatable topic in modern societies, with conflicting views on whether children themselves or their parents should be punished. One school of thought endorses that children who have been an offender of a crime should be penalized, in sharp contrast skeptics argue that on behalf of them their parents should be got punishment. This essay discusses both  sides of the argument and draws a logical conclusion in the end.\r\n\r\nThe latter group reveals that if the parents were punished instead  the children would be shared a negative message to the culture and the new generation will not panic about performing crimes. For instance, if a child does not have a penalizing for a guilty, one does not take it seriously and other teenagers in the community also get a negative attitude to their mind, hence, it would possibly increase crime among teenagers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many people in society believe that the youngsters who have been offenders for their offences should be got punished. Then they would  panic to repeat the wrong behaviours. Furthermore, it would be a chance to avoid crime happening once again. For example, when one is caught by their parents for stealing money and punished by them, one understands the guilty and will never do the same misdeed. Therefore, punishment for a wrong is a must for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn nutshell, although some folks have thought that penalizing parents for children's offences is suitable, I believe that children must be punished for their misdeeds. It would be an advantage for the community, because it gives a contribution to the growing youth in the public, ergo, I firmly accord with the former group.",

Living in an apartment that has issues can be a thorn in one's flesh, because, a different owner may emerge someday and decide to eject the building occupants, as a result, getting a fresh apartment becomes challenging for the people involved. Furthermore, rented home research is also done to discover the personality of the mansion owner. Being abreast of the conduct of the landlord will help the building occupants to decide to stay back or look out for another one, rather than renew the rent when it expires. For instance, a particular building next to mine, was completely deserted due to pressure from an overbearing landlord. \r\n\r\nIn addition, peeps can know about their paid dwelling by enquiring from the old existing tenants. these people have more knowledge and helpful information that is needed  because they have spent some time in the apartment.

        "essay": "It is claimed that famous figures mislead young students since they are famous for their ideal lifestyles and appearances rather than their talents. I strongly support this statement since said individuals have a negative impact on a majority of teenagers' education and their mental wellbeing. \r\n\r\nFirstly, some celebrities may express bad behaviours such as usage of alcohol and offensive language, smoking, drinking, or even engaging in illegal activities. Several teenagers undoubtedly adapt those bad manners and become ill-mannered children. Next, most influencers have been faking their perfect visuals and trying to convey the idea that their lifestyles are ideal. For this reason, young people may begin to compare themselves with unrealistic standards and start to become materialists. Furthermore, being so leads to low self-esteem and mental health difficulties which is going to hinder students' capacity to concentrate on their studies.\r\n\r\nAlthough opponents of this idea state that not all influencers are attention-seekers and problematic beings,we can all acknowledge that the majority of famous people do more harm than good. In my opinion , most so-called figures are likely counterfeiting their ‘good-natured’ personalities to attract more followers around the world which can increase their income. Nevertheless, celebrities demonstrate that one can gain a large amount of money with minimal effort and without having to study or obtain an educational degree.Many sources consequently reported that today's youth would choose to become online influencers instead of pursuing professions that will benefit the world. This proves the significant damage done to the young adolescents' academic performance and their future.\r\n\r\nInfluencers don't just deceive wrong ideas; they also cause students to be distracted from learning. Hence, influencers have a detrimental effect on a lot of young people. I believe adults would need to educate teenagers about the consequences of online influences to prevent their misperceptions",

To start with some people counter that all people should have been healthy for any kind of sports, because health is more important in our daily lifestyle. To increase any type of health issue the facilities plays major role in any person life. The more facilities for any kind of workout help the people to get easily and can get motivated by the equipment.

In my opinion, I disagree that an interview is not a reliable method, and other methods are better. I believe that it is reliable, but there are many other methods which are equally good and the choice is on the recruiter as to which one they find suitable as per their needs. \r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why most large organizations choose interviews as their preferred criteria to hire people, one of them being able to judge the aspirant on basis of their interpersonal and communication skills. For instance, interviews have face-to-face interactions where the candidates have to answer in-prompt questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking case study type questions, employees can be evaluated on the ability to handle pressure, confidence, and their ability to think outside the box. \r\n\r\nHowever, many other selection methods have varied advantages. One of the commonly known methods is a written test. This selection basis is preferred when the focus is on judging the (theoretical/conceptual) knowledge of the person. Another conventional selection basis is group discussions by which a candidate can be judged on his communication skills and his ability to convince people. This form of the process is majorly used for jobs that require employees to interact with other people, for example, sales jobs. Last but not least, there can be a combination of these three methods like written tests, followed by group discussion and finally personal interview which will ensure the candidate is thoroughly judged on skills checking everything from personality traits to knowledge and also communication skills.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the hiring process depends on the job requirement.

So, it’s only natural for the buyers to be curious about the history of the building for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important reason for curiosity about the origin of a building, is safety. When one buys a house and plans on moving in with their family, they want to be certain that the material used in the construction of the building is compatible with the latest building codes. For instants, in the past century, asbestos was used in the walls, rainwater pipes, etc. but today it is known that it’s a hazardous substance, and even is considered a carcinogen.

These all can be reasons for asking around about a building's past.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to researching the history of a residence, several methods come to mind. The most obvious way is by asking the municipality. Since municipalities are obliged to keep records of all the constructions happening in the city, they are likely to be helpful when it comes to houses past. Another way of understanding a house’s origin is the house itself. The plan of the house, the materials and the appliances used, all can be vastly helpful when digging about its origin if no renovation has been done on the building. The third method is by asking around and talking to the neighbours. This is especially good.

However, in my ,opinion the usefulness in terms of cultural exchange, peace, medical advancements and economic growth of the society because of social television platform is far more than its disadvantages like eye health issues and concentration in studies which are absolutely manageable. This essay will elaborate regarding the aforesaid notion in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the first and foremost use of the internet as communication radio is strengthening the relationship among people in different countries. It results in cultural exchange as well as respect and acceptance of foreign traditions furthermore, helps in bringing a peaceful atmosphere across the globe. Secondly, it also has a significant role in sharing medical research and treatments through the latest updated news. The news related to the spreading of diseases holds paramount importance for humanity.

It is often argued that people are able to adapt themselves to climate alterations, but it lasts for thousand years and this is while climate change for people is extremely more comfortable than adapting themselves to this situation, which is unimaginable difficult and time-consuming. I fully agree with this fact that it is better for people to change climate and not to try to reconcile themselves with this situation. In turn, this essay will discuss ways to alter climate by people.\r\n    On the one hand, the more people cultivate trees, the more the weather will be cleaned. That is to say that trees are unthinkably capable to absorb the CO2 (carbon dioxide), which in high concentrations can damage human body cells and eventually leads to cell death, and this is while that trees can absorb carbon dioxide and easily convert it to oxygen, which is incredibly useful for everything in the world. For instance, in forest countries, where the number of trees are a lot, several kinds of cancer such as breast, brain, chest and stem cell cancers are extremely rare. In my opinion, enhancement of cultivated trees can secure the survival of planet Earth. To sum up, tree cultivation can help people to change the climate, significantly.    \r\n    On the other hand, the more people use fossil fuels, the higher increased weather temperature will happen. That is to say that consumption of fossil fuels is able to increase the atmospheric pollutants as well as the weather temperature causing several damages of environment such as increased melting icebergs and fires. For example, in the recent decade, which the weather temperature of the world became warmer by up to 2 oC, the rate of fires over the world increased by up to 12%.

        "essay": "It has been argued that the state should pay attention to environmental deterioration as well as accommodation related issues, in order to prevent illness and disease. I totally agree with the aforesaid notion. In this essay, I will discuss, in the first paragraph, how it would be feasible for the government with the support of levy paid by the community and in the second paragraph, the needfulness of  huge infrastructure and a large number of efforts which are only within the reach of government fundings.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the taxes paid by citizens of a nation are crucially significant and this collective amount which directly goes into the government's bank account should be utilised for people's benefit. In other words, almost every nation collects  legal taxes from their citizens such as property tax, water fine, housing contribution, business tax and taxes on the purchase of gold and allied elements. So, it is a moral responsibility of a country to look after the basic necessities such as a proper and livable environment along with housing facilities, especially for the people of the lower economic groups. For instance, in India, the city called 'Chandigarh' is the most well-organised city which is planned and monitored by authorities as far as environmental pollution and dwellings are concerned. As a result, the population in Chandigarh are more healthy and living in a spacious and clean atmosphere than the rest of the places.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to control pollution from various modalities and to provide decent living place needs extravagant resources, which are within a reach of any national fundings and it is not possible for a single individual or a group of people. To make it clear, I would like to exemplify that, air pollution can be controlled by applying stringent rules,  to next water pollution can be controlled by providing excellent sewage control channels, then noise disturbances can be minimized by no horn policies or setting appropriate regulations, after that farming which is the largest industry providing food could be supported with infrastructure, knowledge and subsidies to farmers. Finally, the slum areas could be converted into neat and clean apartments with basic amenities like electricity and water. All these things can be only done by  democracy as it requires  huge money.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a country should be responsible for providing a clean atmosphere and a healthy living place to their citizens. In my opinion, I believe that it is absolutely within the capacity of a nation and the taxes paid by people should be justified by giving them facilities.",

        "essay": "Cutting-edge technology has been adopted more and more in manufacturing currently. Experts assume that robots can replace humans to do some current jobs. In my opinion, there will be advantages and disadvantages to using this new kind of technology. \r\n\r\nConcerning positive aspects, robots can take over good production much more quickly and accurately than workers. Thus, it can help not only enhance labour productivity but also be more economical and profitable. In addition, robots can do some dangerous tasks instead of humans, for example, robots can take over expedition jobs or rescue people. Besides, they can do manual jobs that people are much bored doing such as delivering jobs or collecting trash, even doing housework. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, there will be some disadvantages to using robots. First, it can damage our vulnerable environment. Because robots can consume huge electricity for operation. However, fossil fuels are used to produce electricity. On the other hand, the more fossil fuels are used, the more adverse influence on the environment. Second, the unemployment rate will increase among people with low income and low-level education. Finally, due to heavy dependence on technology, robots demand costly repair and maintenance expenses in order to prevent robots from breaking down. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the application of robots in production will bring enormous benefits. Besides, it will be concerned about their negative impacts, especially their adverse effect on our environment.",

        "essay": "Whereas some argue that it is right that the government spends a lot of money on the arts, others claim that the government should invest more on health and education. In my opinion, although arts are relevant for society, spending on health and educations is more important.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the arts are relevant for a country, since they can bring awareness about society's issues. Thus, it is part of a government duty investing in music and video production among other types of arts. For example, an inequality of opportunities for people coming from suburban areas can be expressed by the music produced by authors which are living in that region. Consequently, the government investing on several kinds of arts is a way of allowing people to express their reality. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, health and education are essential blocks for a country's wealth. Hence, both a good health care system and high quality education need to be a priority for government spending. For instance, it is preferable investing in hospitals, schools, and universities instead of investing on other topics, such as either music or video production. Therefore, since health and education are fundamental for a society they need to come first when talking about public investments.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though the arts are important for expressing different society's realities, a proper medical care system and quality education are core necessities for a country. Then, I believe that the government should invest more on health and education than on the arts.",

Having a spacious public outdoor area not only cost a huge amount of taxpayers money but also need to use a huge public space source which ought to have better usage than squares or parks.

        "essay": "Not being able to focus on class is one of the main concerns in the early-age learning journey. From educational perspectives, there are two main reasons which are the mismatched learning styles, and long-term exposure to poor nutrition and lack of sleep. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is irrefutable that we all learn differently, and so do children. Some learn best by seeing, hearing or doing. Therefore, if the teachers only emphasize a specific learning style and apply it to all the children, this can result in a lack of focus and understanding. In this case, the solution is to ask the teachers to observe what are the options that they can choose to engage children in their learning experiences. For example, inquiry-based learning projects can be planned and adapted to search for the right methods. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is sad to state, but, indeed, children cannot focus on their studies simply because they do not get enough sleep or nutrition. In fact, there are circumstances where many children do not have enough recommended sleeping hours or have to skip breakfast to be on time. Consequently, these children do not have energy and become distracted in class. As adults, we need to take our steps to reduce the numbers of children who have physical disadvantages. Government, schools and families have to work together to build up better schedules so children can have more time to sleep. Besides, they also must have free-food programs for poor children to make sure they are full when they study. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons which could lead to the failure of paying attention in the classroom.

        "essay": "It is true that some people are either unaware or not concerned about climate change and the numerous natural calamities that are caused by it. They feel it is useless trying to prevent it and the  best option is to live with it. I feel this attitude is absolutely unacceptable. Climate change is caused by humans and hence, it is our responsibility to take the necessary steps to prevent it. In this essay, I will discuss why I feel so, giving examples from my own knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, nature has a balance which ,unfortunately, over the last many years has been disrupted by human activities such as mining, deforestation, industrialization and so on. The main impact of climate change is a global rise in temperature or global warming. This has affected not only the quality of our lives but also the natural habitats and lives of all other living beings. For example, this phenomenon has caused the polar glaciers to melt thus leading to a rise in the sea level. The increased temperature has also negatively impacted the lives of the animals there. In 2021, this imbalance in the polar region resulted in a terrible snowstorm in a place called Austin in Texas which is thousands of miles away. There was unexpected snowfall for two days which affected the city so badly that most of the area went completely off the grid for more than two weeks. This also caused immense damage to the infrastructure of the city as well as property and financial damages to the residents there, not to mention the inconvenience. \r\n\r\nYet another disaster that is a consequence of climate change is the wildfires. These claim the lives of so many poor animals every year in different parts of the world. This is again an inevitable result of climate change. \r\n\r\nHence, to conclude, my point of view is that  climate change is caused by us and it is our responsibility to control it. We must not just think about ourselves but also about the future generations who deserve to live a quality life on this beautiful planet.",

Nowadays, many think that luck is a major trait to get succeed in one's goal. I completely deny this statement because hard work plays a crucial role to become a successful person in their life.\r\n\r\nIn this essay, I will briefly discuss my viewpoints in detail.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, achieving success is not merely come from a single aspect, it has a myriad of characteristics to work with. In that, hard work plays a key role. In addition, spending a plethora of hours in a particular work will boost the skill in that field. For instance, Neeraj Chopra won the gold medal in javelin throw in the Olympics, although he had been practiced for many years, still people call him as a lucky person. Thus, luck is not enough to achieve success, working hard and the amount of time spent is matters. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one can learn enormous things from failures. Indeed, doing mistakes is common for everyone but learning from that errors and correcting those is imperative. Moreover, One ought not to do the same mistakes in the next attempt as they did previously.

        "essay": "People have contrasting views, about the occurrences of children, whether parents or their offsprings should be penalized. In my opinion, the youngster should get penalties to have the realization; however, both views will be discussed.\r\n\r\nPunishing for misconduct is highly required for the children to develop their interpersonal skill. In this stage, humans have higher possibilities of performing some crimes, such as physically hurting others, bullying, smoking,  and lying. Hence, unless youngsters are not judged and receive punishments for mischiefs, it is highly likely that these activities will be inculcated in their characters. Consequently, they will exercise these repeatedly and go astray. But, penalties for crimes will create an ethical sense and fear in them, which will refrain them to perform these later in their life. For example, a survey driven by Wikipedia reveals that those kids are grown-up with good personalities who are forfeited for their bad offences.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, parents should be punished as their offsprings are mostly followers of them. They are the primary teacher of a newborn and naturally transcribed by their babies. As a result, many young individuals execute crimes because of having improper supervision of their family as well as by seeing that in their elders' nature. Therefore, ancestors should take responsibilities for their child's criminal activities and pays for that. Despite this, penalizing others instead of offenders will create almost no difference in young human's behaviour as they might not realize the effects; rather, sentencing young criminals will arouse their conscience and let them not to do so in future. For instance, introducing extra fees for delayed attendance in the class has reduced the number of late attendance in a school.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although according to some people elders should be judged for their offsprings' crime, I think kids should be regulated because it will provide them with consciousness and promote them to become a good person.",

In this essay, I will explain both sides and show my personal view. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are those who take a stance that it is unfair for the workers to earn smaller wages. This is because a company can only prosper with the hardwork of several employees who dedicate their lifes to their jobs. As a matter of fact, these people frequently work long hours until exhaustion, whilst the directors of the organizations have a flexible schedule. According to this view, it is a complete injustice that the ordinary workers are not as well-paid as their bosses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since company owners invest a high amount of money and dedication when they decide to run a business, it is reasonable that they earn much more than their employees. As an illustration of this, there are hundreds of entrepreneurs who spend countless years saving up money and learning the skills to build up an organization. Moreover, directors have a huge responsibility of coordinating the workforce which is an incredible difficult task. Therefore, the high salaries are compatible with the effort they have made to create and comand a corporation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though employees are a fundamental part of every company’s success, it seems to me that the directors are entitled to higher salaries as they have put a lot of effort and money into the business as well as they are responsible for entire the workforce.",

This phenomenon is caused by various reasons and it has stirred up many heated arguments on whether cosmetic surgery is a positive or negative trend. Personally, I see myself siding with the former.\r\n\r\nPeople’s recent preference for cosmetic surgery is said to stem from a number of factors. To begin with, the higher demand for plastic surgery is due to the fact that nowadays, people seem to care more about their physical appearance than ever before, as such, they develop a desire to look more attractive. Therefore, when this mindset is taken into consideration, it is not difficult to explain why there is a rapid growth in the number of people undertaking plastic operations. In addition, the incredible and meteoric development of technology in recent times further contributes to the widespread use of cosmetic procedures. The utilization of highly advanced machinery undoubtedly results in increased efficiency, quality, as well as safety, allowing patients to put more trust in the process.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, an individual's wish to become more beautiful is not something that should be criticized or ridiculed owning thank to the fact that\r\n\r\nan attractive and pleasing physical appearance can be greatly beneficial, such as remarkably boosting a person’s confidence and self-esteem, or improving one’s sense of happiness. Consequently, I am convinced cosmetic surgery is a viable method for those who want to refine their looks. Nevertheless, it is unwise to abuse plastic surgery, as overusing this method can lead to various health issues. When an individual undertakes a plethora of operations, an exceedingly large quantity of risks will become apparent, these consequences include blood loss, organ damage or even more horrifying, death.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in recent times, cosmetic surgery has greatly soared in popularity, mostly thanks to the fact people are becoming more and more conscious of their outward appearance.

        "prompt": "Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think it has a negative impact on sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Many corporations are sponsoring sporting events or teams as an efficient marketing tool. Some believe this trend exerts negative impacts on sports. I somewhat agree with this.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, sponsorship leads to a win-win situation for both the event and the corporation. Primarily, companies can provide financial support to competitors that desperately need money. The costs of holding and publicizing a sports event can be exorbitant, and a high-profile international game, such as World Cup, expects billions of dollars. Therefore, the financial aid subsidized by sponsors is essential to cover the venues, equipment, catering and other costly expenditures. In addition, it is a lucrative business for companies, because sponsoring popular teams and competitions can gain immense visibility, develop positive brand associations, and cultivate customer loyalty of certain die-hard sports fans.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there are valid reasons to say endorsements damage the events and athletes with their business nature in certain ways. Firstly, the sponsor can manipulate or even exploit the athletes, teams and events to suit their interests. For example, when Nike invested $160 million in a five-year sponsorship of the Brazil national football team, the company was allowed to specify where, when and against whom the national team would play. Secondly, some corporations associate sports with negative images. The cases in point are the alcohol and tobacco companies whose media coverage promotes highly addictive products that deteriorate public health. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, sponsorship has mutual benefits for both parties but over-commercialization will also bring about unwanted manipulation for sports properties and reputation risks if associated with controversial products. On balance, I propose that sports properties should always select their sponsors with caution and never compromise their inherent virtue for revenue.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. \r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for this?\r\n\r\nHow can people research this?",
        "essay": "It is becoming increasingly interesting for people to find out the background story of the house or building they reside in. The major reason behind this is curiosity about their residents. Some ways could be done to research the history, such as interviewing the local neighbourhoods, going to libraries or searching it online. \r\n\r\nThere are some motives for people to explore the past of the place where they live. Firstly, it is because curiosity is the nature of human beings. Therefore, they tend to wonder about the origin of something, including their residents. This exploration could be beneficial for  homeowners since they can gather information about their houses and the important histories behind them. As an example, in the Conjuring movie, the homeowner and the paranormal tried to find the history of the house in order to reveal the reasons behind the haunted experience that the homeowner experienced. By gathering the data, they could also find out about the old times of the building’s structure, whether it ever experienced a disaster or something else, so when they want to renovate it, they would take some precautionary measures to avoid the same things that happened before. \r\n\r\nThere are some kinds of activities that could help the owner to reveal the secrets of their residents. First, they can ask their neighbours about the house. It could be an effective way if the person that they interviewed has lived there for a long time. Additionally, local people are familiar with the surroundings. Therefore, they could give a specific story about the house. Secondly, the local library could be one of the options if the authority has good documentation about the area. To illustrate, the government of the Dutch East Indies has a good archive of Surabaya’s maps, which will give advantages in the research. Lastly, we could utilize the Internet. The internet provides a bunch of information that can be accessed by the public. For example, Google Maps has a feature to look back at the old maps in real view, which helps us to find out the chronicles. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, people like to discover the past stories of their buildings because they are curious about them. They could learn that information by asking the local community, reading some materials from the local libraries, or the Internet.",

        "essay": "Artificially intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workplace.  Although menial jobs may be taken over by robots however, creative jobs would still require human mind to be done. This essay will discuss why fewer jobs must require human interaction.\r\nSimple jobs that don’t require complex procedures will soon be replaced by artificially intelligent robots to perform them. Rather to invest in recruiting and training of human resource for routine tasks, it can smartly be performed by robots flawlessly. For example, in fast food restaurants, people can place order on automated machines with predefined instructions, which serve order within allocated time limit without any hassle. In addition to that they work round the clock without any holidays. For these reasons, simpler jobs performed by robots will completely be handed over to them.\r\nConversely, the jobs that require unique solutions would still require human mind to be completed. Robots will never be able to think and produce a unique ideas or solutions to potential requirements. For instance, the advertisement of newly developed product would require a creative strategy to distinguish it from existing products.  Rather than using an existing strategy of same category product.\r\nTo conclude, it is likely that significant number of jobs will be taken over by artificially intelligent robots. Menial jobs would entirely be the domain of robots; however, complex jobs that require unique solutions would still be performed by humans. Ultimately, few human jobs will be left due to increasingly artificially intelligent workforce.",

        "essay": "It’s true that some people believe that cross-national support is the most effective way to tackle with emergent issues in certain countries. From my perspective, i totally agree with this statement and i will discuss the reasons in the following essay.\r\n\r\nThere are some national problems which is urgent to deal with, such as famine in some undeveloped country. People there are encountered with an extreme scarcity of food, and the widespread malnutrition and death from starving. Most of the reasons comes from inevitable natural weakness, for instance, prolonged flooding, drought, extreme cold, insect infestation and plant disease which can’t be deal with country itself. Hence, in these cases, governments by no means should ask international aid from other developed nations which have major economics, conducive to gaining stable and enormous food source to distribute the dwellers and solve the hunger problems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, government should rely on international cooperation when they face unexpected catastrophes like earthquake, tsunamis, and tornado attack. Those kinds of emergency are overwhelming challenges which insist on international assistance. What’s more, the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened currently is also in count, the political issue which is too complicated to solve alone. The reconstruction plan for the country is needy for international support.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my view, it’s true that the international assistance is an effective way in dealing with many of acute problems instead of solving alone.",

However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "In this digital era, people always use the computer to assist their life, including education programs in school. It is so essential that most schools provide computers in the classrooms for their students. However, if the student is too dependent on computers, it will have two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.\r\nIf we go back twenty years, only a few schools already have computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that. In this case, a student who relies so much on computers may need more social skills, as the interaction between student and teacher will be less, that caused by the materials and exercises will be delivered online or by any application programs.\r\nDespite the risks, there are also several benefits that students can gain from computers. First, it will provide much positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned and exercises to be done anywhere and anytime. Besides that, a computer will assist the teacher when reviewing the student's homework.\r\nIn conclusion, the benefits of computer dependency in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. Eventually, students can study more anywhere and anytime, although there will be a risk related to social concern.",

        "essay": "It is widely known that there are many university graduates who are unable to work in their desired fields after they finish their studies. This essay will elucidate the causes behind this phenomenon and offer solutions to tackle the problems.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most common reason is the fact that fresh graduates usually do not have the technical skills that their chosen profession requires. Possessing technical knowledge is an essential factor that employers consider when assessing job applicants. Meanwhile, university students tend to focus more on theoretical aspects rather than practical sides. Furthermore, this circumstance is exacerbated by limited job availability due to  increasing competition in job markets. To cite an example, there are fewer jobs in government institutions than the number of students holding a degree in political science. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, there are certainly some steps that can be taken to face those challenges. Firstly, university students should take internship jobs prior to applying to full-time jobs. Having more exposure to the professional world, students can identify the practical skills they need in order to excel in those jobs. After completing internships, they can also consider finding jobs in different cities to increase the probability of finding their dream occupations. For instance, they can try to browse jobs in the top five largest cities in their country. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main rationales that hinder university graduates from getting their desired profession are twofold, they are the lack of technical abilities and the low number of job postings. University students can mitigate these by joining internship programs and expanding their job-searching efforts",

        "essay": "Compulsory education is one of the main concerns people have. Particularly, many doubt whether it is important to art, drama and music classes in the curriculum. While some people might argue on this topic, I personally believe that it is important to make such classes a part of every child’s education.\r\n\r\nThose, who say that such classes must be optional, also claim that children should be able to use one of their basic rights, that is, to speek freely. Taking into consideration a child’s opinion is critically necessary, if we wish they had a bright future. For that reason, children should be able to manifest what they want and know what duties they are going to have in return. So, it is preferably that children make a decision about classes in their school schedule on their own. Basically, people, belonging to this side, propose that children should decide what to study by their selves. In this case, children who want to learn art classes can pick them. However, if they do not want to study it, such children should be allowed to skip these classes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is an opinion that while children are small, they might not know what exactly is and will be important in their lives. Due to this fact, it is vital to provide children with a wide spectrum of knowledge and abilities. So that by the time they become adults, children will have already gained all skills to start a career in any field they want. So, art, drama and music classes must also be included in the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I stand for the second opinion and I believe that it is necessary to give children all the basic knowledge that is possible, including art, drama and music classes.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are different opinions concerning  this topic and there is truth in each of the sides.

        "essay": "Instruction of young individuals is highly emphasised in many nations. However, some communities believe that tutoring adults who do not have proficiency is even more vital, and governments should spend more funds on this. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the statement given, and I will elaborate on it in this essay.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, today, some nations have compulsory education so their youngsters can learn knowledge in school. Moreover, when they back to their home, their caregivers can assist them so they learn more. However, some families have inhospitable environments for children in which those people cannot learn reading and writing skills in their house. For example, if their mother or father is an alcoholic, they cannot teach their offspring and some use violence to heat their scions, so they feel afraid to learn everything. As a result, they do not have any bills, so we must spend funds on those young folks.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the majority of adults can get a job which can earn salaries, and it is not an illegal thing. But, in many countries, heirs cannot get a job because of the law. In addition, numerous youngsters are influenced by adults, so if they cannot receive cash from their government, they will lose their opportunity to learn literacy. For instance, in South Korea, many old communities cannot write or read because, when they were young individuals, South Korea was at war, so they could not learn literacy. But when they become adults, they can learn writing and reading skills. Therefore, we must protect children from those environments.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely disagree with this topic. Children who have bad guardians, cannot enough learn literacy. Conversely, many adults can learn those skills because they can get a job as well as pay. So, we should spend money on those young people because they are precious people in our lives.",

        "essay": "Over many decades, environmental matters have always been a controversial topic from all citizens around the world. Many people believe by uplifting the fossil fuel costs can reduce unnecessary journeys made by cars and other vehicles. Though I agree with this opinion, I hereby suggest some other feasible ways to improve the quality of the environment.\r\nAs we can see, national authorities play a vital role in environmental issues. By putting the rise in natural gas prices into action, car owners and motor drivers are likely to consume less and as a result, a reduction in transportation and any kinds of journeys running on roads will be made. Meanwhile, national authorities should warn people about the unfortunate accidents along with negative effects caused by private cars and other vehicles, so that they can encourage and enhance the use of public transportation. Secondly, from the viewpoint of freight services, they ought to find an alternative way to deliver the merchandise in case the official regulation on the gas price would have been made. Both these measures would cut down on emissions from vehicles, aid to alleviate the greenhouse effect and recover the fresh air quality.\r\n\r\nContrary to the temporary solution to fuel prices, some other potential measures can be added up to tackle environmental issues. The government can introduce some transport policies to control the upcoming number of private car ownership. For example, recently, Vietnam has imposed some new regulations to strictly control the driving test. Besides public transportation, the government can support more environmentally friendly transports like using electric motorbikes, bicycles, and scooters. As for the capital of Netherlands, Amsterdam is considered one of the most famous destinations for its cycling culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I consider increasing the fuel price is one method of controlling gas emissions. Despite the government accountable, people inevitably must lend a helping hand to solve the problem together and for the benefit of our future generations as well as the well-being of the existing community.",

Youngsters are increasingly having challenges with curriculum in their citadels of learning. This essay will outline the major factors why this is a constraint and suggest ways to curb the menace.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, high exposure to modernized games is a significant reason why children who are clouded with play can no longer strive maximally with regard to their educational sessions. This is due to the fact that most parents are working busy jobs,thus, leaving their offspring at the mercy of uncontrolled social media and time management Consequently, this leads to poor outcomes and exam failures. For example, studies published by the Ministry of Education, Lagos, Nigeria, showed that children who finish their assignments immediately after the afternoon meal perform excellently than those who leave theirs till the following class because they usually do not have a quick grasp of the topic being discussed. The above informs that passive parenting that avails children the opportunity to access electronic games disrupts the learning curve of young ones.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, monitored child upbringing is vital to promote study patterns and education. This is owing to the fact that proper tutelage and monitoring instils discipline and enhance learning goals for young minds. As a result, there is an improved academic performance among students. For instance, a personal encounter I observed is of my niece who developed an increased rate of curricular activities after her mother returned home early to help out with homework. To put it together, the personal grooming of little ones by parents and guardians promotes assimilation due to a simplified explanation and an improved learning culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are various reservations about the causes of this trend among schoolers, i believe that detailed lectures, reduction of play time or gadgets as well as mentoring by the right persons can tackle these issues.",

Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.\r\nTo sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the houses or building they live in.\r\nWhat is the reason for this?\r\nHow can people research on this?",
        "essay": "A growing number of people have realized that it is of interest to discover the history's about the dwelling or building where they live. This is because many people would like to know the value of their housing as well as connect with their neighbours. In my opinion, local libraries will greatly contribute to looking into it because they preserve a massive number of materials that are related to the area. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, one of the reasons for this movement is that people would like to know about the value of their dwelling. In general, the long history the house has, the higher its value is. It is crucial to know the exact price of the house since housing is usually considered one of the properties. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this reason, people want to build a new connection by acquiring the past of the house.  Throughout the research, people can establish new relationships with their neighbours. To give an illustration, during the research, people may have many chances to communicate with their neighbours, which can make a bridge between them. \r\n\r\nIn order to grasp the history of the house, the local libraries can be useful. This is because, unlike city libraries, many local libraries exhibit not only books but also documents that are handed down by the previous generation. In short, the local libraries are supposed to exhibit the layout of the town and the scheme of the development of the town, which may help you identify the exact age of the house as well as its first owner. As a result, these written record enables you to understand the past of the house. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many communities hope to know the past of the house because they would like to know not only the value of the house but also build a new bond between neighbours.  To obtain the house's history, in my point of view, the local libraries are helpful since they keep the written materials that are related to the region.",

Some people suggest that global warming should be combated, whereas others think people should accept the current fact and adapt to changes. In the following paragraphs, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before a conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\nMany activists around the world try to urge people to stop behaviours that cause the greenhouse effect. Many people contribute to find strategies to mitigate climate change; however, this is unable to be successful without governments’ support ; therefore, governments need to deliver effective climate policies such as carbon footprint reduction, clean energy, sustainable lifestyle and so on to all organisations, factories and individuals to be able to follow them in order to prevent the increase of the worse situations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people think that climate change is acceptable and people should be adaptable to all kinds of situations. In the last few decades, there were different natural disasters happened in different parts of the world such as floods, sea-level rise, the melting of the polar ice sheet, droughts, extreme weather and earthquake which are the effects of global warming that cannot be avoided to encounter in some countries.

Some people feel that to overcome this issue we need to give better learning to offenders however others feel that  prison is the only solution for this problem.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, a better Education can be helpful to get  rid of the criminal mind. Firstly, the root for most of the lawbreakers is poverty and a well-educated person can get a job. These jobs will be a source of income for their families which means now they can earn legally which will eventually reduce the numbers of  criminals. For example, in India minor criminals are sent to juvenile custody where they can complete their studies, which help them to have a better future and the rate of minor offenders have been going down.\r\n\r\nSecondly, most of the people who commit crime are not aware of the consequences.

        "essay": "Nowadays, we often see our mailbox flooded with lots of advertisements from multiple organisations promoting their products and I believe that these attractive ads certainly creates an urge to buy the articles. Firstly, we will discuss the impact of this on our buying pattern and secondly, we will elaborate on the ways to safeguard the consumers.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, media advertising has become a billion-dollar industry, also, it is tremendously boosting the topline of various large corporates. Furthermore, various agencies target the audience based on  emotional grounds. It takes months of hard work to prepare a visual of 30 seconds, which directly targets the heart as well as the brain of the customer. For example, I recently shopped from Tanishq rather than a local store, as I received a fascinating brochure in yesterday's newspaper. Thus, it is evident that it is human behaviour to easily get influenced by something that blew our minds.     \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a large number of brands often try to show positives only, whereas, they always try to hide the negative impacts of their products. For instance, Nestle never mentioned in their advertisements  the presence of lead in their famous product \"Maggy\", which was banned later. Therefore, the concerned authorities need to propose some stringent rules along with, to impose hefty penalties over misrepresentation of facts, which surely can save the consumers from being cheated.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is true that displays play a big role in affecting our decisions and in loosening our pockets, but rulers must approve every pictorial representation only after it satisfies all the required criteria and cancels the license of the corporates not adhering to the guidelines.",

While it has plenty of benefits such as possibility of finding like-minded people, who share your interests, and receiving news in real-time, we should take into account some drawbacks such as scrolling addiction and fake news.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the social network is a great place to meet new friends with shared hobbies, which might be hard to do in offline life. You can join a community that is built around any activity that you are interested in. For example, I have recently joined a gluten-free backing community where I met nice people from different countries who shared their recipes and experiences. Furthermore, online media provide you with convenient way to get news almost immediately as data is shared live.\r\n\r\nContrarily, overusing social media can lead to unfavourable consequences such as scrolling addiction, depression, or anxiety. Continued checking of the news feed can be dangerous for mental health, as has been well-established in the scientific literature, individuals may develop addiction to get information online, which results in a lack of concentration and a depressed state in real life, which is not that colourful. Moreover, reading news only from social media can be harmful, as it does not get through the appoval and deep fact-checking and, in many cases, can be fake. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, social media has become an important part of our lives that serves us to be in touch with close ones and receive actual information.

        "essay": "In this day and age, more and more people believe that it is essential for the government to use stricter penalties in order to reduce the large number of accidents and protect the safety of drivers. From my perspective, I partly agree with this phenomenon as I suppose that there are better ways to address these transportation-related issues.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are many reasons why imposing stricter punishments for criminal driving is extremely important. More and more people using personal vehicles violate the law such as running red lights, speeding or driving drunk, leading to thousands of casualties every year. Thus, strict punishment plays an important role in improving many adverse problems related to traffic accidents. These disciplines, such as paying a heavy fine or banning them from driving for a period of time, can instill fear and discourage lawbreakers from driving again. For example, if a driver violates traffic laws, he will be given a heavy fine to remind him that he should not do it again.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government should combine stricter laws with other effective measures to promote better driving habits. One suggestion is to launch campaigns related to education about proper driving behavior and the consequences of committing driving offenses in order to raise people's awareness. Another approach is to increase the legal driving age of young people, which means that they will have more time to sharpen their driving skills. Thus, the combination of these methods can create more desired results than relying on only one. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, not only severe punishment for driving offences but also other measures contribute to heightening people's awareness and improving road safety.",

It is such an exciting idea but I feel that you need to consider more about the advantages and disadvantages before you go. \r\n\r\nAs you and I are probably aware , the space-travelling industry is a whole new industry and a new industry means more jobs for people. In this way, by participating in space travels, you are helping to create a new job market that can help more people here on earth. \r\n\r\nAnother thing about space travel is that it allows you to get a new perspective on Earth: the perspective from above that you have never experienced before.

Since this is a serious problem all people will be equally affected, including you and me. \r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, space-travelling also has its disadvantages.

To elaborate , if the younger population increases it will lead to economic growth in a nation. It is obvious that the outsourcing of foreign companies from various regions will become more interested  to open new branches in the country to acquire more talented and creative employees so that they can enhance the productivity of the corporates.

        "essay": "Nowadays, looks have become more crucial than any other aspect of one’s life and therefore people are splurging large sums of dollars on cosmetic surgeries and focusing on gaining popularity. This advancement has had negative consequences and the reasons for the same are highlighted in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nWith the advancement in medical sciences, cosmetology procedures have gained significant popularity in today’s world resulting in attracting huge crowds. Additionally, influential personalities such as popular actors and artists are normalizing this trend by enhancing their on-screen appearances and giving a youthful appeal to their admirers. To illustrate further, a survey has been conducted by United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization, indicating 65 per cent of the adults are willing to opt for treatments that make them appear younger. \r\n\r\nNext, due to the adoption of western culture, people are drifting away from their traditions. Additionally, fame and materialistic gains have become the symbol of success for many pupils that they believe will be lost if they do not keep their outlook enhanced resulting in the wastage of financial resources. To exemplify, huge spending is being normalized by actresses to get younger-looking perfect skin and features in order to gain continuous work in films and television thus inculcating an inferiority complex in the middle age women around the globe.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, instead of opting for artificial alternatives, one should resort to natural ways of maintaining their body and mind.

Because of climate change, the average temperature of the earth has been rising over the years and this is leading to problems such as droughts and forest fires.

The first one is that I think that getting richer, even if the person is already rich, will probably make the person feel better, and the second one is that I do not agree with generalizing people’s feelings.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we cannot deny that improving the economy in a rich country would contribute to the better well-being of people, increasing their life quality standards. One example of this is Finlandia, this country is one of the happiest nations in the world and its wealth index is enormous. People have time to dedicate to their families instead of working all day and children attend school only for three hours, having the best education system with the highest educational standards. All this contributes to an improvement of the national economy, making feel its citizens happier as their work-life balance gets better. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I think that the majority of citizens may be happier in case of economic improvement. However, not everything in life is about the economy, and I think that this may be related to why some people are not feeling better with this “good news”. Nowadays, individuals are very confused about life, and even if they are wealthy, money cannot resolve what a person feels or desires. Statistics show the highest suicide rates in the richest countries, which proves that being economically stable and rich does not guarantee happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even if some experts believe that an additional increase in the economy in a rich country would not make a difference among their citizens, I think that it would definitely contribute to the better well-being of most people increasing their quality of life standards and satisfaction levels. However, some sectors of society may be experiencing other issues in their lives that do not let them pain attention to other good things, like feeling happier because their country and their people are acceding to a better lifestyle standard.

According to me there are ample of reasons responsible for this attitude, in this essay I will be discussing few of them along with the issues it can give rise to.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary factor could be the easy availability of items. Nowadays, people have flexible access to shopping such as online with lots of variety to choose in terms of price and quality. For instance, China has made almost everything at a cheaper cost which were previously available only in branded labels. Moreover, the repairing cost is some times higher than to replace. Secondly, while some people are nowadays quite lazy to visit repairing centers others might me too occupied to get it done. Nevertheless, they find throwing away and buying a new one to be more convenient. Lastly, the newer generation does not have much emotional attachment with the materialistic things as compared to the past when people used to preserve things or valuables to pass it on to next generations.\r\n\r\nThere can be some issues related to this as, firstly, in order to meet the demands of people the raw materials are used excessively leading to nature imbalance. For example, water reservoir is getting depleted used in manufacturing goods. In addition to this, the use and throw policy is creating huge waste which gets accumulated as land fills. Furthermore, majority of population is losing the importance of reusable  or recyclable goods as everything is so easily available. For example, mobile phones are now so conveniently accessible that it is more complicated and expensive to get them repaired.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, development in today's world is the leading factor attributed to this whereas in past people use to travel miles to get some goods.Technology has brought great revolution in people's thinking process and lifestyle.

There are several reasons to this issue including the use of non-biodegradable materials in its packaging and the emissions from manufacturing process. There are some actions that can be implemented to solve this issue. \r\n\r\nThe increase in production of consumer goods that can harm the environment is caused by two factors, the using of harmful materials both in packaging and production process. Some companies have used the materials which cannot be recycled for the future used such as plastics. As more products are fabricated, more wastes are generated. Moreover, to produce their products, they still use some machines powered by fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is produced when fossil fuels are used, and its emission can lead to pollution. \r\n\r\nThere are some potential solutions to resolve this problem. Firstly, the government should ensure that companies use eco-friendly materials for all their kits. For example, in many companies such as McDonalds and Starbucks have used the paper box and the straw which made from bamboo. Secondly, the increasing of emissions could be reduced by giving lower price to the companies to use a renewable energy in their manufacturing process. As a result, the companies would be attracted to use the safer sources to create their products.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are two main reasons why the environment experienced a damage from the production of goods.

When the cost of fuel is low people tend to purchase more vehicles as their maintenance cost is lower. This can indirectly increase the traffic jam and subsequently elevates  environmental pollution. For example, in countries with low oil prices, the annual sales of automobiles also considerably high. Therefore, by increasing the prices of fossil fuel, consumption will also be reduced and it will indirectly support the environment\r\n\r\nHowever, the elevation of the prices of fossil fuel is not the only answer for the environmental crisis but there are many more logical solutions for this. For instances, the production of  electrically-driven automobiles, as well as reduction of the import of petrol and diesel vehicles can be considered.

Furthermore, learners may receive an incredible amount of resources and information on the Internet that needs for their academic work. Another thing is that, online learning also empowers students have freedom of choices over diverse disciplines from science to economic. Many renowned universities, such as Havard, create a number of online courses which are free of charge for everyone wish to pursue higher education. As a result, it can facilitate their learning process and improve their independent learning skills.\r\nOn the other hand, virtual classrooms are poor substitutes for conventional classes as do not require regular face-to-face interaction between students and teachers. Consequently, they might fail to receive a comprehensive understanding because when they hand-in their essay online, they could rarely consult a teacher for improving their weakened skills. Moreover, students are easily distracted from the Internet while participating in online lessons. This also contributes to lower studying outcome because they tend to lose concentration during taking part in e-learning.\r\nIn conclusion, although virtual learning can be beneficial in several ways, I believe that this studying may not completely substitute for tradition classes.",

        "prompt": "One of the consequences of improved technology is that many jobs that used to be done by people can now be complete by robots or computers. Do you think the advantages of this development outweighs the disadvantages?",
        "essay": "In the recent era, technological enhancement has led to an evolution of artificial robots and computers, which have replaced most of the jobs which was earlier done by humans. Using latest computer technology, there are many advantages which makes tedious manual work a lot easier. Though there are many positives, there are some drawbacks too. This essay will tell you why the benefits of this technological development overcomes the disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobots and computers have many advantages which have simplified many human jobs due to various factors. Use of machinery not only saves time but also money. For example, in the olden days people used to manually write a business letter which needed to be sent through the post and it would take several days to get delivered. Invention of email in the late 90's has certainly solved this problem. Now it is much easier to send a business email with minimal cost which has enhanced business profits.Another example we can consider of Online shopping which is far more convenient than Traditional shopping. Varieties of options can be explored and chosen which includes free delivery too. Certainly improved machinery has lots of positives which are useful for the development of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough automation has helped humans in various fields, there are some negatives which also needs to be considered. With the introduction of computers in office, many unskilled labour lost their jobs and percentage of unemployment increased rapidly. Human health has also become a primary concern since people sit long hours in front of television with very little or no exercise at all. Even though computers and robots have improved human lives, it has also impacted them in a negative way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, improved technology has certainly eased a lot of hardcore manual tasks with the introduction of automated household machines and technological gadgets. Though It has added many benefits to our life, it is also responsible for some the problems which we are suffering today. If we can improvise the limitations of these advancements, we can certainly unleash and attain greater heights for human development. As per my opinion, advantages of improved technology will certainly outweigh the disadvantages.",

        "prompt": "Some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your own opinion",
        "essay": "There is no doubt that these days countries are increasing their trade and cultural connections. Some believe that it is a positive thing while others disagree with this idea. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and I will share my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of advantages, countries opening up to each other has many benefits. First, it made people understand and care for each other more. To illustrate, many recent reports showed an increase in tolerance among people in open societies. Secondly, multiple goods are now freely traded between the east and the west. This made those goods cheaper in price and more affordable. Gadgets and technology innovations spread immediately to be used all over the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while increasing connections between counties have its benefits, it also carries its own downsides. It turned the world into a global village. people can hardly differentiate between cities since most of them almost look and feel the same. In other words, travelling has lost most of its appeal. On top of that, small local businesses could not compete with large factories that are producing in China. Many of them could not maintain their businesses and had to close. In the long term, this is damaging to local economies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although increasing cultural contact and opening up trade between countries is beneficial, it has its side effects. I believe that it is useful to increase business contact with some limits. I also believe that culture should be unique to each country and should be protected.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, people are having children at later age in life. What are the reasons? Do the advantage outweigh disadvantages?",
        "essay": "Due various shifts in social value and economic condition, many couples in this day and age decide to have children at a later age compared to the last generation. This essay will explore some of the reaonse behind this trend.\r\n\r\nThe biggest reason of delayed childbearing is that the cost of raising children nowadays, especially in big cities, is becoming exorbitant and many of young couples choose to live in these expensive area because of job prospect. Therefore, they often have no choice but to delay their plan of procreation until they are financially stable enough to raise a child. Moreover, instead of satisfying for being a housewife, a woman of the current generation often has an aspiring career. It is often the case that woman with a strong career mind do not want to be distracted by parenting, which requires a huge amount of attention and effort. \r\n\r\nIn addition, contraceptive methods have become far more robust and the cost of them came down a lot due to the advancement of the manufacturing process in the decades. As a result, the use of contraceptive tools became prevalent among couples and young couples who have regular sexual activity can mostly avoid unwanted child birth.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, It is true that late childbearing can have some drawbacks. The biggest one being the increase of medical risk to the woman and the baby. However, such risk can mostly remedy with modem technology. On the other hand, there are multiple advantage of having children later in life. For one thing, these parents usually have a more robust financial base, therefore, can provide their children a better quality of life and most importantly education. For another thing, it is apparent that people of older age are more mature and less likely to make mistakes in deciding their children's future. As a result, they would be much more suitable parents, compared to their younger self.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the main cause for late childbearing of this generation is economic difficulties and the urgency to become successful in one's career. Modern contraceptive methods also play a minor role in helping young couples to prevent unwanted births. While late childbearing can cause some medical problem in pregnancy, overall, I believe the benefits of a more mature parenthood outbalance the potential downsides.",

        "essay": "Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.",

        "essay": "It is true that a growing number of people are giving a lot of attention to what happened in the past to the accommodation they live in. There are some factors which help to account for this trend and people today have a number of options when researching facts about their buildings' past.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, people are becoming more curious about the history of their houses and even other accommodations. I have several theories as to why this is happening. Firstly, if people work out the real value that their properties hold, they can become more pleasant to live in. To clarify, some houses have had a variety of records and recollections for a long time, which possibly could enhance the value of the building. For instance, one of these fairly old houses in the US was revealed to be the one Stevie Wonder used to live in when he was young and it was sold for triple the price that the owner paid for it before he knew the fact. Secondly, it is crucial to detect whether the condo has the history of a shack. If it was built a long time ago with inappropriate materials used in those days, renovation and maintenance would be essential. For example, it is said that the usable time of a house or building could be less than 50 years and after that it must be restored or demolished.\r\n\r\nIn terms of ways to find out the history, the most useful way is by using the Internet. Thanks to the advancements in technology, people can have access to a large volume of information. In fact, searching for incidents that happened around where a building stands is very straightforward. If, however, the private flat is located in a local community then asking around local residents would be an efficient way to disseminate lots of information about the land. Having lived there for a long time, they often have substantial knowledge about the history of the house. It is even possible that rumours exist about such properties which can be confirmed or denied by those residents. This kind of information can help people decide whether to take the house or not.\r\n\r\nIn summary conducting due diligence on the history of a property has many effects on where people decide to live. In some special cases, research such as this can lead to financial gain as well as avoiding any possible complications related to its history. Furthermore, using effective measurements to look it up is also important.",

In this day and age, the ever-increasing demand of people for lands to live and wood to consume, for means of industrial, agricultural and residential purposes, is the main drive to habitat destruction of flora and fauna. For example, the indiscriminate destruction of forest-based land in China pushes many categories of rare animals, especially pandas to the brink of extinction. Thus, the environment of plants and animals is indiscriminately abolished and lost completely instead of being replaced, which is the main reason people think it’s too late to deal with this alarming issue.\r\n\r\nWhile the consequences of human actions leading to  habitat destruction are widely acknowledged, there is an eclectic mix of methods to enhance this dire matter.

While there are some merits to support that idea, I would argue that pursuing further education is the best way to become successful.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the option to get a job has some certain benefits. To begin with, people are more likely to be financially independent since they could earn the money soon and help their family cover some expenses to reduce the family's financial burden. On top of that, they also have chances to gain more real-world experience sooner than other their peers and they would bring it into practice with the aim of getting a competitive salary in the future.

By way of illustration, my uncle took his whole life to learn to become a distinguished doctor, 7 years to get a bachelor degree, and a host of following years to get Master and PhD qualifications in America.

I agree with the statement that gardens and public squares are crucial part in all cities.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are numerous benefits for having green parks and squares in developing cities. Breathing fresh air plays vital role for all the citizens, to reduce the air by planting more trees and construction of parks are must in all cities. Moreover, the air is getting polluted due to more construction of industries due to this large extent of gas is released which is harmful for residents living in those areas. Another reason as more production of vehicle which results more usage of it by which unnecessarily air is getting polluted which disturbs the environment so having greenery and huge public spaces would be useful. For example, In India, the state named Delhi is known as world’s most populated because in the past an incident occurred about the flats which got destroyed due to some reasons and leads to some airborne particles in the air till today.\r\n\r\nOn other hand, employees who have to be consistent to their work by completing task before deadline and compete to their rivalry companies which creates cut-throat competition among them leads to more stress, pressure as hectic days by spending more hours on their work so to relax and have some leisure time, unwind their stress maximum gardens should be added in particular towns or cities.

Since, younglings learn via observation of otheres, it is rather intuitive that the content of these programmes could either affect positively or negatively. Due to the fact that there are lots of inappropriate shows as well as plethora of educational ones, as parents, it is crucial to supervise the time spent on television.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many argue that the time spent watching TV, is way more important.

In my view, this can be dangerous as it encourages us to spend without thinking and young people, in particular, need some protection from it.\r\n\r\nThe first point to make is that advertising does make us spend money we do not need to. There are nowadays so many different ways companies promote their products and services, ranging from television commercials to simple flyers that we cannot escape  it.   If,  for example, you watch a football match on television, you will see the logos of the tournament sponsors. Likewise, if you watch the latest blockbuster movie, very probably you will see a product placed in the film by some advertising agency. The volume of this advertising means that we, as consumers, tend to be profoundly influenced by it and buy without thinking.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to decide how to regulate advertising. Clearly, governments ought to restrict advertisements for harmful products such as alcohol and tobacco. They do not have the power, however, to control other forms of advertising. This means we need to use our common sense when we go to the shops, and ask ourselves whether we really need to\r\n\r\nmake that purchase. Parents should, however, ensure that young people are protected from too much exposure to advertising. This can mean simply explaining that it is not in fact necessary to buy the newest Xbox, or simply turning the television off.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that while we cannot escape advertising or its effects in the modern world, children should be encouraged not to pay too much attention to it",

        "prompt": "The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this?. What can be done to solve this problem?.",
        "essay": "The development of consumer products leads to the consequences of destroying the natural environment. This essay will outline the highlighted reasons related to this problem, then suggest suitable measures.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several reasons resulting in damage to the natural ecosystem due to the rise of consumer products. First of all, most people tend to use one only stuff on a daily basis because of their convenience function, especially  products made of plastic such as bags or cans. These types of habits completely harm the environment including indirect and direct ways. That means consumers who contribute to manufacturing large-scale products have a seriously long life-span. However, these are often used in the short term and thrown away in the environment that might not only waste, but also be eaten by wild animals. Addition, these goods are usually hard to biodegradable. A variety of reasons has been listed that could prove the cause of this issue is extremely huge and have serious outcomes in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to solve the problem of damaging the ecosystem resulting from the production of shopper goods. Firstly, the solution is appealing to consumers cutting down their products daily instead of applying the items that are environmentally-friendly. For example, in the modern age, there are favourite green goods, not only recycled things such as tote, bottles, glass or clothes, but also the appliance made from nature could be named baboo straw, banana leaf box. Beside that, the fevertly measure should be applied is the policies which can impose heavy tax for the goods being harmful for the natural environment, by contrast; tax-breaker for the items manufactured from eco-friendlier materials. Therefore, it can be said that the solutions provided should affect the consumers and the firm or business to create living conditions can demand not have negative impacts on the environment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the production of consumer goods can completely harm the natural environment such as the large number of these kinds of products that have been manufactured. To solve this issue, the measures not only impact on the consumer’ perspective about the goods they use in daily life, but also on the business making the products to encourage them to create more items that are friendly with the environment.",

Uses of technology have some benefits as well as there are some draw backs.

Everyone is depending on technology and they prefer to bring appliances to their homes. Because of machines are less time consuming and it gives comfortable life. For example, we can wash a bucket of clothes at a time by using of washing machine.

Through getting to know architectures in local, ancient people built houses mostly due to local environment. For example, Eskimos live in the Arctic region. Their traditional buildings are snow houses. That is because they could not use wood to build houses in the snow.On other hand, understanding history a lot for buildings can make residents generate a sense of belonging. To be specific, people can find many stories such as legends or real stories when they researched the history.The appealing stories can deeply impress people and touch them to live in location. \r\n\r\nIn regards to the means for helping civil to learn about local architectures can visit local museums of Old Buildings. These museum can introduce the evolution of local architectures to visitors. Take an museum of old building in Gulangyu island as an example, in Xiamen province, local historic buildings are turned into a museum. At the island, people can see fujian traditional accommodation, European architecture and so on. Different architecture styles eventually formed Xiamen building styles. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons behind the phenomenon are expecting to learn about local history and make residents have a sense of belonging.

        "essay": "Community service is a great deed and some people think that no wage community work if done by adolescents in their spare time can be fruitful for not only the community but themselves too. However, I do not fully agree with the above statement and this essay will discuss the reasons below.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no doubt about the benefits of doing community work regardless of the pay as doing something for society will always be returned manifolds. For example, when we take care of the elderly, they often bless us for our future endeavours and also share their invaluable life experience which can help an individual in tackling similar situations if they arise. Moreover, teenagers meet all sorts of people while working for this noble cause and can increase their network as well as learn to deal with real problems. This will result in their personal growth tremendously as well as help them grow in their professional life.\r\n\r\nSo it is undeniable that community work will make a society more prosperous and stable as there will be less problems to tend to. Be that as it may, getting paid for this service is a different issue. Sometimes , teenagers can lose interest in things which do not give tangible rewards. Therefore, giving a wage, even if it is small, will definitely attract more people towards community service. Moreover, they will do their work even more efficiently because of the lure of pay.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think if a teenager volunteers community service without considering the wage, it is great on his part but giving payment will help them stay motivated for this job so I do not fully agree with the given statement.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, there are many students who are at university or college find difficult to learn than when they studied at school. This essay will explore some reasons behind this phenomenon befor suggesting some solutions to tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nThere are several reasons that make students find harder when studying at university or college. Firstly, the transition to higher level education is difficult for students to follow. The curriculum at university or college requires more concentration and self-study than which they studied at school. The reason is given that when they studied at school, their old teachers might give them different examples and exercises in each lessons. Thanks to that, student when studied at school could understand the knowledge more effectively and easier. In contrast, when they continue to study at university or college, most of students have to look up information about the lecture in the Internet or in specialized books by themselves to do complex reseach projects with minimal guidance from their teachers. Secondly, students are often facing up with many classes with large number of students. These classes can make some students find harder to connect with their professors. As the result, the individualized support may decrease. This is also very different from what they received from their old teachers at school. Due to the smaller class size, old teachers could focus on all students, so they could know each student's weaknesses and strengths to help them improve their strengths and fix their weaknesses. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, students should be more proactive in their leaning processes. For example, when the students have questions about the lecture, they should meet their professors to ask them their questions after the class ended. Most of professors may spend little of their time to answer student's questions. By this way, many students can understand deeper about the lecture. Moreover, universities and colleges should divide classes into different smaller classes. Thanks to this solution, professors can focus more on their students and enhance the quality of the lecture. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the transition from school to university or college can bring several challenges for many students due to the requirement of concentration and self-study and the lack of individualized support. However, by the proactive of students and smaller classes can solve these issues.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, children are paying less attention to school than before. There are various reasons behind this such as hard curriculum, harsh schedule and mischievous behaviour. In this essay, I will explain these causes in more detail and try to offer some effective solutions to at least alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that little one’s are showing less interest in the school curriculum. The very first cause is the hard and strict curriculum. For example, one school term is comprised of various scientific, technological and mathematical programs. There seems no space for the other courses like painting, art, physical and game period. Ultimately, every day’s similar yet technical practice turn young ones to show less enthusiasm compared to the very first day of school excitement. Secondly, today teenagers are following stringent time schedules. For example, with a fully packed timetable of tutorial classes and activities, all they left is just time for sleep. Making them have very little space for the little one to do exactly what he wants. Thirdly, the mischievous nature of children forces them to participate in play activities than follow the schedule that they are really not a fan of. They prefer to have more fun and hilarious moments due to the fact that this is what  childhood is meant to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are various solutions for all the reasons enlisted above. Firstly, the need is to change the school timetable. The whole term should be comprised of games and art courses including all other scientific and mathematical approaches. This would at least break a monotonic routine of theory-based practices and provide some effective and efficient activities. Secondly, schools and parents can organize small tours to museums, zoos and science so as to increase young one’s interest in history, living species and scientific patterns. This would also increase and fulfil their curiosity to find fun while learning.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, although this has become a necessity that children should have an interest and knowledge of the whole globe and its scientific routines, this could only be accomplished by providing a combination of his and world interest routines together. This will increase their interest together with a heterogeneous environment.",

        "essay": "One of typical matters of concern these days is the notion of housing shortage. Although it has been argued that only the government can resolve this problem for citizens, I totally disagree with this view for many reasons.\r\nIt is clear that private real estate corporations are also a necessary driving force behind the supply of more housing. In particular, since these businesses are smaller and more active than state owns enterprises in their operation, they tend to meet housing demands faster and even more effectively. For example, in some developed countries, the middle class who are always in demanding property needs can be better catered for companies with greater customer services as well as professional teams to build luxury buildings. This contributes to an increase in the public assumption which fosters economic development.\r\nOn top of that, individuals can take steps to mitigate this issue by living in the suburbs and using public transportation. To be more specific, given the relocation of factories to rural areas, workers are likely to rent house near their workplaces. As a result, there would be a plunge in the population density, which alleviates the lack of accommodation in urban areas.\r\nHowever, it is plausible that the government plays an important role in the social security system. What the authorities bring to the society is to provide the social housing with the financial package. For instance, Hanoi has built thousands of low-priced apartments for residents with low income, such as single parents, the elderly and other disadvantaged people. By doing so, they could be able to purchase private properties.\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that inadequate housing can be best solved when governments, companies and individuals work together to fulfil demands raised by the inhabitants.",

Opposite to this if they intent a kids soon after a marriage than they have to be ready for the responsibilities of a baby coming to the world and have to be more careful and take care.\r\n\r\nWhereas if your intention of a child in your old age, say after 45, it would be problematic, especially for the women, as chances of getting pregnant are very less. Also in India, parents have to make sure that their baby should be well set while they are in the world and hence if you plan a juvenile in dotage, maybe at your retirement or in your old age, your toddler could be pursued in 12th or collage.\r\nSo it's advisable to have kids after 2 to 3 years of merger is a good decision.",

Actual cases and problems are the best teachers especially, for a junior person who wants to enrol. To make it clear let me continue with an example. Imagine a situation where you face a communication problem with a business team and your issue is how to get answers to your requests. You can back to your books and search for various methods to communicate with humans and then try each of them to get the result. But what is the best solution in that place? It is better if you have several experiences about this issue at work and as a result of that, you know how to have particular behaviours with diverse communities. According to that example, I believe that having Empirical knowledge is  key  in the business world. In addition to that, there are a lot of benefits in meet different experts in your field. You can learn a lot from them.\r\n\r\nSo moving on and talking about the other side, undoubtedly, there is a huge sea of differences between educated people and not educated ones. A lot of changes will happen to a man or woman in the education process about both his or her sides. They have changes in their characters and their behaviour besides  becoming a knowledgeable human. To clarify and as evidence, you can compare two people around you that have or do not have an educational background and think about their treatment with other people. Besides, these certainly, you can not ignore the impacts and needs of a base of academic and well-researched theories and facts to make you able to start a job as an expert. You need a starting point and education gives you the best one.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, probably the best approach is to care about both sides and reinforce each of them at their time to use their pros for any situation.

In my opinion, it is better for museums to reconcile two factors described above.\r\nOn the one hand, it cannot be denied that entertainment plays an indispensable role in museums recently. Firstly, museum can be seen as a tourist attraction in which people find their pleasure from savouring fascinating collection of exhibits. In other words, almost of people take a visit at museums to enjoy myself instead of getting academic knowledge. Secondly, integrating amusement into traditional exhibitions makes it easier for museums attract people’s attention, especially the younger generation. Finally, visitors who come to museums to seek entertainment may find themselves learning more than their expectation. \r\nOn the other hand, educating people is also an internal part of a museum. Museum provides the valuable information about history, culture or science to visitors via a variety of ways. The commentaries and storytelling, for instance, always give participants the knowledge that they have never known before. Additionally, tangible objects and collections that can be genuinely seen and touched make museum to be an ideal place for people to study as it offers people the precise views about history and other aspects. It is obvious that without museum it is very difficult for people to find other places that have the same learning advantages. \r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that museums should combine education and entertainment instead of splitting them into two separate parts.",

Whilst the main factor that has encouraged their significant effect is their ability to reach the overwhelming majority of citizens' homes, I believe that this has positively influenced civilians' notions. In this essay, the main reasons behind this trend, along with its advantageous points will be further elaborated. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n              To embark on, despite the fact that papers are endangered because of new means of publicities, the factor that has encouraged them to be highly influential is  their ubiquity in a substantial proportion of homes. This means that when journals become accessible to the majority of countrymen, their influence will be excessively profound. An eminent example of this is the Egyptian famous newsletters Al Ahram which is considered to be the main road towards Egyptians' thoughts and opinions. Therefore, the impact of journals on people's notions has not changed over the ages. \r\n\r\n        Furthermore, this phenomenon has a positive impact on nations' way of thinking because they are reliable and trusted. In other words, if youth read any news published in these authentic journals, they will believe that this information is trusted and take it for granted. This can be witnessed by the publicity campaign which was conducted by the famous football player Mo Salah which has positively impacted young people's attitudes. Accordingly, in a final analysis, newsletters play a quintessential constructive role in teenagers' attributes. \r\n\r\n      In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that not only does the availability of magazines help in their profound impact, but also they have an indispensable influence on teenagers' lives.

Some maintain that art should be an integral part of the study; however, there is another school of thought which dismisses this notion as they deem that it is the dissipation of time. In this essay, I will discuss both assertions and conclude that it is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful argument in favour of art being on the school curriculum is its profoundly positive impact on the development of children’s cognitive skills. By participating in art activities, children deploy a wide range of accomplishments, like decision-making, thereby enhancing them. Not only can art help children have a fertile imagination, but also promotes lateral thinking in them. It can, therefore, have far-reaching implications, as this expertise are also crucial to learning other subjects; hence it appears logical to suggest that art improve outcomes in all subjects.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  these substantial benefits, it seems this subject is of no consequence to some. They point out schools should prioritise core subjects, like physics, arguing STEM skills are vital for students’ future lives and art is worthless. Given the fact that not all pupils have the opportunity to pursue their interest in art academies or at home, was art excluded from the school curriculum, they would not be able to understand the value of the arts, nor would those who are artistically inclined hone their skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I subscribe to the theory that art should be a part of the curriculum in view of the fact art education is critical to students’ personal and educational development, and it is inextricably linked to other disciplines as it can foster those skills also needed for them.",

I maintain the same viewpoint on this concept, perceiving that each country may not have sufficient power and efficient technologies to be accountable for global problems.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is irrefutable that worldwide environmental issues distributed across many countries at the same time. Therefore, these issues have contributed to negative impacts on plenty of regions, no matter their wealth or policy. For example, the spreading of greenhouse effects or climate change is a result of divergent anthropogenic factors in numerous areas such as high traffic on roads and the release of toxic gases in  industries. Thus, the establishment of international organizations provides more cooperation among regions and power to minimize the effects of challenges that will appear.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the absence of technologies required to be handled by each government may aggravate the situation from a global perspective. To explain, the majority of undeveloped nations do not have proper solutions and innovational technics to be accountable by their own self. To justify, the 17 sustainable development goals by the UN are one of the prominent examples of how   versatile solutions for all countries are shared to solve general environmental problems.

Personally, I strongly agree that these funds should be directed towards public services that have a more direct, immediate impact on people's daily lives.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why space exploration should be reconsidered. Firstly, such missions can be a tremendous expense, requiring vast amounts of money for astronaut training, rocket and space shuttle construction, and advanced technology development. Secondly, the exploration of space does not have a direct impact on the lives of ordinary citizens who struggle with challenges such as earning a livelihood and maintaining health. Lastly, space research can pose risks to astronauts' lives. Although unmanned spacecraft can minimize the involvement of human beings in dangerous tasks, accidents can still occur.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that the money spent on space research would be better allocated towards schools and hospitals. Firstly, it is more cost-effective to train teachers and doctors than astronauts. Dollars spent on education programs can equip young people with knowledge and skills that can improve their efficiency in the workplace, thereby improving their standard of living. Secondly, if governments opt to channel the funds previously used for space travel towards building hospitals and providing quality healthcare to citizens, people will feel safer and happier as they will receive support from national authorities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I advocate for the reallocation of funds to areas of education and healthcare that have a more direct impact on people's lives, rather than expending vast amounts of money on exploring space and remote planets.",

Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere are several merits to teaching drawing or painting at school. To start with, they foster the creativity of children. The very act of holding a pencil and making shapes on paper improve the motor skills and hand-eye coordination of children. This is the main reason why most schools teach drawing to primary students. Another advantage of including these lessons is that they help children to discover their inherent talents for painting or drawing. Those who have a flair of drawing can then join a drawing school to hone their skills.\r\n\r\nThe main argument against making these lessons a part of the curriculum is that they waste the time of children who have no aptitude for drawing. Some parents are also disappointed that these classes rarely teach anything beyond the basics.\r\n\r\nWhile these arguments might sound logical, the truth is that drawing benefits everyone. Of course, not all children who learn drawing at school will become an eminent artist when they grow up. However, this is hardly a reason to remove drawing classes from the curriculum. Even if a child does not become a professional painter in the future, she will still benefit from the improved motor coordination skills she acquired through drawing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the argument that drawing lessons are useless does not hold water for the simple reason that the act of drawing improves the cognitive and intellectual skills of all children including those who have no talent for drawing.",

        "prompt": "Studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison. Do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels. Although this way could be associated with some benefits, I believe that the government should implement better alternatives to tackle the problem\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, educating criminals in prisons could be beneficial for alleviating the crime rate. For one thing, education for offenders in prison provides them some fundamental knowledge to pursue higher education programs and may change their awareness. Countries such as Singapore, where to allow prisoners to study during the execution of the sentence, regularly have the lowest crime rate among the parts of the world. For another, offering a learning program in prisons for criminals could be regarded as a way of assisting them to get a job after release from prison. In fact, some prisons enable inmates to learn vocational training such as computer programming, graphic design, which may facilitate them to earn a living. This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some reasons why education could not be considered as a proper measure for offenders during their time in prison. Firstly, such a form of education is offered for those who engage in wrongful acts, and therefore this could diminish the crime level to a certain extent. Instead, equipping students with crime knowledge in school will help shape crime prevention thinking and awareness for students, which will significantly reduce crime rates in the long term. Secondly, for some criminals who could not change their minds by educating, harsh punishment or even serving longer sentences would be better. Indeed, for some white-collar crimes who have highly educated and high positions in society, such as lawyers or doctors, there is no point in educating them rather than implementing a policy of zero tolerance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge",

If people have a healty body, they can do anything from studying untill working. However, if something bad happen like pandemic COVID 19, the other sector to be paralyze. People can not doing anything when the government applied lockdown, and it is required a lot of money to support it.

For instance, CT-scan machine and patient's bed with many fiture are the most expensive's equipments that hospital need. \r\n\r\nHowever, other sector also substantial to support by tax.

Which could be beneficial for both the nation and the individual. I am strongly in the favour of these believers. This essay will highlight a few of the advantages in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most predominant benefit of this trend is that the teenager could broaden their minds in the field. In other words, they can have good knowledge of the fieldwork in their school tenure which can be helpful for them to dive into the work easily. For instance, if youngster invests their free time to assist society's tasks, it can increase their wisdom which could be helpful in their job searching. On the other hand, Society can have an advantage from teenagers' unpaid services in many aspects such as cleaning the city's debris or working in a public library. Thus, volunteering could have multifarious benefits for both. \r\n\r\nTo strengthen the view of advantage is that youngster can increase their communication skills and good life experience by interacting with elderly people. To explain it, teenagers can do unpaid service in old aged homes which could be a blessing for them and help to avoid elder loneliness. For example, By doing this, will not only increase their communication skill, but also they can obtain their whole life's experience. Therefore, society can make a strong bond between youngsters.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, If all teenagers started to invest their free time in community services, it will not only help society, but also they can get good knowledge and better their communication skills.",

        "essay": "People's views differ as museums should be concerned as places for citizens and tourists to have a blast or for individuals to discover more about the culture or history of localities. While educating the civilizations through museums is crucial, I stand by the idea that museums' should be a source of entertainment.\r\nOn the one hand, it can be argued that one of the reasons museums are needed for educational purposes is that they can work as live presentations. As various subjects at school related to History and Art have been read by many students but not every person is capable of remembering such long theoretical texts. By visiting such practical places, students are able to acknowledge the aspect of that subject more explicitly. Besides, not only museums support students' knowledge, but they also teach visitors something that they did not previously know as they exhibit collections of interesting objects that hold significant cultural or historical values. It means that the history behind the museums' exhibits needs to be explained by professional guides talking to their visitors or offering headsets to visitors so that they can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition.\r\nOn the other hand, I would argue that museums should be entertaining and more attractive to the public. Museums are widely considered as important tourist attractions for any city or country. However, there’s a common belief that they are too elitist, uninspiring and only encourage educated people to visit. By adding more entertainment values, museums can appeal to a broader audience. Nowadays there is also a wide range of museums which do not have academic purpose; but more light-hearted and humorous theme; for example; chocolate museum in Belgium, kimchi museum in South Korea, museum of Broken Relationships in Croatia or cheese museum in The Netherlands.\r\nIn conclusion, it is a matter of debate that what should be the purpose of museums. While museums can be used for providing knowledge, I believe that it' should be entertaining to increase the influence on the public.",

Playing games pros and cons will be discussed in the following paragraphs as long as I still hold the view that playing would havehas positive effects on children. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, playing video games would provide players with a sense of achievement and accomplishment. With these sensitivities, children would be addicted to games where they could be winners and feel proud of themself which could stick them in a virtual world and being isolated from the real world. Furthermore, in-game purchases have become more and more popular so that children could waste their money on them. As a result, purchasing in-game could become a trend in school which forms an inefficient money-usage habit for kids. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many studies show that both brain hemispheres would be developed when playing games. To be specific, playing online games with friends could maintain their relationships in school and enhance communication skills. Moreover, to complete missions in games, children have to promote their creativity and team-working skills which could be an essential part of their future life. In terms of mental health, playing games would be a good way to release stress after a hustle school day. Having a well-being lifestyle is a goal of many people, indeed, playing games could be a convenient way to balance work and entertainment. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while having pros and cons in some particular situations, video games could give more advantages if we could keep the drawbacks in control.

        "essay": "In this contemporary epoch, the public has become fully aware of the importance of voluntary work, especially when it is conducted by youth in their free time. I strongly support this view and will elaborate my stance in this essay with arguments in the below paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe first main reason behind my agreement is that youth will take the advantage of conducting such community work to develop themselves and build their social networks. To cite an example,  young men in some Europe countries are required to volunteer around 150 hours yearly in  community work such as planting trees, this would be helpful for them in terms of social development and building networks in their communities. \r\n\r\nAnother piece of evidence why I support this view is that unpaid works encourage teenagers to be generous and to support poor people. For example, when a young man immerses himself to hold and perform community free workshops and ceremonies with poor students, he will really enhance those people's lives. As a result, the communities will be able to develop gradually in many sectors and jump to the next level. \r\n\r\nMoreover, teenagers will feel more productive, organized and energetic when they exploit their free time to serve their communities. For instance, a conducted research in Sweden states that the self-satisfaction of the teenagers who performed unpaid community work was three folds higher than the satisfaction of whom don’t engage in such voluntary work. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, many people feel the importance of teenagers’ engagement with unpaid community works in their free time to develop their communities.  Personally, I think conducting the voluntary work will be a strong pillar in the teenager’s curriculum vitae, and encourage poor communities to develop.",

It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.\r\nOn the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses.

        "essay": "There is currently an ongoing debate about the importance of storytelling from parents to their children. Whereas this is considered essential to some, others are of the opinion that storytelling could be replaced altogether by other activities, such as watching TV, films or reading books. Although  there are many arguments for and against the discussion, I believe children should keep listening to their parent’s stories, and there are many points that can support my view:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, storytelling reinforces the relationship that youngsters have with their parents. This is of paramount importance, especially nowadays, when children spend most of their day separated from their parents since work shifts have become significantly longer. Telling fairy tales and fables before going to bed, for example, is a very positive way to spend time between adults and their toddlers. Secondly, parents are the most important models in children’s lives, and therefore their stories deeply affect the way youngsters define their personalities and, most importantly; their beliefs.This way, parents can educate  and positively influence the small ones by simply telling them past experiences or making them travel to imaginary worlds. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, it is true that seeking  stories from sources different to parents is also a good way to get children to discover and analyse other points of view, especially in topics that society considers controversial. For example, if parents see homosexuality as something negative, this belief will be most likely expressed at home. However, if children in this situation watch TV they will also encounter that there are many programs in which some of the characters are single-sex couples, which would make them rethink  the topic from a completely opposite point of view. Consequently , they would define their beliefs after having received more information.  Besides this, by watching films, children can let their imagination go, normally in a more vivid way than they would do by stories that are told by their parents. Nowadays, there are so many special effects that create fantastic scenarios and make watchers believe for a moment that all these imagined worlds are real. As a result, children develop their imagination and creativity significantly more than they would do just by simply  listening to stories at home. \r\n\r\nAs I have discussed, there are advantages and disadvantages to the topic. However, I believe that, by no means, TV, films and books should replace the habit of storytelling from parents to their toddlers, as this contributes to creating strong bonds in families.",

This essay will discuss why eventually very few jobs are carried out by humans rather than robots.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Robots should be eventually carried out most of the jobs which does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies are concerned with artificial intelligence because it is far better than recruiting,training and employing human. In some weaving factories in India, for example, many workers are replaced by automated weaving machines that cost less than employees. In addition, these automated machine works round the clock and require no holidays. For these reasons jobs which need of artificial intelligence will be carried out by robots.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them.

Some people stated that due to differences in physical features as well as abilities, women are limited to taking on the so-called men’s occupation and vice versa. However, in my opinion, it is unjust to bear such stereotype in mind due to the reasons as follow. \r\nFirstly, broad generalization about characteristics of men and women create public’s misconceptions on people’s ability in their suitable careers. Though it is evident that men and women do not share common characteristics, there are still exceptions in terms of human abilities. For example, the majority of people would consider politicians be male rather than female; nevertheless, talented female governors starts to prove their excellent ability in the political field as time pass by. Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity.\r\nSecondly, gender equality in workplace would provide a more balanced working environment. As a matter of fact, each gender has a distinct way of processing information, hence people can broaden their knowledge by taking opposite gender’s approach to an issue into consideration. If men are more of a logical thinking creature, women on the other hand, will have the tendency toward creativity. By combining two of these aspects, a sense of balance at workplace is likely to remains stably. \r\nIn conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender.",

For example, plenty of rainforests which are vital to stabilize climate change are destroyed to make paper. At the same time, due to a lack of supervision, many factories, which use fossil fuel energy,  pay no attention to limiting the emission of greenhouse gases, as a result, the more products they produce, the more they contribute to  global warming.

Firstly, authorities can introduce laws to reduce the emission of waste air, such as increasing taxes on the use of coal and oil, in this way, plants can be forced to manage to use green energy.

This essay will elaborate on the arguments and show sports activities have more merit.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why many people opt for including competitive sports in school curriculum. The first reason is that it promotes children’s health, which consists of physical and mental health. Playing sports may boost the resistance to obesity, diabetes and other diseases and it is a good way of doing the exercise. Moreover, competitive sports help children relieve stress, depression and emotional problems caused by tensions in relationships. As a result, they are likely to be more relaxed, tireless and energetic. Furthermore, it is suggested that changing sports enhance children’s skills such as: setting their goals, sharpening the leader skill and organising teamwork. For example, if students take part in a sport match, they are likely to collaborate to strive for defeating the rival.Hence, the fighting spirits help them how to work to achieve their certain goal and increase their responsibility for the team.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is argued that challenging sports are time-consuming and this may distract children’s attention from their own study.If children do not balance between studying and playing, they may be attracted by rounds in competitive sports and this leads to lack of concentration on their studies and miss the lessons in class.

Moreover, it is obvious that community will get benefit from it as it will help to build harmonious society.  \r\n\r\nThere are three reasons why I recommend to include teenagers in unpaid social work.

Moreover, teenagers will feel the sense of being included and being part of the society which help them to grow mentally and physically. Thus, I strongly support to involve teenager in social activities. \r\n\r\nSecondly, encouraging teenagers in social work will help to lower the risk of them getting involved in illegal activities. As teenagers are very curious by the nature to see the world and they can easily influences by other as their articulative ability to distinguise right and wrong is not fully develop, they might choose the wrong way during this stage of life.

Young adults, for example, used to have no choice but to go to work at industrial factories with terrible conditions because there were no other opportunities at the time. Nowadays, instead, it is thanks to the new possibilities that youngsters have plenty of jobs to choose from. In addition, the new era has also introduced new careers and courses that anyone can fulfil and achieve.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to the new ways of the modern world. There are now many traditional arts and crafts getting lost and forgotten. As a result, some aspects of our culture will never be recovered. For instance, trade skills that our grandfathers used to learn and perform at school are most likely lost due to the new educational system, now more related to the technological world. Nonetheless, academics have explained that the concept of progress also implies adapting to changes that ultimately will prove absolutely essential for our civilization's further growth. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the disadvantages the new developments have brought about, it is clear to me that changes have mostly proved beneficial to our society and to every individual. That is why I believe the advantages of the new developments far outweigh their negative effects.",

        "prompt": "In many countries, government spent large sum of money on the arts, and this is supported by some taxpayers as both why. Other, however, think that this money would be better spent on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "essay": "Nowadays , people have different opinions on whether government authorities use the amount of tax payable by the public spending on museums and on art galleries. However, others point of view that utilise this money on healthcare and education centres. Although this essay considers both sides of this contention notion, I tend to believe that spending tax amount on developing health centres and the education sector is more beneficial because of the development of the nation besides the improvement in the economy.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, some people including me support the argument that this money is wisely utilised for the development of  academic institutions. This is because myriads of countryside areas where not only lack schools but also children become illiterate. Hence, the country does not develop and remains in the backward step as compared to other nations. Tim Cooper, from Sheffield Hallam ,University points out that according to his research developed countries conduct new experiments on a daily basis and achieve a higher position as compared to developing ones.\r\n\r\nMoving on, another worth mentioning point is that if government construct healthcare centres in each area with amelioration technology. As the result, people do not have to go to foreign nations for the treatment of their diseases. This is because  their own country fulfils their requirements and they pay high taxes for using the services. To epitomise, The Times of India, conduct a survey and found that 37% of the public go to other countries for the treatments like cancer and pay huge charges for procedures. As a consequence, making other nations wealthier while their own countries become poor.\r\n\r\nShifting to other aspects, another school of thought opposes the idea of the advancement of hospitals and educational institutions. As they may think spending money on Museums and art galleries is a favourable concept because these enhance knowledge of tradition and culture since independence and children generate interest and are always connected with their roots. Furthermore, this is the factor which strengthens their viewpoint and cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the community have found it hard to reach a consensus on where to spend money on museums or on clinics and the education systems. Despite a few individuals saying that tradition is important, In my viewpoint facilities like treatment and educating people has more weightage because boost the income of the government and educate people.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "The world is now surrounded by many urgent environmental problems, and many people feel that raising the cost of fuel is one of the most effective ways of combatting them. Although I tend to agree with this viewpoint, I believe there are other environmental measures that need to be taken. \r\n\r\nIncreasing petrol prices would help save the environment in many ways. As the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing dramatically, so is the amount of vehicular emissions released into the atmosphere. However, if governments increase fuel costs, this solution would serve as a deterrent for people who drive their private cars, reducing air pollution and ozone layer depletion. Besides discouraging people from driving their private cars, this would also generate income to make further investments in environmental initiatives. Given these potential benefits of raising fuel prices, is it hardly surprising to see so many countries applying it to practice.\r\n\r\nApart from increasing the cost of fuel, we can also implement other solutions to environmental issues. For instance, on an individual level, people who want to help the environment should become more environmentally responsible by buying eco-friendly products, and reusing and recycling plastic bags. They can also take public transport as opposed to their personal cars, which produce toxic fumes. From a government’s perspective, it is essential to switch to green energy sources, such as solar and wind, rather than continuing to rely on gas and petrol. Thus, environmental protection goes beyond just raising fuel prices. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though I attach great importance to the practice of increasing fuel costs, I think that both individuals and governing bodies should become environment-oriented in their mindset to tackle environmental problems.",

        "essay": "Nowadays museums play a significant role in preserving the historical values of ancient times. Some people assert, that the prominent aim of them should be an entertaining character, while others consider, that historical instituitions should teach people to immerse deeply in past. From my personal standpoint, I maintain the first viewpoint on this concept, perceiving that they are essential for increasing the number of visitors and for encouraging the young generation in past time events.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the redevelopment of historical sites for entertainment may interest more people in local tradition and culture. Und\r\n\r\neniably, learning past chronology can be challenging for those who are not professionally involved in it. For example, if the government engages in  plenty of innovative approaches to museum pieces of art or stories, it will foster a better understanding of the main ideas and values for all age groups. Therefore, museums will be a versatile place where families have the opportunity to spend leisure time with children as well as researchers to learn new about past.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever, it can be considered into account that such places have been established for dedicating the escalation of the previous generations' mistakes. Thus, the development of a modern recreational approach to historical buildings leads to the devaluation of the principles of museums. To explain, scientific researchers or junior historians will not be more able to rely on museums as the source of truthful information, if the content of such places is aimed to make history clear and comprehensible for the large target audience. That is why museums should be taken seriously and adhere to the traditional purpose of education.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there exist several strong rationales that underscore the significance of redevelopment  of the museum's concepts for addressing the better understanding of visitors. Even though it is irrefutable, that they were initially constructed as the place for training and finding historical references, I firmly believe, that they should provide more enjoyment for the majority of the population to increase the number of visitors.",

        "essay": "As people grow old, they are seeking more financial attention, while it is possible that at their young age, they must plan for their retirement however it is the fundamental responsibility of the government to take care of their senior citizens financially. This essay will discuss why eventually the responsibility lies with the government.\r\n\r\nRetirement plans are considered to be significant for the individual. At the young age a person does care about their saving for rainy days, instead they tend to spend on every single glitter available in the market, without realising the consequences after the retirement because they felt that they must be pleased themselves now and stop planning about the future, for example, a recent study by the EIA brokerage firm, suggested that people with life bracket between  25 years to 30 years, it is necessary for them to consider pullout strategy. Overall, an individual compels himself to contemplate their arrangement at the early age to avoid burdensome to others at their departure.       \r\n\r\n\r\nConversely, It is the foremost responsibility of the regime to arrange better fund strategy for retirees, as they would not be competent enough to work after 60 years of age because of their health and mental capacity does not allow them to do so, additionally they contribute through hefty taxes to country development, For instance, In Australia, a person have to  submit 9.5% of their wages to superannuation fund which eventually pay them back after their evacuation. Personal saving will never be able to achieve what has been taken by authorities over hundred of years to achieve.    \r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the state retirement plan will eventually supersede entirely the individual saving methods, however the regime must designed appropriate system and follow them up for their implementation.

        "essay": "The tradition of living with parents even after post-marriage years is relatively common in some of the Asian countries, such as India and China. Although living under such an arrangement might hinders couple privacy, there are other advantages which are so immense that they easily supersede any of the shortcomings of the joint-family culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant advantages of living along with parents is that they provide an excellent supervision opportunity to grandchildren. If both guardians are working fulltime, they can leave their infants under the custody of their grandparents. For instance, during my childhood period both of parents were working professionals and they used to come home late in the evening, I had spent most of my after-school-hours with my grandfather.\r\n\r\nAnother factor to consider is that while living with elderly parents, adults could look after of their physical and mental health. This is also a social and cultural norm in some countries to take care of parent’s health by staying with them, rather than admitting them to old-homes. Thus, such an approach is not only safeguard country’s tradition and culture, but also provide an ideal opportunity to elders to stay close with their loved ones, especially in the later years of their lives.\r\n\r\nContrarily, living in a big family may offer some challenges in term of lack of privacy. That is to say, by living in a single house with full of people, huslabel and wife may not be able to share their private moments expressively. However, this problem can be mitigated if the house provided is large enough and it can be divided into separate sections. In this way, everyone can live freely without being interfered by others.\r\n\r\nBy and large, in certain parts of the world married adults, even with their children, choose to live with their parents. While this approach may not be able to offer full privacy to their personal lives, other advantages, such as children supervision and taking take of parent’s health, clearly offer more benefits than drawbacks.\r\n",

        "essay": "“Some believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that   leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.”  Introduction  According to people perspective leadership is a god gifted quality that cannot be learned but that people’s  perspective and nothing in this world can’t be learned with dedication and repetition.  Leadership is an action not a position. The matter of fact is that the practical meaning of leadership is far   different from theoretical world. The bookish language will assist you for sure but to be a great leader, a  person should hold two qualities courage and persistence along with hard work and that leads him to   enormous victories.  In my opinion if a person has this god gifted quality and yet does not utilize his true potential in terms of   leadership that means he runs his own life by himself and on the other hand if a person aims to change he   will ;indeed.  ‘’Man cannot remake himself without suffering for he is both the marble and the sculpture’’  There is an example of leadership qualities of Nelson Mandela who always think for the next generation, never focus election. He always motivate his nation, and picked his nation from the darkness to bright   future, he always talked about rule of law and never broke any law.  And for those who think that leadership qualities can built actually they were talking about politicians and   politicians always show-off their activities just act like leaders but they are not leaders and they not have   leadership qualities, they always focused just on the next election to make people fool. The best example  of such type people of is Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan.  That applies to the fact that if you are desperate enough to attain heights of success then for sure you will   attain. This then ends the contradiction that leadership is a quality people are naturally born with, with   dedication anyone can learn the art of leadership, coming to the conclusion of my essay.  Leadership always born naturally the their qualities are GOD-GEFITED but peoples can also learn a lot Good Qualities as leaders have, with the passage of time.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, the world has become one united opt to technological development, which brings all nations together. Some advocate that  international interaction has a great impact on the environment. While others disagree, and believe that it can play an integral role in the commercial and business sectors. I am convinced with  both notions, and my contention will be further explained in the following lines. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand,  international cooperation has an indispensable role in economic prosperity for several reasons. Firstly, it can encourage investments, which participate in increasing the employment rate. Secondly, it can introduce a foreign currency, that can establish a solid base, and strengthen the infrastructure of the government. Furthermore, it can act as a tool for soaring the income of the individuals, which in turn will reflect on the citizen's habits, and lifestyle. For instance, the Egyptian authority has signed a plethora of conventions with a foreign state like Japan; in order to introduce the Japanese strategies and machines to deal with economic hurdles in Egypt.  Hence, with international exchange a myriad of advantages will be reflected on the country in numerous sectors not only in business. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, currently, climate change and  environmental topics have been heated constantly. Many urge that the foreign conventions will be of great impact on our ecosystem. To illustrate, the presence of novel technical devices have brought numerous inventions that may aid in reducing the contamination that has been created by using fuel, and charcoal. Moreover, it can tackle  deforestation, which has been developed in numerous countries. Not only that, but it can also be an active tool to eliminate air pollution and factories' waste products, which act as a source of contamination, that can jeopardize human and animals health. For example, numerous cities all over the world have impeded the idea of sustainable products and renewable energy to mitigate pollution, and produce an ecosystem.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above viewpoint. It can be reiterated that, international assistance can participate in both environmental, and economical sectors. Therefore, the government should increase its collaboration to create a peaceful  environment.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, the government's investment has never failed to provoke debates among people. Some suppose that spending money on developing technology for space discovery is worthless, others make a statement that there are more tremendous tactics to utilize that amount of money. This essay is dedicated to analysing a personal perspective. \r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of doubt, exploring the universe acts as a precursor to our life since it helps humans to find a new habitable planet. Nowadays, overpopulation has become a dire issue which exerts the lack of living space as well as the overexploitation of natural sources due to higher hierarchies. On top of that, with the groundbreaking development of the economy, there is an ever-increasing number of factories and private transportation. These two elements serve as a main drive to a thriving carbon footprint and then lead to air pollution and respiratory disease. While the Earth is suffering from recession, it is necessary to discover a new place as a backup plan in the future. \r\n\r\nDespite the redeeming features of space exploring, other fields should not be neglected. In specific, education also needs investing as it plays a paramount significant role for long-term development. Once getting access to school in order to absorb knowledge as well as hone set of skills, students will become aspiring for a quality workforce, which facilitates the company’s productivity. Furthermore, it will enhance a country’s economy. However, there are still existing problems like many impoverished teenagers can not get tertiary education, a tight budget may hinder the students from having practical experiments. With a view to addressing these issues, there is a myriad of ways that can be cited such as reducing the tuition fees, applying top-notch technology or giving scholarships. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, space exploration may have beneficial merits to humans, however, besides, education should also be considered investing.",

        "prompt": "People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?",
        "essay": "Across the globe, certain individuals have the tendency to give birth to their heir in old age. Even though there are existing diseases attached to having children in old age, it helps the couple to be financially stable and emotionally ready for which I think that the benefits are far more important than the drawbacks as there is medical management to curb the diseases. However, early childbearing can deter both the mother's and the child's growth.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, one of the major disadvantages of giving birth late is that of the complication that comes with it which increases the risk of miscarriage. Women at advanced age tend to have an abortion in their first trimester due to abnormalities that increase with maternal age. For example, about 50% of couples have experienced complexities during childbirth as a result of the mother's age. Nevertheless, these difficulties can be treated with the aid of medical practitioners or experts, making them less significant.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the above minor drawback, I believe that the advantages associated with having children at advanced age far supersedes its demerit. One reason for this is, it helps  the couple to be financially stable. At this stage, parents are settled in their chosen careers, have built a home, and are capable of providing valuable education and life experiences for their offspring. Another reason is emotional maturity, the couples have the chance to experience a lot of life with all its ups and downs, sorrows and jo, making wise parenting decisions based on the father and mother's maturity and life experiences.  For instance, a survey conducted by Dr Salber says, youngsters of older moms were better behaved, well-socialized and emotionally healthy. Furthermore,  parents at this old age earn a higher salary and they have a huge sense of maturity which play a role in better parenting, in essence making it more meaningful.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is better to be financially and emotionally matured before giving birth to offspring in spite of the complications faced during childbirth at an advanced life.",

This essay will look at the reason and give alternative ways to do background research on a house or building where people live in.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why people want to know the past of a place, first, they are just curious, and second, they want to know the track record of the house which will reflect indirectly the quality of the construction. Curiosity is one of the human beings, people being curious on the history of the house such as who had built this residence, who were the owners before, or even why this house was being sold. Moreover, the second type is people who want to know the track record of the building, this mainly comes from a broker who wants to sell a residence.  For instance, the information about the house will help a broker to understand the age and quality of the house.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to know the history of a house, people can do several methods such as asking the neighbourhood, reading the certificate of the house, or if the building is famous enough they can search on the internet. For instance, when a person wants to know about who was owning a house before buying it, the old neighbourhood around it can be asked, such as the track record of how this house was renovated in the past.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people seek the history of a house or building because they are just curious or they want to know the track record and the quality of the building.

        "essay": "While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.",

To a certain point, I would partly agree with the statement, but there are other methods that could also be used to improve it as imposing a stricter penalty, beside, is not the only way to ensure safety on roads.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, enforcement of hard punishment on people who are not following traffic rules is a most important way to maintain harmony on roads. Individual should maintain road discipline while driving. However, for youngsters who do rash driving, the only ways to educate them is by imposing heavy penalties and fine.As per a survey, most of the people follow the rules only of fear of punishment. If they are not under any pressure of punishment they will not do what they are suppose to do. Hence, in my opinion the best way to maintain smooth roads is by application of rigid punishments.\r\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, there is another method that the government could use in improving road safety besides having a stricter punishment. They could make a campaign about safety driving through various media which would show the effect of careless driving.

As more people are watching these videos, it is hoped that drivers will have a clearer view of safety driving.\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, to a certain extent, I agree that having a stricter punishment would improve road safety.

        "essay": "The increasing desire for consumer goods today has accelerated industrial production and this poses a threat to the environment. This essay will delineate the reasons for this and also propose solutions for these concomitant environmental risks.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental degradation due to the production of consumer goods can be traced back to governmental shortcomings. Competition between countries makes it nearly impossible to agree on a cohesive global policy. There are attempts, like the recent Paris accords, but many powerful countries, chiefly the United States and China, fear losing their competitive advantages and are unwilling to sign over their autonomy. Developing countries also feel that protecting the environment handicaps them and is a lower priority than rising standards of living. This is coupled with the rise of corporate lobbying groups and corruption in governments around the world. Powerful companies can fund studies for bills that support their efforts to ramp up production and downplay the environmental costs.\r\n\r\nThe environmental implications of a consumer economy can be mitigated through an array of strict governmental regulations. The best examples of these laws come from environmentally conscious nations in Europe. The European Union has signed every global accord put before them and is making great strides in enforcing among its constituent members the agreed-upon limits set forth in these charters. These include allowing countries to buy carbon credits, banning plastic bags and controlling the disposal of toxic waste. There are also more proactive solutions that entail encouraging renewable energies such as solar and wind power. The rest of the world can learn from these European reforms how to wean themselves off an unhealthy dependence on the fossil fuels that underpin consumerism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government is to blame for the impact of a consumer economy on the environment and they also hold the keys to averting future catastrophe. However, it is unlikely governments will opt to act until the situation is already beyond a tipping point.",

In my view, modern life forcses people to become more dependent than they used to be.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why it is argued that people rely more on others. Firstly, education nowadys students receive encourage them to live on thier own.  And manny facts prove this like more students choosing to live in their own house and do part-time job when they go the college. Moreover, the big and tight family have transformed to small and seperate family. Hence, people have  to solve many problems by themselves instead of asking for the help from the siblings.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would agree with those who believe that people are  more dependent these days.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in the past, people used to accomplish the whole job by themselves. However, to improve the quality and quantity of the work, people are always working in groups nowadays. The job is specified in many section and different people would specilase in one of them. Hence, people are more dependent on expert during work. Another reason is due to the soaring price of the housing. Today, people cannot afford  the house price on their own  so they have to accept the help from thier parents.

It can be clearly seen that being able to ensure families’ safety is a noteworthy advantage. Indeed, by possessing guns at home can residents maintain their security towards potential menace such as terrorists or armed thieves. For instance, a buglar sneaked into my acquaintance's house, threatening his family members using a knife. However, my acquaintance was able to force the stealer to go away by taking out his shotgun. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, when the second stance is taken into account, it can be envisioned that the minuses outnumber the pluses.

As an example, it is estimated that the number of young offenders’ attacks towards schools skyrocketed by 200 cases in the course of 11 years, commencing from 2011. Furthermore, most of the cases are related to gun violence. Moreover, having guns also threaten the safety of societies and communities. For instance, after being involved in a gun fight between two thug clans, one of my friends, who is living in a country which has no restrictions towards guns owning, always feels being threatened and terrified whenever he has to go out of his house.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I pen down by reconfirming that having guns at home has a merit and two demerits. Nonetheless, the question posed here is how to harness its strengths and mitigate its weaknesses for a better future.",

        "essay": "The recent development of technology has threatened certain types of occupations. Hence, some claim that in the near future almost all the jobs will be invaded by these machines. In my opinion, of course robots will play a significant role in the future, but they will not take over the whole job market.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, each an every machine or robot has been designed and developed by human minds. Yes, it is true that these artificial creatures can do a lot of things. But, someone needs to program with correct instruction in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decision because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence. Moreover, these devices should be designed by someone, always those tasks are done by human beings. For instance, a robot can instruct to repair a car, yet it could not instruct to design a car. Because that needs a higher level of intelligence. Another common fact is that robots cannot process empathy. As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors which need social skills.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour work do not need much of brain power. Those work only needs to repeat some actions. Hence, those types of work will be done by robots in the future. As a result, people should move away from works that only needs physical strength and learn the work require metal skills. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although some jobs are taken over by robots, these electronic and mechanical devices will not be able to take over the occupations that need empathy and higher intelligence levels.",

        "essay": "It  is claimed by many parents that they believe their child would be better off going to a single-sex school than a mixed centre of learning. I strongly disagree with this statement and this essay will detail the reasons why.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that more and more countries around the world are adding to their education system separate academies for boys and girls, I believe that this approach is not effective when we speak about modern life and teenagers. This is because kids have to learn to live in a society where both genders are present. It is extremely important that these foundations are laid in childhood. For instance, my mom went to such an educational institution. As a result, she had to face some difficulties later on. This manifested in unability to chat with the opposite gender, that is why she lost a lot of time in her youth.   If she had gone in usual school, she would have had more life expirience.  \r\n\r\nAnother drawback is that not all girls, for example, like to socialize with each other. By way of illustration, not all girls have something in common with each other,  likewise, it would be more comfortable for a youngster to communicate with the opposite sex. I also believe that these colleges are relics of the past, where men and women studied separately. It is no longer relevant today.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I want to say that it is wrong that some parents send their offspring to single-sex schools. In the future, when they grow up, they will have to live in a society where both genders are present. In the long run, difficulties may arise.",

        "essay": "It is undeniable that people all over the world are facing several matters such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, and many more. It is, therefore, some people contend that the state should consider the issue of environmental degradation and lack of houses so that diseases could be controlled. I firmly agree with the notion but it is not only a duty of the territory to save our environment from exploitation, but the common man should also be aware of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are quite a few reasons why the community demand that the government should give attention to these affairs. Because the province should make strict laws regarding environmental problems i.e encourage recycling, reuse waste products and even reduce garbage if possible by purchasing fewer packaging products. Also, limited vehicles on the road and population-controlling seminars could work well.  At the same time, the state should be built houses for those who are below the poverty line and just earn their bread and butter. This step of the government could be worthwhile for the homeless population because these kinds of people have to sleep on garbage sites which is ultimately a reason for several disorders. For example, according to an article published in 2018, in India 40% of beggars used to spend their whole days at railway stations and bus stops due to a lack of their house. Thus, the government should make rules to save the surroundings as well as to construct some medium-sized houses for the needy masses.\r\n\r\nConversely, why do I believe that individual actions are also required in order to address the concern? Even though the state should make some policies, individuals should put in their efforts so that our ecosystem is maintained. Society should use only eco bags for shopping instead of using plastic ones, the plastic water bottles on daily basis could be replaced by the installation of a water filter at the home. Furthermore, even poor community should arrange their own shelter, it could be a small rental place rather than one's own home so that they can spend their life purposefully. For instance, there has been some recorded instance of the population who have followed the checklists to protect their atmosphere from pollution. Overall, residents have the same responsibilities which could not be denied.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, facing shortcomings is a common concern among the public. However, serious steps could be taken to lessen the effect of the problems, that's why it is the fundamental responsibility of both the governing body and human beings to put their efforts at their own level for environmental protection.",

New buildings can be lived a longer period to compared the old museums. I partially agree with this statement and that essay discusses it briefly for the following reasons. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, certainly, capital should be spent on new museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones because these kinds of new museums can be lived a longer period, new modernized buildings can be built with a better interior design and all the amenities. In addition, these can be given enormous convenient to the population might be used happily.  For example, in India has built new museums for the population instead of spending money on renovating olds. Therefore, money should be spent on new buildings. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, finance can spend on renovating old buildings because these actions need a minimum amount of money, resources, labour and everything. Moreover, demolishing's building can be created numerous economic loss towards the nations. For instance, in western nation cannot demolish to their old bildings, besides, they can renovate old buildings. Hence, renovating is the best idea rather than building new ones. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, when all things considered, I am convinced that both have positives and negatives. The government should be spent money on the proper and useful things. So, I partially agree with the thing indicated statements.

Firstly, one of the first characteristics of human beings is curiosity. This is because they would like to know which people lived there before them and satisfy their feelings. Secondly, there are some concerns in terms of maintenance of the property.

A certain people claim that computer games are detrimental to the youngsters’ health being while a few thinks it has some positive impacts on the child’s growth. In this essay, I will shed lights on these boons as well as analyze the negative aspects of playing games in front of computer screens.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the most notable advantages of playing computer games is skills improvement. Playing computer games help enrich the young generation’s reflexion and logical thinking by providing practise in problem solving and tactical situations. In addition, the juvenile are able to meet and strike up a friendship with like minded people and share ideas with them.\r\n\r\nDespite those benefits, spending a great amount of time playing games will face climbing rate of deleterious health issues; including obesity, heart diseases and so on.

Furthermore, violent contents in computer games could have egregious impacts on children’s behaviour since the young people would imitate the ferocious acts in the games\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, no doubt there are some pros involved in playing video games.

There are adequate justifications for this issue and also a number of appropriate approaches to find data of the living house. \r\n\r\nRecently, various people have dedicated their time to increasing their knowledge about their homes or apartments. The first reason is that they want to assure  that their prosperities do not have legal problems. For example, if the previous owner did not pay taxes . Finding the maps and materials, which were used for the construction of the building is another reason. To further illustrate, in several areas of the world, where many earthquakes take place regularly, it is fundamental to be sure that your home is able to resist.\r\n\r\n In addition, there are a variety of ways that people can achieve the required information. To begin with, they are to ask local officials or bank authorities about the history of the house, therefore the owner can find out if there are any debts or mortgages related to the building. Surfing the internet is also the best way in order to find data about the conventional materials of the houses in one particular area, as well as the maps.

        "essay": "Elderly people are important for every nation, although some think that government intervention is needed to assist their funds during retirement, while some individuals believe the elderly should have saved their income to take care of themselves. I believe older people should save their income during their employment, and government support is also needed for them. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, authorities should take responsibility for older people as they contributed to their workforce when they were young. For example, welfare services such as distributing food coupons or discount vouchers to buy from grocery stores. In addition, private and public sectors should work together to earn additional sources of income. For example, these sectors should provide incentives to invest elderly savings into businesses. By doing so, the elderly will have support when they retire as they receive income from these organisations. Furthermore, authorities should assist older peoplehealth-related problems, therefore, such costs may not be a burden to old people. Therefore, it can be seen that these supports will create a comfortable life for elderly people. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people should prepare for their retirement before they reach their retirement age. One of the preparations is to invest their savings into potential financial benefit sources such as investing in stocks. Additionally, individuals should also look into property markets. For example, they buy a property while they have enough spending and they can later rent to get an additional income. Moreover, the elderly should find ways to invest their savings into hedge funds where they could make a profit. Hence, there are many benefits when they know how to allocate their savings.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I think it is now obvious that old people should take charge of their funds with the help of governments, private and public sectors. With these collaborations between these parties, I trust the elderly will have a better future when they reach their retirement age.",

Although doing different jobs may have certain benefits, I personally believe that doing one job is a better way for individuals, companies. and society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are some reasons to change different occupations in one’s life. The first reason is that this can get employees to find their favourite jobs. This means that when workers try some occupations, they will know what they want and can follow the correct career path. The second reason for this is that workers can get more experience, acquire a lot of skills and have the opportunity to discover themselves. For instance, a worker who previously worked as an accountant can use their knowledge and experience in finance to run their own business.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is my firm belief that workers should do the same job  all their lives. To begin with, when people who graduate from  university focus on their major, they can develop their essential skills. Therefore, after a long time of improving in a major occupation, workers may become more professional and get higher positions in their careers. For example, in Vietnam, senior positions often require employees to stay with the company for many years. Moreover, another reason is that when working in a job for a long time, people can have a more stable income. This will help them have a stable life with a higher standard of living.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, choosing the same job or different jobs will depend on employees ' decisions  and both have their advantages.

I ultimately disagree with this view, as understanding students' feelings and interaction with them in the class are tasks that can not be achieved without teachers. This essay, therefore, will discuss these reasons in more details in the next paragraphs. \r\n\r\nTeachers, as human beings, are able to understand the feeling of students, while technology alone can not do this rule. This is because,  feelings are a complex process and technology is yet far from dealing with such a process. For instance, teachers are able to know if the pupils misunderstand a certain topic through their facial expressions. Without teachers, students will face many challenges in the classroom, while no one knows or understand that. Therefore, technology can not take the rule of teachers, due to a lack of understanding of students feelings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, without teachers in the ,classroom there is no interaction with students. Because, only humans have the ability to interact, while other technological tools do not. According to a recent research published by Freiburg university in 2019 : Scientists are unable to make interactive technology as humans can interact. Even though, with help of robotic teachers in the future, interaction skills are probably to be absent in the classes. Therefore, technology can not replace teachers interactions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though, the spread of technology, I disagree with the ability   to completely take place of teachers in the classroom.

I believe that people migrate for better future prospects and it is beneficial for their children.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people migrate to foreign nations because they want to provide a better life for their family and children. Most of these people migrate from underdeveloped countries to developed nations. This is because most of these developed countries provide free education and medical services to families. To illustrate further, Canada provides free medical care and education to its people. Furthermore, once youngsters complete their education they have much better job opportunities than they could have in their home country. As a result, youngsters feel more secure and satisfied.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others believe that migrating to a new country has a negative impact on children. To start with, they may find it harder to adjust to a new culture. Youngsters need time and friends to adjust to a new society and when they do not find friends, they feel isolated and many of them become the victim of depression. Moreover, a foreign language is another hurdle that they face. Many families who migrate from Asian countries to Europe are not fluent in a local language like English. Due to this, children feel insecure when they try to mingle with locals. For instance, according to a survey by Hindustan Times, 40 percent of Indian Punjabi youth finds themselves isolated In Ontario, Canada because they do not have good command over the English language.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although initially, youngsters find it difficult to adjust to  a new culture once they learn the local language and start mingling with locals as they find themselves in a much more  secure position due to various facilities like better education and free medical services along with better job opportunities in the future.",

Firstly, individuals can learn many skills while doing community work such as time management, teamwork and leadership. This is because they have to deal with numerous problems where these skills are required. Apart from that gaining valuable work experience and skills may be useful for acquiring a job of their personal choice. Moreover, teenagers can get a chance to meet new people and learn about different cultures which is the best usage of their free time.\r\n\r\nAt the societal level, it also contributes to the betterment of the community as well.

Even though the benefits of immediate-start jobs are undeniable, I strongly agree that everyone should consider enrolling in universities or colleges to have the best preparation for their future. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many young people prefer working rather than continuing to study due to several employment advantages. Specifically, getting a job is a comprehensive way to help people gain hands-on experience, significantly boosting their confidence and independence. For example, making coffee, cleaning, and delivering are popular jobs attracting thousands of youngsters with restricted skills to apply. These careers provide young adults with opportunities to socialise and expand their networks, which are notably helpful in building up essential soft skills, for instance: communication, time management and leadership. Moreover, being employed positively contributes to financial stability, enabling young people to afford necessities such as accommodation and food. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that tertiary education is more beneficial for students due to the importance of university degrees in today’s modern world. Higher levels of learning offer a wide range of theoretical and practical knowledge, which are necessary and valuable for some specific professionals. For instance, it is compulsory to have an academic qualification when working as a lawyer, a doctor and a teacher. Additionally, unlike those with a lower level of education attainment, university graduates often receive a higher chance to access a variety of high-paid jobs with further development. An ordinary worker cannot be a restaurant manager without a relevant degree because the position requires a profound understanding of this field, like awareness of nutrition and health and first aids skills, which may only be accomplished at tertiary levels. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people should contemplate opting for higher education due to various positives that make them a better future.",

        "essay": "In recent times, couple prefer to start the journey of Parenthood when they are older and matured to carry the responsibilities of parenting, as this is good for the well-being of children since they would have gathered most experience and finance needed in talking care of their kids. Therefore, the advantages supersede the drawbacks. Albeit, giving birth at older age could result in some complications such as neonatal defects, preeclampsia  etc which could be detrimental to both maternal and neonatal health.\r\n\r\nAs humans, the more we grow,  the more we learn most especially after watching our parents for several years taking care of our younger ones. With this, we must have acquired all the experiences needed in good child upbringing which in turn will shapen this children to the right path in life.

        "prompt": "Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?",
        "essay": "In this technological era, education has become a crucial part of the lives of students as it leads them to various best career opportunities. There are numerous reasons due to which it has become hard for the youth to concentrate on their study at their education institutes. Some of them are engagement in social media and household financial situations. This essay will discuss the reasons and solutions respectively in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n                    To begin with, they'reare  a lot of things responsible for the lack of concentration of students at their centre of education. One of them is the increase in the amount of time for using technological devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops and computers. Youngsters attending academies, spend most of their time using technological devices to remain active on social media and they have become habitual of it. Due to this interest in social platforms, they can not give proper time to their study which results in a lack of concentration. Moreover, Some students belong to middle-class families where they can not spend too much for paying their tuition fees. For instance, in order to save money for paying academic expenses, a lot of students do part-timetime and full-timetime jobs that affect  their studies a lot as they are not active enough in the morning at their college due to late night shift.\r\n\r\n          In addition to that, in order to enhance the focus of students at their educational institutions, parents should pay attention to them and help them spend their whole day  toaccording a timetable so that they can give sufficient time to their academic activities. Furthermore, youngsters attending educational institutes must get themselves involved in other curriculum activities at their schools and get highest grades so that they can get a scholarship for paying their tuition fee and they would not have to work overtime.\r\n\r\n            In conclusion, no doubt, there are numerous factors behind the lack of concentration of students in their study but by taking necessary steps this problem could be overcome.",

        "essay": "With the comfort provided by modern technologies, People all around the world, whether young or adults are suffering from obesity, which indeed is a serious concern. This essay will discuss some of the reasons behind such a growing unhealthy phenomenon and the ways it can be conquered over.\r\n\r\n  Firstly, With the rise of machines and technological advancements around us, all manual work is now being replaced by machines more and more, so the tasks that earlier needed human physical effort, can now be done with just the push of a button, which is leading to a sedentary lifestyle and hence due to the loss of movements and physical exercises , it is turning them obese. People can get over it, by ensuring that they are involved in some form of body movements and workouts, every single day and it should be part of their daily routine. For example, they can make a daily habit to go out for jogging and also keep a watch on the number of calories consumed and lost per day. Unless an appropriate amount of workout is being done to burn out these accumulated fats, it will lead to over-weightedness, which is the root cause of diabetes, high blood pressure and many cardiovascular diseases. \r\n\r\n  Secondly, People nowadays, are relying more on fast foods and due importance is just given to the taste of food, rather than a high amount of fats and calories that they are infusing in their body. To quote an example, Oily and deep-fried food like fries and burger, and beverages like Coke, sold by biggest fast-food chains like McDonald's and KFC are very unhealthy, and though many of us are aware of the same, yet still choose to dine on these.  One should replace these fatty and unhealthy edibles with fruits, cereals, vegetables and other organic edibles. Home-made fresh food should be preferred over-packaged ones, sold in the market, with lots of chemical preservatives.  \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the reasons for obesity are simple and well-known and can be attributed to the excess amount of fats consumption, without burning it out, enough. We can get rid of obesity by ensuring a healthy lifestyle, consuming a calorie-free or at least calorie-conscious diet, embracing organic fresh food in our daily meal and getting rid of junk food.",

        "essay": "Television is more commonly viewed at homes and at different places. Although certain individual think that teenager must not view television as it is bad. Whereas, opponent think it is useful for teenagers. In my opinion, I completely support the later notion because it enhances their learning.\r\nOn the one hand, People are thinking that television is beneficial to students because it improve learning and I agree. Often teachers in the school are using traditional methods of teaching using workbooks and explaining entire class. There are some student who are smart and are comfortable in learning and there are other who finds difficulty in understanding the concept in a few minutes for them in today's world they are plethora of education program broadcasted on the television. Where they can view their topic subject and learn throughout which was incomplete in the classroom. For instance, In India, There are various channels available where they telecast live class for different grades and by watching it again juvenile can complete the understanding. \r\nOn the other hand, Individuals believe allowing children to see television has negative impact on students because of violence programs. Now a day’s program available on various television platforms is uncensored, Films for adults are available on various movie channels and in addition there are on-going wars in various parts of the world. All the news channels are reporting live from this war tone zone. The teenager must not be offered to view as this can have a bad effect on their mental health. Hence this is not preferable for children viewing.  For instance, In USA mall shooting last year, the adolescent was radicalized by watching various news on television and hence he takes on a weapon to kill people. This was because of watching the news.\r\nIn conclusion, while people vary in their opinions. I strongly agree in allowing children to view learning program on the television. Young brain is a fast learner hence parents must ensure that they are cautiously while watching any programs together with the children.",

        "prompt": "Some people think that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way to improve public health, but others believe that it has little effects and we need other measures to improve it.\r\nDiscuss both views and give you opinion.",
        "essay": "It is worth noting that health problems are haunting the general public, both physically and mentally. Though many assert that installing more sports equipment could tackle this issue, others, however, advocate that we should find other solutions. I concur with the view that governments and colossal organizations together should take more responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there is no doubt that constructing extra sports facilities could enable citizens to do more physical exercise, hence, leading to a healthy lifestyle. With the increasing pace of life, modern city dwellers’ schedules are largely occupied by sizeable workloads, they often need to do overtime or do shifts even at the weekends, making doing sports extremely time-consuming. Had more gyms been introduced, folks would have been given more access to exercising.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is fair to say that more efforts should be made in order to improve folks’ physical health and mental well-being. Despite sports activities, other aspects with respect to public health, namely food security, air pollution and waste disposal, should also be addressed fundamentally. For instance, the higher prices of sugary foods could refrain people’s purchase desire, giving rise to fewer sweet food lovers and accordingly declining the overweight population in the long run.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, I strongly believe that authorities should make more efforts to ensure our people can enjoy a good health condition. This is because only the entities like governments and colossal organizations have the power to implement large health projects. For example, they could introduce mandated control on the scale of trans-fat foods or ask factories or education institutions to provide better and cheaper access to nutritious foods, therefore boosting citizens’ fitness.\r\n\r\nIn summary, from what has been discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that in order to improve people’s physical health and mental well-being, introducing sports infrastructures alone is not efficient, thus more contribution from authorities and other entities is needed.",

        "essay": "The history of a house or a building can be fascinating, sometimes daunting or even mesmerising at times if we try to delve into it. For some people, learning about the history of the houses, in which they live, is utterly important for various reasons. This essay attempts to outline some of those possible reasons for this and a couple of methods to research this.\r\n\r\nThe first possible reason for many to become inquisitive about the past of their houses could be that they actually want to find a connection, if any, between themselves and the buildings. Such connections, or lack thereof, could actually provide an insight to them as to whether those buildings contained anything “unique” at some stages of their existence that would make them- the people that is – feel “special” among the others, or “different” from the rest of the crowds in their neighbourhoods. After all, I think that it feels really good to remain at the centre of attention every now and then.\r\n\r\nSome people would be interested to learn about the history of their buildings, especially how they were built, or what kinds of materials were used to construct them because they want to make sure that the buildings are safe enough for living. After all, nobody would want to put their lives at risk by choosing to live in a “weak” building that was built with some “unreliable” materials about a century ago! \r\n\r\nBut, for whatever reasons that they want to learn about the history of their buildings, it is always better that they ask the locals first to get their information about the former residents of their houses. They could also contact the local municipality or the concerned local authority who could apprise them about how the buildings were made. Finally, people could also visit a local library or the authority that keeps the information about old buildings, to learn about the history of buildings in their respective areas. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, people are becoming more and more interested in the history of their houses primarily to find a unique feature of it to feel special or to learn about the architectural style and safety features of the house. They can contact local residents, municipality offices and the library to do the research work required to find the history of their houses.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, the cost of homes is increasing at an alarming rate. The apartments are a  basic necessity for individuals, the governments should give free accommodation for each and everyone who can not bear it. Personally, I completely agree with this standpoint because it benefits both individuals and society as a whole.\r\n\r\nAlthough if everyone owns a house, people have more money to spend on other things. Thus, they will buy new clothes, increase  disposable income and they will spend on luxurious items but in fact, the population will change the product more often than in their life. The result of higher spending would lead to inflation in the economy.\r\n\r\nBut we must observe realistically that the government collects taxes from the citizens of the country. So the responsibility lies in officials to take care of the individuals who have been living and working in these countries and make sure nobody is left homeless. They should build  new buildings to accommodate people who cannot afford such  expensive properties. When they do that, there will be a lot of benefits. For example, this will help to reduce poverty  in the country because instead of spending an enormous amount of money to buy a house , they can use this money for their life to get food. Furthermore, decreasing the crime rate since the poor will do anything to steal valuable things that they are not able to afford.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, with the aforementioned, I totally agree with the idea to build a free house for people who can not afford it is applicable  because of  the benefits it brings.",

Being curious about the home that they live in, is enough by itself to entice people to dig into yesterdays of it. Secondly, if a house-owner decides to get down more about his house, the reason behind it might be persuasion of hope.

        "essay": "Raising children is considered a really challenging task. In fact, there are many external factors that could make the process  more difficult like social media and  society. Hence, it is important to encourage our children to manage their time effectively.  There are several useful exercises for children that would increase and enhance their skills. I believe both  studying and doing physical exercises are important. In the following, we will discuss the great advantages of both studying and doing physical exercises. \r\n\r\nSpending enough period studying  has great advantages for our children. For example, reading about different cultures  would open new areas of thinking. Furthermore, reading novels or books is a great opportunity to enhance their language skills. It is no doubt that learning languages has a great role to increase our communication skills. Moreover, keep studying and learn our children to be more patient and committed. Thus, according to the tremendous advantages of reading, I think  parents should always encourage children to read more and more. \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that doing physical exercises has great results. For instance, playing games enhance  imagination and  creativity. Additionally, playing sports would enhance their health. However, children may prefer doing physical activities rather than studying because it is more exciting and interesting. I think parents should also exploit this option for their children if they did not study enough. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe spending time studying has great benefits thus I totally disagree encourage children to spend less time  studying.

        "essay": "It is widely believed that businesses need to have public responsibilities. While generating profit is the top priority for each company, I agree that they should also conduct their business in a socially responsible manner.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, profit maximisation by corporations may have certain societal benefits. The more profits a business earns, the more taxes it pays to the government. For example, the authorities may have more revenue to spend in the fields, including education and health care, which improves the quality of life of the whole community. Corporations can grow their business by reaching huge earnings to expand new job opportunities within the community. However, Corporations must first maintain financial stability in order to accomplish those.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are compelling reasons why corporations should recognise their social duties. The first reason is that their activities affect the environment, increasing the number of pollution, which in turn drives global warming, leading to many far-reaching consequences. For instance, they cause natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and habitat loss, worse than even threatening the lives of animals. Next, another reason is that companies contribute to the welfare of society and the environment, are received a positive view from consumers. For example, Starbucks Corporation purchases Fair Trade Certified ingredients and manufactures products committed to social responsibility, including sustainability and community welfare. I believe that businesses have social responsibilities that positively impact their profitability.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, while I recognise that profit is the primary premise of business, I believe that all enterprises should deeply consider their social duties.",

First and foremost, with the purpose of investment, the previous records of the properties are essential to the buyers, which may directly decide the potential room for growth in the future. For instance, in the real estate industry, a property with a clean record or a famous previous owner is considered relatively worthy to invest in. Moreover, some buyers may attach importance to the sense of belonging in their future home, especially for new immigrants who landed in a foreign land. The reason why a home with a certain cultural heritage is definitely more appealing to  immigrants from the same background is that it can help them to feel less isolated and more attached feeling to a new territory.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the investigation of the house background, there are two ways available to conduct with. First of all, the main and easiest method is to search online about the address. Many professional websites can provide  full historical records including selling prices, construction dates and so on.

Firstly, people who decide to work immediately after high school can gain real experience rather academic onces, which helps them to become successful. This is because, people who have real experience are more likely to aquire development opportunities like, promotion, high salaries. Secondly, there are several famous businessmena who become successful without univertiy degree.

However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters.

Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.\r\nNevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career.

        "essay": "Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being. There has been an inconclusive debate about whether the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering  advantages to them individually, which I agree with this viewpoint. In this essay, the reasons supporting my idea will be presented in detail. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house. They teach only the subjects that are important for studying in  higher education  and working in the companies, including Math, Science, and languages. Therefore, children cannot rely on themselves in order to produce their own food  and build their own house, Consequently, they need to work in the companies to put food on the table and need to collect money to buy a house. To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA. As a result, the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons  and find it difficult to get jobs. For example, Jack Ma, a founder of Alibaba companies, the second richest person in China, was rejected from many prestigious universities as he could not pass the exams and the interviews. However, nowadays he is one of the most successful persons in the world by establishing the pioneering online shopping website in China. Thus, universities are not beneficial for some people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique.",

        "essay": "In recent years, many people are concerned about the history of the houses or the buildings they live in.  This essay will explore  what might be the case and methods on how  society can find out the information.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are a lot of people who are willing to know the history of the house or building they reside in because they want to make sure wherever they are living is a safe place and suitable for the long term. In addition, they want to know, if there were any crimes that happened in the past or if the place above the cemetery. If so, this could be a dangerous place for the people and kids, as they get scared easily with such things. For example, an article was published in the local newspaper in  Germany, which stated that more and more people are digging out the history of the place they are staying in. As a result, if the place is not suitable, people have the opportunity to leave the place as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods to dig out the history of the place. Firstly, people can interview local residents in town as they have been living in a particular area for a long time, they must have heard some myths as well as experienced some by themselves. Secondly, people can check on the internet about the place and look for any mishappening happened in the past or not. Last but not the least, visit the construction company and ask about how they build and what material  they use.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in many countries, people are interested in knowing the history of that place for various reasons, such as for families' safety and money investment. There are many resources to find out about the past of the place like newspapers, local residents, and the internet.",

        "essay": "Although there is no doubt that volunteering is a crucial part of our life, it is important to consider how society can raise awareness about it. There are numerous people who believe that it is inevitable to start doing work without a pension . Personally, I am a vehement supporter of the idea of volunteering.\r\n\r\nApparently, there are a plethora of boons enrolling in volunteering activities. First off, it helps juveniles improving their future career. This is an advantage because teenagers will gain more experience by dealing with others, and they will be aware of how the market is. For example, according to The Times, 70% of adolescents who were part of unpaid work during their university education are getting promoted faster in their work. In contrast, students who prefer to not enrol in any unpaid job face tremendous pitfalls, not solely in their industry, but also in their personal life. In addition, their communication skills will be dwindled down, which can suppress their interpersonal artistry, time-management techniques and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are abundant programs for student exchange. Participating in such programs can broadening student's horizon because they will be surrounded by cultural diversity. To clarify, the student will be able to learn a new language, new culture and gain experience. As a result, this will impact the youngster's confidence, as well as his self-growth, which will affect substantially his society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having explored both vantage points, I wholeheartedly agree that universities should come up with an idea to include volunteering as a compulsory subject.",

        "essay": "Individuals, who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited. Some people say it is almost nothing they can do. Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.\r\nInitially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.\r\nOn the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.\r\nFinally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control\r\nthe environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually. If the ideas were rejected, they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project.\r\nIn conclusion, individuals can do a lot of options by taking advantage of the internet and the influences are getting larger.",

        "essay": "People have different views about the open areas such as squares and parks play a vital role in towns and cities. This essay will shed some light on why I am on the same page with those who support to this statement.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why it could be argued that public grounds should not be considered as the heart of the cities. The prominent reason is that the number of people migrate to cities increases remarkably due to overpopulation, so these metropolitans do not have available spaces to construct parks or squares. Hong Kong, where inhabitants even do not possess enough places for establishing accommodation, can be taken as an object lesson. Besides, the national authorities should expend the budget on other prospects such as healthcare, education and transportation systems instead of open spaces. \r\n\r\nAlthough the drawbacks of huge spaces are inevitable, their advantages are more significant. Firstly, public places are the ideal places for local citizens improving their well-being and lifting up their spirit. Particularly, residents tend to have stroll around these places to release stressful things after their hectic daily schedules, which can do wonder for them to recharge the battery. Secondly, the deterioration of air quality becomes an alarming trend in cities, so green regions such as parks are able to contribute to the environmental protection by diminishing the amount of greenhouse gases. Moreover, squares also preserve historical value that boosts the tourism industry through attracting visitors flock into this area annually. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I personally support that public places brings more benefits for people and eco-systems that outweigh their demerits.",

It is said that people in the 21st century will have much more leisure time than before. I will delve to explain with sufficient details according to my own experience and also providing specific examples to this statement in the following passage.\r\n\r\nFirstly, as well known, Technology is the symbol of advance produce. For example, machines can replace many jobs that people did by hand in the 20th century. Besides, the advanced information communication technology can contribute to people’s remote cooperation work and conferences quickly.

Although some aspects of computer games could be beneficial for children, other sides of these games are harmful.\r\nSome of the people believe that there are several reasons why video games are not suitable for young ages. There are various types of game which can addict the children. First introduced in many years ago by the development of electrical devices, it appears that vast number of children prefer to stay at home for playing video games rather than practicing physical activities such as football and swimming. In addition, one of the main problems with internal computer games is that children suffer from physical and mental disorders.

Moreover, specialists state that one-way communication with screen leads to depression and sense of loneliness. \r\nThere are other groups of people argue that video games have positive consequences for their children. They claim that juveniles without any sibling who are alone in home can be amused by the help computer games.

        "essay": "For over the last two or three decades, environmental degradation is a major world problem. Mankind activities are being put the ecosystem in a worse condition compared to the past. In this essay, I will look at the reasons for this and propose some solutions.\r\n\r\nInitially, air pollution has deteriorated as time goes by since we as a human mostly drive our own cars because of their convenience and deliberately make conurbations cover by clouds of pollution all the time. As proven by statistics, vehicles exhaust fumes in an enormous amount and it rises into the atmosphere which makes the condition insurmountable. For instance, most cars on roads are transported by one passenger ;therefore, if these drivers utilized public vehicles, this would diminish the amount of pollution. To tackle this problem, the government should enhance taxes on fuel as well as launch several campaigns to enthuse citizens about public transport vehicles. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the majority of factories are working hard to present all demands. It means they burn fossil fuels as high as they can and as a result, emits greenhouse gases into the globe whereas this amount was very low in the past. In addition, these harmful gases contribute to global warming along with melting the polar Ice cap and it happens because of nations' materialistic view. For instance, my cousin has several newly bought outfits that she never wears most of them. A solution is for the power to put a ban on burning high amounts of fossil fuels by factories along with encouraging communities to recyclable objects rather than new ones. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, air pollution is getting worse and worse, and unless we preclude this devastating situation from continuing by way of using public transport systems and paying attention to recycling schemes to conserve our planet.

As a result, they must catch up with the news every day. Furthermore, building a good personal habit of reading the news has tremendous benefits.

        "essay": "In this era of smart technology some people are concerned that sooner or later the artificially\r\nintelligent programs and machines will take care of all the jobs which are now done by humans. In this context, I believe, on one hand, not all but a big portion of the jobs will be done by artificially enhanced machines, on the other hand, lots of new jobs will be created simultaneously that requires human touch. This essay will discuss why all the jobs will not be taken over by robots.\r\n\r\nThe robots or computer programs will mostly replace the repetitive and structured jobs. Jobs such as data entry, listing and filing office works, order fulfilling, answering calls, creating work schedules etc. non-decision making and mundane, but very structured jobs will be replaced by machines to reduce cost and enhance productivity. For instance, Amazon UK has created several smart retail stores without any cashier by making the payment completely online and automated. Hence, artificially intelligent machines will hopefully take care of these unskilled to semi-skilled jobs that do not demand any strategic decision making or complex thought process.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are still so many jobs that demands emotional intelligence that only a human being can provide. To accomplish numerous jobs human touches, such as using gut feeling or intuition to make decisions, interpersonal skills, negotiation skills and other emotional attributes are needed that cannot be completed by robots. For example, to convince a client to close a business deal in good terms needs a physical human being, where good interpersonal skills and some specific emotional intelligence come in play which the machines would never be able to replace. Therefore, many new jobs will be created in future, which will need more human feelings and emotions to get the works done properly.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe, on one hand, many routine and too much repetitive jobs will be lost to the robots. While a lot of other jobs are there and many more will be created where a human participation and emotional intellect are a paramount to get it done.",

A number of residents believe that continue to study at university or college will support students easily to have a prosperous career in the future, whereas others believe that find a career after school is better.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why people have a tendency to keep on training at a higher level. The convincing explanation is that people consider the provision of more knowledge about their major as a first stepping-stone on the path to find a well-paid job in their Specialty. For example, students, who choose economics will be taught all appropriate academic knowledge of development economics, domestic and foreign economic. Furthermore, tertiary education will provide graduate students with their bachelor’s, which the employer used to evaluate them. They argue that due to rising competition in the job, seeking higher education is mandatory\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the opinion that working straight after senior high school is beneficial in some ways. The most obvious reason is that people will work early and have a long time for a work than friends with peers that provide them favourable to do nominated a higher position.

        "essay": "It is generally acknowledged that, in today's modern cities, the already high and increasing traffic volume is a major concern for most residents. And the demand for a solution is equally on the rise. Then, what are the causes of this, and what actions can be carried out by the town halls to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let us dive into the main reason leading to this situation, which is the huge immigration that these metropolises have been experiencing during recent decades. Unfortunately, the steep growth of major urban areas was not correctly planned by the administrations, thus an important lack of investment in public infrastructure exists today. Additionally, centralization policies and inadequate communal transportation exacerbate the problem, forcing those who do not live in the city centre to commute by car.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, the opinion that raising the investment in bus and metro lines is the most efficient way to deal with this situation is commonly shared by most experts. Several studies carried out by UPC in Barcelona, show that were the unfinished new underground lines working nowadays, Barcelona's car volume would experience a drop of nearly 25%. More than enough to considerably reduce jams that occur during peak hours and significantly grow the overall street flow.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, if major urban areas improved their public transportation budget, they would experience a substantial drop in traffic volume.

I disagree with this opinion and possible arguments will be discussed below.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, to begin with, the main reason why this idea is not right is that we have opportunities to intervene and prevent further progression of this tendency. This is because of the fact that not only are there developments in technologies but also scientists and ecologists develop new ways of fighting. Therefore, if we have a chance to change the situation it seems extremely incorrect to ignore the problem. For example, recent research has shown that the introduction of pollution permits in Ukraine has shown outstanding results and pollution was decraesed by 20%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, another evidence why people should try to prevent climate change is that it may get extremely worse so the Earth may become uninhabitable. The major reason for such a thought is that climate deteriorates in a geometric progression and without appropriate measures this issue may become inevitable. Hence, the whole process of global climate change may accelerate and we will not be able to slow down it in the future.\r\n\r\nEventually, to conclude, I disagree with the opinion that humans just need to find a way t olive with environmental problems, firstly, since there areworking technologies which can at least slow sown the whole process and, secondly, because without intervention the situation may get extremely worse in the nearest future.",

        "essay": "There is a considerable debate over the controversial topic of whether economic growth should be motivated or terminated. While the supporters claim that only a healthy financial system can erase starvations and impoverishment, the opposition asserts that by chasing materialism, we are much more likely to see pricey costs imposed on the environment, putting our future in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, concentrating on rising gross domestic products seems to be the single efficient approach to alleviate  extreme poverty and hunger. First and indisputably, only if they have a sufficient income from employment will the impoverished be able to afford decent meals on a daily basis. By reducing the tax burden and liberalizing the labour market, the government would attract numerous international corporates and encourage the small or medium-sized enterprises to thrive, generating thousands of job opportunities for the unoccupied. Second, the authority of a prosperous nation would have the financial power needed to properly provide free health public services, ensure food security and keep funding for education investment, which are all crucial for the extremely low-income class to have the chance to gradually step out of penury in the long run. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is also supposed that the current pace of global economic development is so devastating for the environment that it is totally understandable if it is required to be restrained. Seeking for maximizing the real output, the human race is currently facing countless environmental issues. For example, the escalated consumption of mass-produced products leads to an unimaginable amount of plastic directly dumped into the sea, killing millions of marines and sabotaging ocean ecosystems. Besides, deforestation for farming to develop agriculture is causing severe loss of animals’ natural habitats, posing serious extinction threats to endangered creatures. Last but not least, industrialization is often associated with burning a massive amount of fossil fuels, meaning that not only natural resources would be drained pretty soon, but also global warming leading to volatile weather issues that would worsen than ever due to the enormous CO2 emission.\r\n\r\nIn short, acknowledging the strong arguments of both viewpoints, I suppose that a policy focusing on generating wealth is crucial to ease the world’s hunger and poverty.

Accumulating skills and experience in a specific area allows people to become experts in this subject and be amply rewarded. For instance, most football stars have never gone to university.

Personally, I completely agree with this opinion and this essay will elaborate on several reasons why increasing the cost of fuel is able to save the Earth from environmental problems.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Higher fuel prices will force people to switch to environmentally friendly transportation mode. As travel by private vehicles such as cars or motorcycles become more expensive, people that work in nearby offices from their home will tend to commute by foot or bicycles to save more money. Similarly, employees that work in offices located far away from their home will shift to public transportation like buses or trains. As a result, less and less emission is produced from commuting, which will save the world from climate changes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the higher cost of aviation fuel makes travel by plane more expensive than previously. Planes emit a lot of pollution that leads to warmer Earth temperature, but many people prefer using planes even for short distance travels that are accessible for land mode transportation. It means people can use green transportation mode like electric trains and cars that are able to get electricity from solar panels. Expensive plane tickets will make people tend to use these electric transportation for short distance trips. Resulting in less pollution emitted from planes to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that expensive fuel will save our Earth from environmental problems.

        "prompt": "The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "There are those who think that deciding stricter punishments against accidents on pathways is only a method to reduce car crimes. In my opinion, I partially disagree with this view, and the reason will be elaborated in enlisted paragraphs. \r\n\r\nFirstly, let us think about a beneficial point of this change. It is the fact that if the punishment becomes harder than in the past, car drivers would beware how to drive more, and it will generate some positive effects on walkers and bikers. For instance, Japanese government enacted more severe laws against car accident in 2018, and the number of the accidents diminished from 2018 to 2020, and this is because many drives have to concentrate on driving to avoid expensive payment. Hence, harsh rules would evoke the individuals’ caution more. \r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps this should not be the case. After all, although administers decide some strict penalties for drivers’ offences, many people would be used to drive under the severe guidelines. Furthermore, they may obtain nervous and anxiety from the rules, and it would produce more accidents. According to the dissertation done in 2020, one of the main reasons of the crimes on pathways is stress from driving and other things. In addition, they would drive slower, and it triggers traffic congestion, then the traffic jam generates adverse impacts on the citizens who used road. Thus, harsh penalties would make an increase of vehicle crimes. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though making more strict punishments has the advantage, there are more disadvantages than the positive point. Therefore, I slightly disagree with this statement.",

        "essay": "Centuries ago when people discovered land and islands they did affect negatively the biodiversity of the planet. Even now, industrialisation, deforestation and urbanization developments have a huge impact on various species of animals and plants, leading to endangerment and disappearance. Some think that those effects are irreversible and can not be improved, whereas others believe that taking any measures may assist with preserving the remaining ones. I strongly believe that it is possible to keep them alive and save endangered organisms at least. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is not late to reconsider humans' priorities and decisions,before decisively ruining the ecosystem by diminishing them. There are possible ways of solving this issue, which commences from intentions and faith that every inhabitant of the earth should have. Moreover, the government plays a big role in tackling it, by imposing strict laws in order to combat illegal logging and the deleterious effects of agricultural practices. Also, there should be organised organisations or groups of people who help to preserve creatures and plants from poaching and trampling. Hence, everyone must exert influence on the local environment and its dwellers. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is can be denied that a plethora of bio-organisms is fading away as humans do not stop using natural resources incessantly and litter shelters of exotic types of wild animals or plants. Therefore, believers claim that the vital majority of diverseness already has gone and the minority of those will become extinct in 2-3 decades. This will be accurate, for example by 2050 the creatures such as the tiger, koala, polar bear and even elephant will extinct from our planet. Furthermore, if humans do not halt dumping waste,oil or leftovers, sea creatures are suffering and it may lead to another tragedy. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate,human activities damaged the planet including the animal and plant species. However, it seems to me that humanity can overcome this challenge by working together towards preserving the rest of the species.",

        "prompt": "In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find job after graduation. What peoblem do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and society? Give reasons and make suggestion.",
        "essay": "Youth unemployment is an ongoing issue that's continually growing. As more young people are opting out of school and lack the qualifications for a career after graduation, this is posing a greater threat to society and towards the individuals. The significant shortcomings for both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay. \r\n\r\nPerceivably, the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden. It's evidently clear that dropping out of school leads to a lack of education qualification which plays a vital role in applying for professional careers. Therefore, by having no active income, these individuals have no choice but to depend on their family and friends for financial assistance. Moreover, such actions could potentially persuade younger individuals to turn towards the life of criminals. Thus, government interventions will be necessary by providing free educational courses and offering a wide variety of career options available for students with low or no educational qualifications. \r\n\r\nIn addition, youth unemployment can only bring tremendous amounts of issues to society. Without younger professionals entering the workforce, the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues. As the number of new recruits entering the workforce decreases, the workload for existing employees will gradually increase, leading to morale issues between employees. Moreover, such a phenomenon will also lead to lower revenues generated by businesses which eventually results in economic downfall. Thus, hiring standards by organisations should be lowered to consider applicants with lower educational qualifications. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the shortcomings of youth unemployment for both young people and society are tremendous. Such a phenomenon can be resolved by government intervention and effort from organisations to lower hiring standards to give every applicant a chance despite their educational background.",

This passage will explain why the houses' history is worthy of research and how the research can be made.  \r\n\r\nThe reasons, for which it is valuable to research houses' history,  vary.  For example, when a family bought an old house that has come across many different owners, there might be some safety problems in the house that no one knows them all.  Besides this, even a house looks still in great condition after going through a long time, people still may find out some potential value from its history, and that is how some historic attractions have been found as the old places of some celebrities.\r\n\r\nTo figure out the history of people's own houses, there are many accessible and effective resources that can help.

If someone is not adept at using the internet or want to kill two birds with one rock, talking to the neighbours and local elder people is a good way that also helps a newcomer to merge into the community. Furthermore, the official records of the legal changes of the houses are usually available in the local courthouses. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it could be interesting and valuable to trace the history of your house in some conditions.

        "essay": "Artificial intelligence and its impact on employment is increasingly becoming a hot topic of debate. While a number of people believe that artificially intelligent robots will replace humans to do all jobs in the long term, there are many who have opposing views. This essay will argue that eventually, most jobs will indeed be done by robots powered by artificial intelligence although not all jobs as believed by some.\r\n\r\nAround the world, giant strides have been made with regards to the capacity of artificial intelligent robots to carry out complex tasks typically done by humans in industries like manufacturing, shipping and information technology. These robots are consistently demonstrating higher efficiency levels with cheaper overhead costs than their human counterparts, causing many industry leaders to cut down on their human workforce in favour of adopting robotic systems. For example, Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, recently announced plans to lay off 20% of its workforce as well as plans to build two new factories across North America that will be fully operated using robots powered by artificial intelligence. Many more of such announcements are expected in the coming decades, corroborating the belief that human beings will be made redundant as more artificially intelligent robots replace them at their jobs. \r\n\r\nHowever, not all occupations can be efficiently done by these robots. Professions such as prostitution, policing, marketing and customer service require human factors such as empathy and emotions to be delivered efficiently. For instance, studies show that many customers prefer to interact with a human customer service agent over the phone to help resolve their problems, rather than interact with a non-human system. To sum it up, artificial intelligence may never be able to replicate the human factors listed and as such cannot perform tasks that require these factors. \r\n\r\nThis essay has argued that artificial intelligence robots will eventually be able to do most jobs and also touched on the fact that not all jobs can be done by these robots. In my opinion, a lot of jobs will be done by robots in the long-term but not all jobs.",

        "prompt": "The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?",
        "essay": "In the last few decades, our society has witnessed the rise of the industrial revolution around the world, which in turn leads to the excessive mass production of goods growing beyond consumer demand. As a social and economic phenomena, it has had several impacts on the natural world and the living conditions of humankind. In this essay, I will discuss the main causes that give rise to the overproduction of goods and offer some measures to tackle this problem.\r\nThe root of an excessive supply of products lies within the evolution of human society itself. Among many possible reasons that cause the glut of goods, consumerism is considered to be the main culprit. Because of the belief that certain merchandise do not hold the same value anymore when it is out of style, in tandem with the ever-increasing appearance of advertisement in every household, modern citizens are convinced to believe that they must stay up to date with the ongoing trends by purchasing new products even though their old ones still function well. Recent researches have shown that today’s people have the tendency to buy the newest and the most fashionable smartphone models in the marketplace, despise the fact that their current mobile phone is not out of date yet. Another trend of human society that has helped create the excess of supply is the planned obsolescence. Modern companies intentionally design their products to be out of use after a short span of time such as clothes, shoes or smartphone batteries and thus force the costumers to come back to buy new ones. As a result, the two above reasons encourage people to keep buying unnecessarily new merchandise and therefore start the chain of overproduction. In the end, for the industrial production requires different resources which come from the natural world, the oversupply will eventually lead to environmental degradation, for example the unrestrained development of pulp and paper industry will lead to deforestation or the overfishing of seafood industry will result in the loss of marine life.\r\nIn response to solve this increasing adverse effect, some viable solutions must put forward. Firstly, the government should implement a law to ban manufacturers to plan the failure of their goods and encourage them to produce more durable products, so consumers do not have to replace their bought products too frequently. Secondly, the media should promote environmental programs that raise awareness of overconsumption and overproduction. For example, a tv program that shows the harmful effects of excessive unsustainable production on ecosystem health will inspire people to buy less and not contribute to the oversupply of goods. Once the buyers are aware of how their shopping habit can have serious impacts on the environment and decide to end this toxic practice, the excess of supply will not be a problem anymore.\r\nIn conclusion, it must be said that the overabundance of products is a contentious topic with no easy answers. However, in my mind, the most effective solutions would be to encourage the consumers to do shopping responsibly by not buying goods for unnecessary trends. It is not unrealistic to expect that raising consumers’ awareness will help reduce the increase of producing goods in the impending future.",

I strongly believe that government officials must put their energy into tackling the toxicity on the air and households need because of two reasons which are locally and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why I believe that government have to solve the problem of toxicity in the air and their voter’s housing is that they have a local duty toward citizen which means that they are obliged to fdsa these needs. Furthermore, countries should have gone after citizen needs and one of the fundamental needs fds to live in an area where the air is clean and to have a place to sleep. Despite the fact, that government’s officials are citizens at the end.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why I think that countries need to solve any problem related to the environment and household so because they have an international duty toward their citizens. Obviously, most of the countries are in the United Nations and to be member countries have to agree to the United Nation’s rule. In fact, most of the rules are talking about what are  human needs such – housing, justice, safety, and health -; therefore, all countries must offer these needs to their citizen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely admit that governments must solve any problem related to the environment and household; apparently, this is because they have local and international obligations.

In order to solve these issues the person should sleep well and the support of family is essential.\r\n\r\nThere are many difficulties related to night shift jobs, one of them is improper sleep. To elucidate, our body is habitual with working on the day shift and sleep at night. By doing such our body remains fit and fine. However, if a person is working during the night, he or she will face the issue of improper sleep. As a result, the person gets irritated and behave unusually, and sometimes, gets depressed and anxiety. For instance, in an article in the Times of India revealed that in Mumbai, 55% of employees who are working night shift get more irritating than those who are working in day shifts. To resolve this issue, the person should sleep at least 8-10 hours after returning from work. This will make the person less irritation, more relax and fit.\r\n\r\nAnother problem related to this working style is that the employee might contact with many diseases. It is scientifically proven that if the person is working around the clock, he or she will get contacted with many harmful diseases, such as cardiovascular disorder, gastrointestinal problems, and cancer. For instance, the WHO published in the report in January 2020 that patients that are infected with cancer, among them 45% are due to working at night shift. In order to solve this problem, there should be the support of the family who allows the person to take a good sleep after returning from the work and give a good amount of food so that such diseases are not there.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, employing in the night shift work, there are many problems associated with this, such as lack of sleep and infect with many diseases.

        "essay": "Inveigled by their aroma and the gut’s responsive bleat, people today have been completely ensnared by their favourite fast-food treat. However, this transient decoy comes with its ramifications. The primary causative effect that it causes is a fallacious and unhealthy body mass index of people owing to their obesity. To this, some people peddle forth to increase the selling prices of such fast-food products causing health hazards. However, I would differ from the viewpoint presented. In the subsequent paragraphs, I shall propound my views on the issue. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, as is rife, modernization has caused and paved the way for the cornered sections of the society to be educated, empowered, and employable, and with it, more and more working professionals have come along. With more people entangled in their daily workloads, lesser emphasis has thus naturally been on cooking the meals at home, and more so, the hoopla of managing both has certainly been overwhelming and making one feel work like a trojan. In such a “click and flick” era where a significant number of people may approach their fast-food outlets easily, simply putting a higher price quotation couldn’t ever curb people from consuming and feasting on junk food. More so, as is found in a survey, people falling in the bracket of the upper class with an above-average income, are found to be the steadfast consumers of such packaged and unhealthy meals. Hence, as is pretty comprehensible, raising the prices of these eatables wouldn’t make much of a dent in the pockets of people who may afford it easily. \r\n\r\nThe wages of people in concomitance to what they could frugally spend would be negligible, even after upheaving the taxes on such edible items. The striking need of the hour is to make people more aware of the cataclysmic causes of having such food that might render them extremely unhealthy and frail. Acknowledging people with the detrimental corollary and pernicious eventualities of having an imbalanced diet and a decrepit BMI may keep them alarmed and watchful of what they are being served or choose to be served with to eat.

In order to provide welfare of these people, countries need to use more energy and materials from the environment. Therefore the environment cannot replace these losses. Having said that economic growth and emerging new technology prompt countries to decline the damage of environment like using the renewable energy and materials with the lowest hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, economic development and new technology can either eliminate hunger and poverty or increase the damage of environment in terms of overpopulation.

        "essay": "Nowadays it seems that few people are willing to dedicate time to hobbies and pastimes. This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.\r\nFirst, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.\r\nAlso, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.\r\nThese phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find \"Pride and Prejudice\" unfamiliar, and \"Romeo and Juliet\" alien to them.\r\nPeople losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.\r\nTo sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football.

Personally, I believe that the events have beneficial impacts on a nation.\r\n    Advocates of the former view might assert that spending on sporting events could hurt countries’ economies. Staging the international sporting events would incur enormous expenses, to the detriment of the host nations’ budgets.  The expenditure on enhancing the infrastructure and capacity of their stadiums, implementing higher levels of security, and hiring performance artists is so significant that hardly can poverty-stricken nations afford it. For example, South Africa spent billions of dollars hosting the 2010 World Cup and then drowned in debt. Instead, those budgets should have been expended on addressing the physiological needs such as improving the standard of living and eliminating starvation.\r\n    However, I support the view that nations might reap a multiplicity of benefits from staging those sporting events. Firstly, A wide range of employment opportunities are available during years of planning and investment, and this will contribute to a decrease in unemployment. Secondly,  enthusiasm and excitement are an indispensable part of these events; it is clear from this emotional boost that people of the host nations will experience a drastic improvement in their life satisfaction.

It could be really quality time with their mates and they could get new skills. And after that youngsters make their own decision. If I was told in my high school that it is possible to do, I would definitely take this opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there is the objective advantage requiring teens to work for the community without paying, I suppose that we need to give them a choice and decide by themselves how to spend their free time.",

The following content will list the reasons.\r\n\r\nTeamwork and communication are crucial factors in sports. In certain sports, such as football, basketball and baseball, they need not only personal ability but also whole team's strategy. For example, while planning the strategy, children must have a communication and interaction between each other. As a result, kids will learn how to obtain their goal by team cooperation over the period. In addition, regularly training can also efficienctly enhance teamwork. For instance, while children spending more time with friends, the relationship between the group will become closer.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the sense of achievement when winning a competition can makes the connection stronger. When children join a game, they need to face enemies who are hard to defeat, as a result, their cooperation will stronger than ever. In addition, as they win the game, the effort of the whole team while they were training will in payback, at the moment, they will pround of themselves and their group, this feeling can definitely raise their sense of teamwork.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the team sports can play an important role for a child to raise their sense of teaamwork, because not only it increase the interaction with other teenagers but also the sense of achievent to join a group can let them know the meaning of teamwork.",

        "essay": "Space explorations have been developed since  the post- modern era and it has made a huge transformationin  the various sectors of the life; however, there remain some disagreements as to whether this  crucial for the country or the funds can be channelized to more pressing issues. I, personally, consider that it is extremely significant for countries to invest in outer space studies to progress further.\r\n First of all, it is an indisputable fact that, many  communication facilities and treatment modalities are originally developed for the space research.  CT scan, for instance, which was used to analysis the picture of  the moon and then, scientist realiased that it can be used in the medical field to study the internal organs. Apart from this, communication sector is the another area which is also benefited tremendously by these researches. By lounching satellites to the space, this had revelutionised the way humen communicate and the information technology. Currently, people can have conversations( face to face and voice) with either relatives or friends on the other side of the world by using mobiles or with the internet.\r\n However, there some people argue that, the amount which has spent can be invested to improve the public infrastructure: hospitals, educational institutions, and transportation facilities. These are the basic requirements need to be provided to the citizens of any country, instead of funding to the  exploration of space. Developing countries, India and China, where a large proportion people lives under poverty, despite this fact, they  allocate a  major portion of income to these research. By contrast, if these nations helped needy people with sufficient amount, they would contribute back to the country.\r\nBy way of conclusion, even though people are differed regarding spending money to conduct space research, I , again reaffirm that it is better, if they could use this for nation building and providing minimum facilitities to the society.",

        "essay": "People now prefer to make a decision to eat nourishments which is good for their health and exercise on a regular basis. Society experiences this trend is due to a couple of reasons and there are a wealth of ways to make them eat healthily and exercise.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the foremost reason is that citizens are aware of several diseases that they could suffer from. People pay more attention to what they eat every day which affects directly their digestive systems. If consuming a large amount of junk food and not practising, inhabitants of all ages can easily get diabetes, problems relating to the immune system or are over-weight. Second, ,adolescents these days are inclined to take good care of their own bodies more than in the past. Teenagers usually go on a diet with a careful selection together with exercising to burn calories and keep fit so that they do not have to worry about body shaming, especially the girls in Korea.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the methods to increase the number of citizens digesting good products and doing more activities are varied. Each household can improve the meals with healthy products following family members’ tastes. This seems to be a matter of individual tastes to modify personal eating habits. In addition, local authorities should launch some campaigns such as running, walking 1 to 5 kilometres and reward to inspire both adults and children to manoeuvre more. For instance, offering discounted tickets can encourage them to attend more and not be lazy to exercise.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are more and more residents who refuse to absorb fast food and get used to exercising. This becomes the trend all over the world owing to the changes in their consciousness and consideration for their bodies.

        "essay": "Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other thinks it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views\r\n\r\nPeople have different views about whether allowing students to evaluate or criticize their teachers. While some argue that this two-way communication in the class could result in disrespect and indiscipline, I believe that this approach could make an improvement in the quality of education systems.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why it can be argued that students who are given permission to assess the teachers could lead to the lack of respect and discipline in the classroom. Firstly, as young students are immature, impulsive and inexperienced, they could easily give negative words to teachers when it comes to controversial issues. For instance, students could give a wrong answer for a Math exercise, but insist that they are right, and this lack of knowledge could make them lose tempered and criticize their teachers. Secondly, the class may be in chaos due to massive numbers of comments. Opinions can vary from students to students, and it is impossible for teachers to find out the best way that satisfies all the students.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that giving students the freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings to teachers could enhance the quality of education. Perhaps the principal reason is that this interaction could boost students’ critical thinking and particularly ensure the level of comprehension. For example, the teachers may teach too fast that students are not able to understand; in this case, thanks to learners’ responses, teachers could adjust their speeds and methods so that students could fully retain the knowledge. Another reason is that this approach could improve teachers’ pedagogical skills. Teachers who do not carefully prepare the content of lessons may provide wrong information, and feedbacks of students could help them find out their mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would contend that encouraging students to judge their teachers could lead to increased educational quality despite the possibility of disrespectful and undisciplined attitudes among students",

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.\r\nFirst and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.\r\nNow, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.\r\nTo sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.",

        "essay": "A discussion on educational parameters has always been permeative and immanent among intellectuals. When it comes to literacy and edification, a certain school of thought peddles the need to educate the scion and younger generation. Contrastingly, significant others say that a major focus and the principal budget should be invested in the education of the person. However, I find myself standing tall with the former viewpoint and consider investing and accentuating both the focus and the capital in the fortification of the younger cohort. In subsequent paragraphs, this essay shall see my thoughts on the topic.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the eminent adage - “The childhood shows the man, as the morning shows the day,” - perspicuously endows the essence of educating children as they are the building blocks of the imminent scenario that shall prevail in the times to come. In that case, diverting the focus or the economic budget that is planned to be bequeathed to the nurturing of the younger minds shall impede the entire agenda and the propitious growth of substantial human resources at the same time. Education is inexorably mandatory. However, when it comes to the educational refinement of the adults, not only do the procedural alignments become pretty arduous, but also time-consuming. Therefore, the point of allocating the major budget to adult information, in accordance with my prudence, is a bit faltering.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as is researched, when we compare the learning ambit of children and adults, it has always been found, as per various reconnoitres, that children outsmart adults when it comes to grasping and retaining countenance. In such a scenario, where the potential scope of laying the herculean foundation for the future can be well established with considerable economic assets, gnawing it off would not contribute to the significance of the development. Therefore, from the tangential tinge of substantial growth, too, it is both providential and prudential to foster the virtues of the buds that would culminate in the inflorescence of the prosperity of a nation.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don’t deny the essence of soft training and coaching of adults, and that the andragogy should as well be seen with punctilio as far as the present developmental strides are concerned, the very thought process to dedicate the lion’s share in favour of adult education,",

Usually, after watching those children-oriented advertisements, they might start pestering their parents to buy the products for them. Consequently, this can create consumerism from an early age. Moreover, businessmen normally hire glamorous, successful people in order to promote their company. Therefore, people are encouraged to buy the products that might not need them at all. This may lead more consumerism in some cases. \r\n\r\n\tTo sum up, existing more advertisement in our daily life has many negative effects.

        "essay": "In this day and age, there are a wide variety of ways to achieve a successful career path. While numerous people believe that attending higher university is the optimal way to reach their career targets, others claim that it is more beneficial to opt for a job or vocational training after high school graduation. In this essay, I will discuss both mentioned views before drawing the conclusion why I lean toward the former. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why finding a job immediately after leaving school is an advantageous means of achieving goals, given that this saves a huge amount of time and money for people. By doing this, young adults do not have to spend as much time as college students in order to be employed and start earning money, since there are a great number of short vocational training courses which enable learners to get a job right after finishing them. As a result, they can still have a successful career without having to make a huge effort and pay a lucrative amount of money for university, as long as they have goals and determination.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is also reasonable to apply for university if one’s aim is to have a good profession, in terms of chances of being employed and better working conditions. The primary reason is that during their college years, they can deepen their knowledge about their chosen fields, as well as acquiring hands-on experiences and soft skills such as team-working and communicating, which makes them more accomplished and have more potential to convince employers. As a result, having an occupation and getting promoted will not be a challenge for them. Additionally, workers that graduate from universities tend to have better working conditions and policies than those who did not attend higher education. For example, an office worker who went to college does not have to work under as extreme conditions as manual workers. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, going to university facilitates the journey to getting a desired career as it supplies students with professional understanding. Nonetheless, going straight to the employment market is also a good way to be successful.",

        "essay": "In recent years, many celebrities are famous because of the glamour and wealth rather than for their accomplishments. While I strongly agree with this statement because of a negative example for teenagers such as influence on children’s life and highly financed usage. Some celebrities' skills might be average even though they are rich and become young people’s idols.\r\n\r\nFirstly, influence on the children’s life in the social media platform. This is because famous people such like actors, actresses, singers, models or sports stars take their picture and video, put it on IG, Facebook and Twitter  regularly, to create more fans. A good example would be Justin Biber, who is rich and famous in the world. Everyday he posts where he goes, sometimes he attends parties, pubs or clubs and he has many tattoos on his body. This message to young people is that they want to be the same as their idol, and many young people get a tattoo on their skin and become bad behavior.\r\n\r\n\tSecondly, highly financial usage is another reason why it is not good for teenagers. The famous people promote many branded accessories for their job, so children want to buy or use and force their parents to buy high quality branded things. For example, HERA Company hired Jenny, who is a very famous Kpop group (BlackPink) member to advertise their latest makeup collection. She is pretty, slim, and smooth skin. And she takes makeup tutorials to use every brush or every shade and lipstick, young people think that is the only way one can look beautiful. The kind of highly paid celebrities have the ability to pay to get what they need, therefore young children are not similar to famous people. \r\n\r\n\tDespite the possibility of children developing their talents, there are far more negative examples for the younger generation.

        "essay": "Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.\r\nOn the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.\r\nOn the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of \"inspiration\" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.\r\nIn summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.",

However, some parents think children should spend more time on academics because that is very important for their future.In my opinion, outdoor activities are more crucial to them as I will discuss both sides in the following essay.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that studying in lectures is important, because that is one of the basic responsibilities of students. For example, in Taiwan,there is an obligate education policy which means it is compulsory for citizens to abide for 12 years of education from elementary school to high school. Moreover,Some students have to go to cram school after class ,this can put a high pressure on students for their study performance. Furthermore,learning knowledge and skills is vital at a young age,because education can be a factor in future development,and is highly correlated with future success in the eyes of some parents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,some parents think exercise is always the priority for their children,due to teenagers growing up very fast in this time period,it is called a” golden time”. After this period, it becomes challenging to influence the physical growth of children,that is the reason why parents should put more emphasis on their health.This includes nutrition, body flexibility, and mental well-being, especially since children may not cope well with excessive academic pressure.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,studying hard in academics and doing outdoor activities are two essential factors and should not be ignored when children are growing up,provided parents can give more balance on both sides, it could be beneficial to their children.",

According to my verdict, the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous, but for short term trying to accommodate is not entirely wrong.\r\nFirstly, unraveling the climate condition caused abundant money and handful of resources, which could be unendurable for developing countries. Moreover, rectifying the environmental issues that caused climate change could be very time-consuming and hectic. Although human survival is directly dependent on climate condition, various life threatening issues are also existed which demand hotfoot solution. For example, the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable. Because of this disease the death rate is 56%, and it is very alarmingly  high than death rate due to climate changes.\r\nVerily, there are other serious issues that need urgent solution, but the idea of not taking measures to control climate hazards is completely outrageous. Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat. For instance, the Forest fires in Australia and many other regions which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals, are the result of extreme climate changes. Legislation and serious measures should be done by government to prevent and rectify drastic climate changes.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.",
        "essay": "In the modern world, the topic of whether a diploma is more crucial than interactional skills or the contrast has been one of the hotly debated topics for a long time. I partly agree with this notion and this essay will try to explore both sides with its vital points. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, from my point of view, many jobs prioritize your certificates or experience in relevant areas. For instance, right at the first round of employment, programmers are required to finish at least a good bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pass. This is because this type of document reflects clearly your level of problem-solving, critical thinking and your knowledge in that field as well. Hence, just being decent in sociability cannot aid you anything in coding or system designing. Moreover, soft skills employers might acquire during their working process, and it is pointless for recruiters to recruit individuals who possess merely social skills. To be more clear, jobs such as programmers, engineers or doctors definitely cannot please their boss by having soft skills. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, having a good skill of communicating with co-workers or with customers can really have a positive influence on  that company or office. Saying thoroughly, employers will start to cooperate with each other and  get along with each other, which will contribute to the growth of the business. Furthermore, it will be easy for them to crack a deal with clients. For instance, I would mention my brother’s own life experience of an organization, where he worked for just 10 months, due to unfriendly and uncooperative behaviour he changed his loaded work. Owing to this reason, having good knowledge without interactional skills can really be a barrier for you, especially when you work in an office or company. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is apt to conclude that although social skills are dispensable for employers, however possessing social skills may help in coordination and individuals will reduce the load of spending too much time on a task",

        "prompt": "Some people think  that in the modern world we are  more dependent on each other, while others believe we have become more independent.\r\n\r\ndiscuss both views and give your opinion",
        "essay": "Some people said that the more the world moves towards modernity, the more people become dependent on each other. However, some people believe that with the modernization of the world, the level of dependence of people on each other will decrease. I agree with the second opinion. In the following paragraphs, I will express my opinion while stating the reasons.\r\n\r\n    On the one hand, it can be said that with the modernization of the world, people become more dependent on each other, in the sense that today many people can easily communicate with each other, and as a result of that dependence is created. With the advancement of technology and the creation of more modern communication tools, as we can see, people can easily communicate with each other. Take today's mobile phones as an example. A person in a foreign country can easily communicate with someone in a fraction of a second; on the other side of the borders, it is easy to communicate with the Internet connection, and as a result, many long-distance relationships are created in which there is naturally dependence. Although I feel that this type of dependence is unrealistic and there is no correct definition of dependence in this concept.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, it can be said that people are more independent than before. Today, with life conditions becoming more complicated, many people spend many hours of their time working, studying, or studying, and as a result, they are less able to spend time with their friends or family. For example, consider a family where both huslabel and wife are forced to work due to high living expenses such as providing housing, food and clothing, and as a result, they can devote less time to being together, and as a result, they become less dependent on each other. In addition, nowadays the concept of independence is very important and many psychologists emphasize independence especially for women and people care more about this aspect of their personality than before. They become completely independent, they especially tend to be financially independent. In fact, in the past, we saw many people around 30 years old or older who still lived with their families and were financially dependent, but today many people in Younger ages are trying to be independent and I believe this trend will continue and we will see more independent people every day.\r\n\r\n    In general, I believe that although modernization with the increase in the level of technology can in some ways make people more dependent than before, but due to reasons such as the complexity of life and the popularization of the concept of independence from a young age, today we see an increase in independent people.",

        "essay": "The aim of my project is to examine what are the most popular film genres among teenagers in Zetland. To achive this goal I found a table considering some revelant opinion polls. In this essay I will describe my findings and express my opinion.\r\n\r\nAccording to the table, Comedy is the most popular film genere (33%), followed by Science fiction (27%). Horror movies were chosen by 18% of respondents and situated in the middle of the table. Action and Others genres are in the bottom of the list making up (13%) and (9%) respectively.\r\n\r\nPredictably, comedy movies are rather more popular then horror ones, The former is almost two times higher then the least. This difference could be explained by obvious fact. Horror movies make people feel stressful and anxious during the watch, instead of comedy films which cause only positive emotions. \r\n\r\nIn any case there are some problems which can arise with watching films and the main one – is vision loss. Of course you would not become blind person after watching films, but your eyes may be seriously damaged by screen which displaying you a film. To avoid this problem you should follow a few simple rules: do not put the screen very close to face, do not watch more than 3 films in a row and do eyes warmup every 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I bielive that films are the biggest influencer among the teenagers in Zetland. Film characters are always become these persons, who teenagers want to be like. That is why essential to make films which show best types of human’s chatacters.",

        "essay": "Schools are more and more essential nowaday with people around the world, especially  with children. Some people belive that the main task of education systems is to transform children into well-educated citizens and employers, rather than to benifit them as individuals. It is disasgreed that this is the main target of shool for children. Analysing the self development of graduates for both their financial abilities and their mental knowledges will prove this.\r\n\r\nFirstly, school will give their learnes about khowledges and skills to meet their job requirements so that they could get job easier. For instance, people who are fresh gradutes could be apply for jobs which has job descriptions same as their khowledges sector at universities, so  they have more chance to be accepted by the company. If they get the jobs, they will have ability to afford their cost of living, then pay taxes for social. Therefore, this make it clear that they are people who take more benifits.\r\n\r\nSecondly, school will give their learnes khowledges to develop the mental health on themselve. For example, kids will be taught ethical lession to become a better children in their families. Moreover, kids also learn survial skills that extremely essential in their life such as swimming, cooking..etc.Thus, it becomes appearant that learnes get more valueable from school than social.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the learners are people who are received more benefit from school than companies or social.

        "essay": "Nowadays, museums have become of great importance and demand amang government and people , and the ideas and works of museums have developed people have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.\r\n\r\nIn the first opinion, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen too much educational contents, so museums often put mere of interesting and enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museume is designed to be visually speatacular, and it may hare interactive or even games as part of its exhibitions. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of an exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means, that the history behind the museum's exhibits need to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that the visitors can listen to detailed information abont the exhibition, this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, cultures, science and many other aspects of life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seem to me that good museums should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educationel experience so that that people can both have fun and learn something\r\n\r\nat the same time.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, there are a lot of environmental problems. Some people believe that children should be educated at the academy rather than at home. This essay will discuss both aspects in detail and will finally conclude why it is better if an individual is trained at home.\r\n\r\nPeople believe that it is necessary for children to be taught at school for multiple reasons. Firstly, children are more serious when they are at th the academy. Since their focus levels are higher they will pay more attention to subtle issues pertaining to the environment. According to a survey conducted in America, seventy-two per cent of the children who claimed that recycling is the most important factor to protect the globe were from non-private schools. It was not until a few months later that the researchers realised that the government had conducted a workshop where novices learnt the significance of recycling. Secondly, there are an uncountable number of activities conducted by schools. The children, consequently, learnt through practical methods.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, many citizens believe that it is better if candidates are taught at home. Therefore, this should not be the responsibility of education boards. Moreover, parents are supposed to be held responsible for inculcating nature-friendly practices such as recycling. To illustrate, if a child sees their parents taking an effort to recycle non-organic compounds, they will automatically pick up similar habits. In addition, a child spends more time at home than at school. As a result, there are more opportunities to implement recycling techniques.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, although it is vital for schools to convey the value of recycling to their students, I strongly believe that learning at home has more advantages. Unfortunately, many children do not take their lessons seriously but if guardians struggle to explain them to their young ones, the idea of recycling will eventually become intuitive.",

        "essay": "While it is considered by some that young pupils should not be handed out assignments by their teachers, others strongly believe they are crucial for educational purposes. I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.\r\nIn regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.\r\nBy contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.\r\nIn conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only.",

        "essay": "In recent times,  climate change has become the talk of the town. People are discussing  the climate change more often than ever. Currently, the earth temperature is increasing by more than 3 degrees on an annual basis due to shifts in weather. To keep a check on this rapid temperature change, governments and organisations across the globe are putting in cummulative efforts. While this change has brought a concern to authorities, it has proven to be advantageous for many corporates in many business aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost,  this climate change has added an extra burden on the finances of many global companies. Many corporates have been increasing their amount of Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) towards this climate change. For instance, in recent report by Financial Times, companies have increased their CSR index amount to an average of 3%, which was earlier 1%. Furthermore, this change has clearly disrupted the demand-supply chain for companies. As more and more people are concerned about the environment, they are shifting towards the usage of eco-friendly products. People are avoiding buying new automobiles, Air conditioners, Refrigerators nowadays and this is, in turn, has increased the supply more than its demand, which creates a loss for many companies. Clearly, climate change has shown a detrimental effect on many businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, this adjustment has provided ample opportunities for many start-ups. Many communities are actively contributing to the cause to heal the planet. Many new start-ups have started businesses like manufacturing paper bags, cloth bags etc. These companies, by setting up the factories in rural areas, have created numerous job employment and hence, contributing towards the economy of the nation. Therefore, for many new but small corporates, this climate change is the best bet to save the planet and increase their business turnover.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  climate transition has abrupted many businesses but has created  awareness among people to save  mankind.

        "essay": "It is argued that it is preferable for adolescents to participate in volunteer work in their spare time. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement. Since it has a clear positive impact on themselves and society. This short essay focuses on why should adults volunteer during their break time. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, young adults should be involved in social activities without getting paid in their spare time, since it enhances their self-confidence. To elaborate more, teenagers will be exposed to various new things. Therefore, a piece of new knowledge will be gained. Accordingly, they will develop their self-confidence in doing similar activities, in addition, adolescents will have the motive to try different works without having the fear of making mistakes. Considering myself, I used to have a fear of speaking publicly. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I overcome this dilemma by being involved in cleaning my village. Luckily for me, I was chosen to be the leader of a group of ten people. Therefore, I was forced to chat with them. Consequently, I found it not a big deal to be afraid of. Therefore, now I can speak in front of others. \r\n\r\nThe second reason is that it enables teenagers to be engaged with others. To illustrate more, by being exposed to different works adults will meet one another. Therefore, it creates a strong relationship with them, in addition, to with the whole society. To put it another way, today’s adults are isolated from one another. Considering the area where I live, most of them do not know the names of the individuals who live next to their doors. Furthermore, everyone lives alone. However, it has a negative effect on every individual. Since if help is needed no one would help one another due to the lack of relation. Nonetheless, by being in social activities everyone will help each other. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is claimed that adolescents should be exposed to social activities as it has many benefits for them, as well as, for the whole society.",

Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other.

First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.\r\nOther reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their huslabels. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.\r\nIn conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations.

This might be because they want to indulge the junior to the real world and makes them familiar about the world reality. For instance, the children when finishing  school education and involved in the effort they will meet with a diverse range of public living around them. Moreover, they have to mitigate their problem by themselves Which assist them to  build up  personal skills like socialisation, confident, problem-solving art and so on. That way the population might think learner after completing their learning at school so go for the job rather than going educational institution for further course.\r\n\r\nHowever, some public  might be able to the opposite of this.

Thus, it helps enhance labour productivity. In addition, it can help in doing simple manual jobs such as delivering foods or goods, becoming a sanitation worker, and even doing housework. As a result, we do not waste the workforce for these kinds of work.

To elaborate it, if schools do not give better amenities like smart classrooms and other equipments to students they may not pay attention in their study. An example to illustrate this point Is that an article about education in News of India in 2014 stated that some schools did not have sufficient amenities as well as other resources, because of this 70 percentage of children had difficulties in paying attention.

As far as I am concerned, the advantages of watching TV undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why some people claim it is detrimental for children to watch television every day. First, it is widely acknowledged that too much screen time does harm to children’s eyesight. Scientific studies suggest that children should not be glued to television. Additionally, children's psychological health might be impaired due to exposure to unsuitable contents. For example, violence and drug abuse are often shown in some films Children who lack discipline or close supervision easily become addicted to the virtual world and might adopt an impractical outlook upon life, which has an adverse influence on their well-being.\r\n\r\nHowever, watching television in fact can be informative and educational for children. To begin with, watching news is an efficient way to know what is happening around the world Saying no to television is a veto on getting informed. Also, TV shows like National Geographic and Animal World satisfy their curiosity and develop their creativity. Therefore, what matters most is being selective about what to watch and how. Last but not least, it can be quality time for both parents and children instead of a waste of time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there might be some health risks for younger generation to watch television for too long and too often I still believe that it is a blessing rather than a curse cartoons, films and a large number of programmes do enrich their life in many ways.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.\r\nThe less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.\r\nOn the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.\r\nIn conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.",

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay": "Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.\r\nChanging it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.\r\nOther people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.\r\nIn conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.",

        "essay": "Currently, the money spent has always been the topic of interest. While some claim that money invested in developing technology to discover space is not justified, the opposite makes a statement that there are more tremendous benefits to spending this money. I consider myself an advocate of this statement that the government should invest this money in other aspects.\r\n\r\nThere are a wealth of reasons why it is not necessary to spend money to explore space. Not all countries can afford to fund this aspect. Because the money spent on this program is prohibitively exorbitant and can not be used for other purposes. Moreover, this also pollutes the environment when the emissions in experiments are released into the air. As a result, this money should be used to find methods to restore the environment to save our planet.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a myriad of ways to fund this money more rationally such as investing in education. It is undeniable that education is the backbone industry of the nation. A lot of students do not have enough financial abilities to get access to school. So this money can change their student life so that they can have the opportunity to broaden their horizons.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although there are some redeeming features in space exploration, the environmental problem and poverty to go to school are more necessary.",

        "essay": "Rapid advancement in the field of technology has revolutionized many sectors, even in the field of education, changes are required to make the students equally competitive, with other students. There should be a new approach with regard to traditional methods of learning and teaching. The situation is dynamic for everyone, especially for the learners and the teachers when it comes to mainstream teaching in the schools. Therefore, I agree that teaching and learning will not be the same by the year 2050.\r\n\r\nFirstly, traditional methods of teaching have to be changed with an emphasis on moral and life skill teaching, for example, many schools in Finland have introduced in their school curriculum the life skills such as carpentry, cooking, sewing and designed the curriculum as per the needs of the students and imparting learning keeping in mind about future changes in the teaching. Furthermore, the schools are more focused on the emotional quotient and moral values such as empathy, sensitivity towards someone, and how to communicate with the parents about their feelings, how to help parents in the household chores. This way, the school is preparing the students for now and for the future by taking a holistic approach.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the schools have to change their instruction when it comes to imparting knowledge or introducing any new concepts, for example, the school in Switzerland focused on a practical approach rather than a theoretical knowledge meaning school's curriculum allows the students to explore the subjects by connecting with nature when they are learning science or geography. The schools are preparing the students for the future and adopting different ways of teaching. The schools are trying to cater to all the needs of the students and not being limited to only subjects.\r\n\r\nAt present, all the schools need to focus on conceptual understanding and developing critical thinking in the students rather than mugging up the concepts. The educational institutions have to match up with online teaching and start developing new ways to sync with future changes.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my view, the typical teaching situation of a teacher and students will not exist by 2050 and that's why all the educational institutions have to combine traditional methods with upcoming new teaching methods by instilling moral values, life skills, and knowledge instruction to prepare future generations.",

        "essay": "It's argued that Art should be mandadory for children at educational institutes. Against this ideia, There are some who claim that it would be waste of time. This essays is going to disscuss both ideias and choose which one is more resonable.\r\nArt is a extremaly difficult field to thrive in. The job oportunities are scarce and the wages are lower. For this reason many people think that investing in art as a suject at schools is a waste of time for children who are learning to be able to work and support themselves in the future. For instance, a famous actress in my country said in an interview that she had to study acting without her parents knowing this. They were against her choosing this career because she could not make a living from it.\r\nChildren are significantly more creative than adults. Studies point that when we were born, our right brain side, which comands artistic and creative skills, is more developed than the left side. Children start to lose their creative strengths as soon as they start to learn exact subject such as Mathematics and Quemistry, which are procesed by the left brain side. If they stop using their right brain side at that early stage, this can lead to a poor innovative thinking in the future. For example, in a recent survey at Melboune university 95% of the IT students, acostumed to deal most of the time with numbers, declared that they are not creative at all.\r\nAnalysing both sides, it is clear that art is not the easiest filed to have professional success. However,  this essay agrees with the view that children should not be deprived of learning art at school because it would help them to keep their creative skills. Eventhough they do not work with art in the future, Creativity is an asset for thinking outside of the box and having flexiblity to either deal with the diverse types of obstacles in their ellected profession or to innovate.\r\n",

        "prompt": "Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
        "essay": "Some people believe that luxury and prosperity are the dominant factors that bring people a meteoric rise to fame nowadays rather than their own talents and success, which leads to the negative effects on youngsters. I totally agree with this viewpoint. \r\n\r\nFor a variety of reasons, wealthy people would not necessarily be the talented or outstanding people. Firstly, they may be born in a rich family and they tend to be dependent on the financial support of their parents. For instance, in Viet Nam there have been some successful businessmen who may pass their billion dollar businesses to their sons or daughters when their children are still young. Which may lead to the luxury ways of living that their sons or daughters have even their children may not be talented. Thereby, their sons or daughters tend to be famous with richness brought from them. Secondly, people may use beauty or commit crimes to have a luxurious life. For example, the models or beautiful girls may have sensitive and close relationships with millionaires to have financial support from them. Drug dealers who have not been arrested may have a huge sum of money from illegal activities to have wealth. They may become famous with super cars or super villas without any achievements.\r\n\r\nThe mentioned prosperity and fame seem to have bad effects on young people.  For one thing, they may consider being rich at all costs will make them to be celebrities. For example, young girls tend to take care of their appearance, have rich boyfriends, prostitute rather than studying or learning at school which may lead to the deterioration of morale.  For the other thing, people tend to behave and learn from their celebrities, and when they celebrities behave badly because of the insufficient education and lack of acknowledgment, this may result in social evils in society of youngsters.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there have been a great number of ways to become rich and famous, young people should take the talent as well as the ability of celebrities as the first priority to have the right idols.",

        "essay": "Nowadays, a number of people believe schools should provide education to kids on the importance of recycling waste materials.However, others think they can get this knowledge at home.In my opinion, children have a better relationship with their parents, therefore, they should be educated about salvaging waste materials at home.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, Children spend more time in school than they spend at home. Therefore, the education sectors play an important role in a child's life. That is to say, it is mandatory for a school to provide all the necessary knowledge to children, which in turn helps to build character.It's a known fact that the younger generation tends to learn faster . Therefore, it is the duty of the teachers to educate beginners on the importance of recycling junk without the need for disposal.This is because parents send their kids to school for the main purpose of positive improvements in all aspects of their lives.Take ,for example, my nephew Riley, he reuses an old shopping bag whenever he visits the mall because he knows the importance of recycling.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, A number of children take their parents as role models. As a ,result it is possible for them to follow the examples their role models portray. Therefore, parents should enlighten their kids more on waste recycling, this is because it is more of  a lesson of character, so this can easily be taught to children by their loved ones.Recent studies have proven that the younger generation looks up to their parents when growing up. For example, when I was young, my dad had a collection of cans and sells them back to recycling companies, this is a habit for me currently.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's the sole responsibility of parents to discipline their children because they tend to be much closer. This is because it will teach them a lot including the importance of keeping some waste materials while converting them into something important for their use.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the training of the child begins at home and there is nothing like excess knowledge. In my opinion, parents should educate their children about waste recycling at home before they are sent to school, this can be done by showing a good example always.",

There are many historical places that had been debris in this present, which does make archaeologists interest to find artefacts and backstories of the place. In addition, Archaeologists can analyze and combine crucial information to give other people know more about the place such as the previous owners of the place or what is this building looks like in the past.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, citizens can find the data to discover about the building by asked seniors who live in the house or the elderly who live in the same neighbourhoods.

        "prompt": "The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Sports are considered to be one of the most effective activities in children's lifestyle as they offer immense benefits to their health and also help in overall personality development. However, it is often discussed if sports are the best technique to introduce a child to a world where being cooperative is an essential part of regular survival in this competitive world. In my opinion, I fully agree that a school can be the best institution where children can be taught collaboration and teamwork by playing sports activities. \r\n\r\nChildhood is the most appropriate time when an individual learns life lessons. So, any skill learnt at the school level prepares a student to perform well in real-life situations in future. Talking about a sport like a football, it requires team efforts in order to goal of the counter-party due to which the whole team wins the game at the end. Also, the winning team is given a big trophy and some cash prize. This kind of game makes a child build team spirit as they all work towards the same goal and at the winning stage, they share the prizes between themselves. Such situations make a child more empathetic towards others and develop him to fight big challenges of life with good confidence. \r\n\r\nAnother reason why playing sports in school is the best platform for young children to learn collaborative skills is that they often do not encounter situations at their house. Therefore, schools provide a space where kids meet multiple other children with different personalities and end up being friends as they exchange their thoughts and learn about each other's interests. This helps them to grow as a person. On the other hand, when these children compete with each other in the game, they show a team spirit yet play mutually and support one another which makes them realise how combined efforts in any situation can be beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can be said that school sports play an important role in moulding child's nature and teach them critical skills which cannot be taught apart from them. A child learns the value of combined efforts and develops their sharing mindset which is quite less possible to be taught in the home-place other than in schools. Therefore, sports activities offered at educational places must be encouraged by the parents and school staff itself, considering the positive impact it does on the children.",

        "essay": "Many consumers consider cost as their top priority when making a purchase decision. Spending carefully is essential however, in my opinion, expenditure should not be your top priority when making purchases.\r\n\r\nWe should first determine whether a good or service is essential to our daily lives before shelling out any cash on it. We need to make sure the product or service is affordable if it is essential. Because there are instances when a less expensive option will do just as well. When we need to buy a phone, for instance, it does not matter if it is an iPhone or a Samsung; we can save money by opting for the former. People are willing to pay more for a well-known brand. The value of goods and services should be reflected in their prices. We should not go into debt to buy name-brand anything that is not really necessary right now.\r\n\r\nSometimes, we have no choice but to put our health and well-being ahead of our financial concerns.

From my point of ,view, I believe that television is the most dangerous instrument for changing child behaviour. \r\n\r\nFirstly ,in my ,opinion, watching TV  is not suitable for children. For example ,in most countries around the world ,all offsprings have a noticeable desire to watch diverse programmes on television such as action movies ,TV shows and animations. Because of having a strong imagination among the young ,generation, they commence to imitate from these and play the roles. There is no denying that this could cause changes in scions treatment. Therefore ,this makes it clear the reasons  those who do not accept TV is appropriate.\r\n\r\nBy contrast ,others believe that scion should watch television but not for a long time. For instance ,most parents legislate this rule at their home that their offspring could watch programmes on television for about 2 hours per day. These people claim by conducting this we can monitor our child's behaviour also the negative impact of watching TV start to reduce to observe this rule by scions. This would create a space for doing assignments also playing with siblings by their toys. In addition to conducting this activity by parents the quantity of reading books to be increased. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are many vital reasons behind each claim toward the community.\r\n\r\nTo summarise , I personally believe television is the most hazardous stuff for all humans on the Earth ,particularly, for offspring.

        "essay": "Undoubtedly, crimes are dramatically increasing in many urban areas around the world, especially among children. It is caused by many factors such as environment or drug abuse which are solved in different ways. In this essay, I will discuss  the cause of the problem and guide the ways to figure out this situation shown in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the most important cause of crimes in kids, is their environment, including  family. This is obviously to say that family is the basis of their lives. If the family keep an eye on them and try to help them with their problems, they will know how to get rid of them. In contrast, if their family ignore them, children will try to solve the problem by themselves and it can be the worst way or illegal way. Moreover, teenagers are the age that wants to try new and interesting things so they tend to try some drugs or illegal substances such as amphetamine or marijuana. it can lead to unconsciousness and unintentional. From that symptoms can make them do something wrong, for example, crime or hurt themselves without guilty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problems listed above can be solved. Firstly, the government should take an action like making a policy to increase the punishment if children do something wrong or use drugs which are illegal. Secondly, the family should keep an eye on them because the family is the one who could notice their behaviours when they are sad or change their actions, the family should take an action with them without violence. And finally, the school should teach them more about crime and how to protect themselves from dangerous situations with open-mindedness. For examples. schools should teach and give  information about violence in their cities to make them think about how dangerous it is. and try to solve that problem in small groups with their friends. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the environment is the most important which  definitely impacts young people's thoughts and consciousness so if everyone in the city manages their environment well there will have less crime. Furthermore, it is not helpful if we try to control everything but the children still do the same behaviour so the significant change starts with them.",

Some people claimed that high-tech machines will finally take over human’s jobs whereas some people are argued that there will be a lot of jobs human do which AI are not capable to complete. Personally, I disagree with the statement becaus Artificial Robotics are not fully developed enough to cover all the jobs, like Artworks, Specialist occupations, and Musicians.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that the AI play an important role in people jobs in many countries. Some people are passionate about technology and are easily trapped by the convenience of high-tech. Moreover, they found it helps their business to save time and money than employ human . For example, producing newspapers and magazines. In the past decade , those tasks were completed by labour which means the companies have to employed a humen and pay salary monthly In order to run their business smoothly. Another work is doing house chores, particularly in urban society, almost everyone is not only occupied by their workload each day, but also their precious time with the children and family. Therefore, some people are grateful  and pleased for advancement of house chore machines which are valuable for the money as it has helped in terms of saving time and doing tedious house chore works.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are several works that are usually being done by human.

For example, my mom's friend's Facebook account was  hacked by a bad guy, and this guy used her account to borrow money from friends on the list. Eventually, more than 10 friends were convinced to transfer a large amount of money accounting for 1 million baht to the suspect account. Furthermore, online platforms can attribute people to addiction.

As the result, eyes problem and accidents on road can happen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are enormous benefits that can be found on social media. First of all, it can keep people in touch.

Hence, the ongoing generation must present themselves for the sake of society.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the secondary view of this statement is the positive effect on an individual's life.

        "prompt": "Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Issues related to volunteer work to be done by the youth for the neighborhood are being discussed these days. Growing concerns are becoming heated questions among the community that leisure part of the day for today’s generations should be spent by doing charity work for the society. While this view is rubbished by some critics who oppose it. The dissertation accedes with the given statement. Both the views have their logic to support their opinion which will be discussed in this dissertation before coming to any conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs far as the matter is concerned, I would like to stamp the mark on this view by stating that helping society in free hours by the teenagers has a remarkable impact on the people. The first and foremost point that strikes my mind is that the younger generation learns how to become responsible citizens by adding their efforts into the community. Another noteworthy notion that caters attention is that they become more social which help them in developing mental and social wellbeing. This can be explained precisely by citing an example of a survey which showed a comparison between students who spent their extra o'clock volunteering in social work with children who engage themselves in activities like playing video games and gossiping. The results concluded that teenagers who spent their time doing something for the locality had a better social and helping attitude whereas the others had a conservative attitude.\r\n\r\nAs every matter has two aspects, another matter of this aspect deals with its opposite side. Some population are in the favor of not supporting their children to do anything during their free for the association because they believe it’s a waste of moments and ,instead this point can be utilized in learning something new as an extracurricular activity.\r\n\r\nAfter cogitating on a great deal of thought and discussion the conclusion to be drawn here is that everything has its own significant value especially regarding the folk’s viewpoint of teenagers working for free towards the betterment of the society. All we  require is to have an optimistic approach and a ppositive attitude so that we can help in building a better world for the future generation.",

        "essay": "In many communities, it is accepted that young people do free work for the community. I agree that this is correct, and in this essay I will try to explain it. \r\n\r\nAs we know, humanity has lived in communities for many years. Traditional values are passed down from generation to generation. And one of the most important qualities is the ability to work, because this is what provides people with the necessary things for their existence. The older generation of people usually teach the younger ones, because the younger ones do not yet have enough experience to do the job well. For example, many schools offer work education classes where teenagers can do useful things for the community like birdhouses for birds or prepare simple meals for charity dinners. At the same time, teenagers feel needed for society, which increases their self-esteem. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they gain useful experience and knowledge. For example, the ability to cook is always useful in the future. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would like to say that unpaid work for the community among teenagers brings them together and distracts them from things like drugs and other addictions.",

        "prompt": "Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
        "essay": "It is a fact that some celebrities become more popular for their luxurious lifestyles and possessions these days rather than for their mesmerising accomplishments. To a certain extent, this kind of popularity tends to lead young people in the wrong direction. However, there are also some celebrities who got to the place that they are at the moment for their actions and accomplishments.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some celebrities pursued easy ways to get famous such as getting married to a popular or rich person, living a fancy, shopaholic lifestyle or even doing unbelievable things and streaming live sessions. Moreover, it has become easier as social media platforms such as TikTok and instagram turned into a spotlight especially for those kinds of people. For  instance, the Kardasian family members are now billionaires with all the money gained from their reality show and hot topics of Hollywood despite the fact that not even one of them has a talent such as acting, singing or doing sports. Additionally, a group of TikTokers named Hype House is such a hit and on the tip of the tongue of every teenager these days but what they are doing are inappropriate performances, dances, partying and even breaking rules and restrictions during the pandemic. Such kinds of influences only aim to gain publicity and send a wrong message to the youngsters that successful life means wealth and accessories and it does not have to be meaningful.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it is great to have such kinds of famous people who live with compassion and put their great efforts to gain success in life. From their perspective, a way to success is a combination of passion, hard work and strong determination. Those are the people who apply themselves in developing their skills and abilities through perseverance. As an example, a korean boy label named BTS is nowadays among the most famous celebrities in this 21st century. They came all the way from South Korea and broke amazing records one by one in a way that no South Koreans have ever done before. All the members came from rural areas of their country to Seoul and worked so hard even before their debut. As a result, now they’ve become a tourism ambassador of their country and worked with the United Nations to help improve the mental health of youths under the program called “Love yourself”. Due to their hard work, now, they’ve set a great example and become idols to young people all over the world and made those youngsters believe in themselves and their worth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is true that as various types of social media platforms are being accessible these days, children are likely to be influenced by the so-called celebrities. Anyway, there are still some famous people who can make young people believe that their dreams could come true with hard work and passion. Thus, in my opinion, I think it is best if young people become more selective with choosing their role models.",

Parents, accordingly, can opt for any of these academies for their offsprings to study. While some individuals advocate children who have schooling from single-sex schools face difficulties in later life, I disagree with this notion as students who study in single-sex schools have the same education as co-educational institutions provide to their scholars ,and they have interaction with other sexes after school hours, so it does not have any effect on their later life. \r\n\r\nIn terms of education, both single-sex and co-educational academies provide a similar level of education to their students, which means opting for single-sex institutions does not have any effect on students' studies. In other words, the same school subjects are taught in both institutions, so whether to study in a single-sex or co-educational institute does not make any difference in academic studies. Single-sex school students, for example, study the same subjects, such as science, English and maths. Students, therefore, who study in single-sex have the same level of opportunities as co-educational scholars have.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is that interacting with other genders after school times creates no difference between a co-educational and single-sex student. This means that single-sex school students still have interaction with other genders after getting free from  school.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, obtaining education from a co-educational or single-sex school does not make in difference in a individual's life.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are reasons for this? How can people research this?",
        "essay": "In the past, the history facts of any particular house were only being interested by architects and estate agents. However, in the modern time, more and more people are passionate about researching their residence’s background to satisfy their curiosity or for their religious purposes. This essay will discuss some main causes for this trend and suggest a few possible methods for finding the history of any house.\r\n\r\nCuriosity is probably the first reason that urging people to investigate the background of their building. That is due to the fact that many people start sharing their own stories lying under their house on social media, thus encourage more people, especially youngsters, to find interesting facts of their place so that have more decent conversation with their friends. Another factor that can be accounted for is the owners' superstitious matters. Specially for Asian countries - where the local are well-known for their religion culture, the past events of their house become far more important since they show whether that building is suitable for the owners or not. For instance, Vietnamese have a traditional rule stating that they should not live on, or near, a former graveyard because that is disrespectful to the deaths and they will be punished for that. Therefore, it is necessary for people to know the past details of their property.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty methods that can be applied for finding a house's background. Firstly, despite the fact that many real estate agents may sometimes distorted the truth in order to have an easier negotiation with buyers, they are still a very reliable source for ones who want to know better about their house. These agents always have specific details about their in-charged building, thus if any people can get access to it, they will be fully equipped with necessary information. Secondly, social media can also be used to research about one location. However, this method might not as effective compared to the previous one because it is extremely difficult to find any information of a specific area.\r\n\r\nIn essence, it is irrefutable that the interest on the history of their house will still increase in the future. Particularly, most of people want to know better about the history of their house because of their curiosity and their superstitious and through online articles and people's knowledge, they can gather the basic background of their residence.",

In my opinion, it is a positive  development because couple solidify their relationship before the arrival of their kids also they Will cease the opportunity to improve their income. Rasing children late might be stressful because they are out of job.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, some people believe that arrival of youngsters might distance them from their lover, so they build bond before children started coming. In addition, some couple claimed that wealth should be first thing in relationship in other to build financial security for their kids. For instance, my niece did not start having babies until after 5 years of marriage, in which they claimed working hard to earn  more money before arrival of their offspring, and this made them stable financially. Moreso, some people believe maturity is essential before having children and maturity comes with age.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as having offsprings as an individual get older has upper hand, it also has downside. Having children at older age may cause medical complications to the mother and the baby. In 2021, A survey  carried out by midwives in Lagos State Nigeria, reveal that , some maternal complications is  as a result of having babies from thirty five years and above.

In my opinion, robots have advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some jobs will be replaced by AI robots because they rarely make mistakes. They not only reduce the rate of mistakes and accidents, but also ensure people's safety. For example, there is a lawyer in Shanxi, China. After being bribed by the defendant, he fabricated important evidence. Through this event, I found that artificial intelligence is fairer than human beings, and the police, doctors or lawyers etc, are likely to be displaced in the future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some occupations cannot complete by man-made robots. Furthermore, the thinking of human-made robots is mechanized, and the matters they do lack sensibility. It is hard to have a human’s rich sensibility, as a result, it is difficult to move people. For instance, a singer can touch a person, but a computer cannot make us cry. Thus, it is impossible that all things will be done by AI.\r\n\r\nAccording to the two viewpoints mentioned above, the robot is a double-edged sword. The benefit is that AI robots are easy to use and they are also safer for us. In addition, they will really lead us to become lazy. If this situation gets worse, they will guide people to resist robots, which is likely to cause war. Therefore, we must make rational use of artificial intelligence robots in our jobs.",

However I am with museum as educational purposes and this essay will examine the reason.\r\n\r\nTo begin with,museums from the enjoyable perspectives, individuals prefer visiting museums to enjoy their time and observe the differences between past and present . In  other words, individuals  travel abroad to visit museums in their vacation because they found relaxation and they feel inspired .For instance, the survey done in 2023 at Sultan Qaboos University showed  the number of visitors who visit Oman museums yearly more than 100 thousands  .Therefore, it seems logical that museums are one of the entertainment places.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, museums from educational perspective, it is the best way to learn specially for students because explaining subjects likewise history with visible materials it helps to understand the subject better and it gives students cleare idea but, if they study without trip to museum the information in the book is just abstract words .

        "essay": "It is true that genealogy has become increasingly in terms of popularity in many countries. This trend can be attributed to several key reasons and I believe that it can be both benefical and detrimental for those who wish to study their family history.\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors contributing to the commonality of this tendency is the potential reinforcement for better health choices. By delving deeping into their ancestor's history, people can uncover the information about genetically inherited health problems, allowing them to be more aware of their own risks. Armed with this knowledge, they can make informed decisions and adopt specific lifestyle changes to mitigate these problems. Additionally, researching family history can lead to the discovery of long-lost relatives caused by geographical barriers or consequences of wars. To illustrate, DNA databases, such as Bionet, have facilitated the reunion of millions of Vietnamese refugees as users can compare genetic information and trace their family tree online.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are both benefits and drawbacks to this approach. On the positive side, this study allows individuals to develop a family medical history, from which they might take action to mitigate the effects of hereditary diseases. If they did not find out their ancestor history, the would not know which diseases would arise and in some worst-case scenarios, it is too late for any treatment. In contrast, it is an incredibly time-consuming endeavour. Researchers are required to collect and analyze intentsive data on their family relationships and records which can be quite challenging in the modern life where people are object subjected by a hectic schedule. For instance, a friend of mine, who lost her father in 1975 spent about a decade searching for their siblings living in the U.S. This exemplifies the amount of time required in such a study.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the trend to research family history has emerged due to a desire for better health choices and enhanced connections with relatives. While this approach allows people to develop a family medical history which is useful for disease treatment, it costs a huge amount of time. Thus, it is advisable that individuals should weigh these factors and decide if engaging in this pursuit aligns with their priorities and overall well-being.",

Both views will be discussed in this essay, though I personally feel that the directors of these companies should be paid higher salaries.\r\n\r\nMany people think it is unjustifiable to pay managers a wage that is 10 times more than an employee earning the lowest salary in the company. The reason behind this thought is the member's mindset. They believe that the salary paid should be based on the employee's contribution to the growth of the company and not the position of the worker. They argue that a regular employee works much harder and even does extra hours and hence contributes more than the higher authorities towards the success of the organization. This discretion in salary creates low work loyalty and poor motivation among the staff.\r\n\r\nHowever, these people do not understand that salary is not directly proportional to the amount of work done. The remuneration of the higher authorities is based on competition. The board members set a standard salary for executives on the basis of the carcity of competent managers. Moreover, the manager has a lot of responsibilities. Even though he is a manager, he still has to manage his team, manage different projects, make and submit reports to the higher-ups, etc. Therefore, is it justifiable to pay high compensation to the directors of such organizations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, every employee in a company feels that everyone should be equally paid.

This essay will point out some reasons caused this widespread trend and also suggest some constructive ways to gain more data about this topic. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason for this tendency might be the interest to the historical topics. Some residences specially who live in the old and historical buildings would like to know more about the past time of their place because listening to and reading a part of historical tale could always be attractive and pleasant for some of this planet inhabitants and these legends could be more interesting and attractive when the owner of that place will give performance in the future of this storyline.

I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with,  social work by children can be easily associated with personality development because during this drive, they tend to communicate with variety of people, leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance,patience,team spirit,cooperation can be learnt.

        "essay": "In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.\r\nDue to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.\r\nOn the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.\r\nIn my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.\r\nIn conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees.",

We are living in a globalization era with technological advancements  becoming one of the basic demands.

Many citizens would be grateful if there were any outdoor fields for them to hang out together instead of chatting through social media. The squares will prevent the communities from breaking down by social media platforms that act as a public space for people who use the internet. \r\n\r\nFrom what I have experienced, I surely suggest every state  settle these public areas such as gardens which are great long-term benefits for the communities.

Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.\r\nTo begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.\r\nSome augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.\r\nHaving considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business.

        "essay": "Climate change has always been a debatable issue of countries leaders and a worldwide concern. Some people believe that global warming is unavoidable so that they must learn to live with it, instead of fighting against it. I completely disagree with this statement because the issue would bring about negative effects on the lives of humans and other species.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of global warming is crucial to the masses’ quality of lives because the phenomenon is diametrically harmful to the overall atmosphere. Air pollution would have a negative impact on the job performance and wellbeing of individuals, especially outdoor workers. Constructors or builders have to work under the scorching sun most of the days, therefore extremely hot or cold weather and polluted air considerably lower the task efficiency and the physical health of these workers. Moreover, there are situations where people pass out due to the extreme heat. Therefore, temperature change brings lots of consequences to the human body and life standards.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we should aim to prevent global warming instead of ignoring it is to preserve biodiversity for endangered animals. As the climate is getting warmer, the icebergs from the North Poles would melt considerably and faster. This would push the life of polar bears and other species to the brink of extinction because their habitats are getting subsequentially smaller. As a matter of fact, the number of these cold-blooded animals would majorly decrease or they could die out from hunger. The near-extinction of these animals proves why we have to prevent this drastic issue as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, living with global warming is never a sensible option due to the detrimental effects it causes to human and animal lives.

Some homes can be hundreds of years old so the background can be quite relevant to some people. I will be discussing the reasons and how people can research their own home.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons would be to try and establish the true value of the property. Especially from an investment point of view. This is because knowing the value of a home can help potential buyers negotiate with the seller to get a better deal on their new home. For example, if a house was sold for a hundred thousand five years ago, they buyer now has a better idea of the true value. Additionally, it gives them some peace of mind as some homes can be quite expensive. Moreover, it gives them an idea of when they would need to renovate the property, as this is usually a requirement after a certain period of time for most houses and buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways in which a person may be able to find out about the history of a particular building or house. The easiest would be to use the internet and find out as much as they can online. Not to mention, they would also be able to find out about the entire area or region, not only one specific building. Another way would be to ask the real estate agent what they know about the property as they tend to have the most knowledge about the properties they deal with. Lastly, contact their local library and try to find some historic books about the area.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, fraud is becoming a lot more common than people think.

Let's see some points that butt rests the fact.\r\n\r\nGradual growth by country, not only the living expense has been increased, but also people are more inclined to their career. Indeed, as a child needs complete support both financially and socially. For example, let's consider two families have their child at different stages of their life, one at earlier and another at a later stage. First family didn't get the sufficient time for planning nor time for gathering capital, adding to their own expense they had to take care of their children. Moreover, they weren't able to focus on their careers and had to devote their fraction of time to their child. The growth became stagnant and had to live a mediocre life. Unlike the other family, with adequate time and planning, they were able to focus their early stage of life to their career growth in addition to that became financially strong. \r\n\r\nComparing both families, having a child or children, it completely depends on their own, but being a responsible citizen, with growing population and lack of our centre of attraction to our career, not only put us in jeopardy but also our children.

I, disagree   with the given statement that it can benefit only the employees and not the employers.   Telecommuting is a win-win situation for both employers and employees.  There are many advantages of telecommuting to employees. To begin with, it saves time as   no time is wasted commuting to and from the office. It also saves money as no spending on   private or public transport has to be done. Furthermore the worker can look after family   commitments like dropping the child to school etc. Although most of the work done by tele￾workers is monitored, still a few minutes can be snatched at times. Finally, the tele-worker   can do some side business side by side.  On the other hand there are many advantages to employers. Firstly, less office space is   needed as the workers are working from home. It is a fact that land prices are exorbitant   and it is very expensive to build large offices. Not only building but maintaining offices is   also very costly. Then, it has been seen that employees take less sick leave and other leaves.   This is also beneficial for employers.   It would be worthwhile to consider why some people opine that telecommuting is not   beneficial for employers. They argue that supervising tele-workers is difficult. Statistics have   proved that telecommuters take pains to work well from home as they realise the benefits it   has for them.

        "essay": "In some cases, children thrive in school so there is no reason to consider any alternatives. In other cases, children have such a bad time at school or for whatever reasons, home education becomes a necessity. In fact, there is an upward trend for parents who want to let their children study at home instead of regular school education. This essay looks at some of the pros and cons of the home education, but from my perspective its drawbacks outweigh the benefits may it bring.\r\nOne of the amazing benefits that have to be told is the individual attention and instruction between the parents and their children. May they have more than one child but the attention they give is definitely far more than a teacher with a class of twenty or thirty. With this advantage, the children can easily have a good grasp on the lessons. In addition, if they do not understand anything they can totally ask their parents at any time during day or night. Another benefit is the flexibility on holidays due to the fact that they do not have to follow the schedule all the times and can immediately take a day off whenever they want.\r\nOn the other hand, home education still has many disadvantages. Firstly, when children stay home schooled, they cannot make friends or have many chances to interact with those at the same age. As a result, home educated children tend to be less sociable and have more difficulties when trying to fit in any communities. Secondly, home education requires a parent to work full-time as an instructor, a teacher and a friend to their children and also, they must have experience in teaching and educating; therefore, this is not for every family. Finally, it may be complex for further application to universities or colleges.\r\nOverall, it is important to consider the particular situation and the needs of the children to determine the most appropriate method for their education.",

Such celebrities always manage to make it to the headlines by creating sensational acts either in  films or in real life. Therefore, these kinds of celebrities have a negative influence on young people because instead of influencing people with their achievements and accomplishments, they try to manipulate youngsters with their wealth and luxurious lifestyle.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are some famous superstars in the entertainment industry whose acting skills might be average. Still, they always manage to stay in the headlines by showing off their wealth, and glamorous lifestyles. Their behaviour and attitude always have an adverse influence on teenagers. For example, Kylie Jenner, who is famous for her reality show, usually shows off her palatial mansion, high-profile parties, and opulent lifestyle instead of merely acting. Thus, it is possible that the young people will easily get influenced by her behaviour and her rich lifestyle, which would have a negative effect on them.\r\n\r\nThough there are a few actors in the entertainment industry who portray positive acts on-screen and are extremely talented, there are a lot many others who spoil young minds.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, we can reiterate that all TV personalities have positive and negative impacts on people.

I totally agree with that opinion as there are a lot of young teen who consume their time for unhealthy activities. This essay will discuss why teenagers must join with community tasks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, teenagers have good health and sharp minds to help their communities. To make it clear, this means the age of 15 to 22 years old is regarded as puberty with well-being and creativity. They can learn fast and use their power to assist others. For example, a young teen might spend their hours after school to go to a nursing home or hospital and support the staff to run errands. Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, these growing teen are developing their life skills, thus, it is crucial to volunteer and correct their demerits.

I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. \r\n\r\nSecond, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it. Instead, everybody must comply with the rules and regulations set forth under respected institutions and non-governmental organizations for avoiding the consequences of it. By taking individual steps and pressuring governments, we can get positive results and leave a clean and viable earth for the next generations.",

        "essay": "Overweight might be a serious issue nowadays. However, I disagree with those who have opinion that the solution of this case is to increase price of foods which consist of high fat, compared with those with have other alternatives. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the increasing price of fattening foods might be a solution so that people would not tend to buy the expensive fattening food. They might think that to eat fattening foods needed maximal effort in the context of gaining money. The pricey fattening foods could also make the society become to prefer eat non high-fat foods so that they consume other nutrient components along with avoided by fatty foods. It could appeared an awareness about fattening foods.   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, not all overweight people are poor, that is why this is not an effective method. Moreover, fat foods are also needed for some people who have underweight and not all of them are rich, it will cause the new problem, which called social-economic gap. In addition, either the obesity or overweight people could diet if they have the motivation for being ideal itself. For instance, an overweight person still try to make a lot of money to have the pricey fattening food as they want unless they have an intention for reducing their weight. Other methods that should be applied are the campaign of healthy lifestyle, such as exercise regularly, food diet, and so on.   \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, rising the price of fatty foods might make people think twice to buy fattening foods, however it is not an effective approach for making people become aware of overweight or obesity problem.",

        "prompt": "Nowadays, More And More People Decide To Have Children Later In Their Life. What Are The Reasons? Do Advantages Of This Outweigh Disadvantages?",
        "essay": "In contemporary society, adults are inclined to delay having children until they reach their middle age. In this essay, I would like to demonstrate several reasons for this tendency and discuss that its drawbacks outweigh its benefits.\r\nTo begin with, there are some explanations for people’s avoidance of becoming parents too soon in their life. A prominent justification is that they want to be better-prepared for the family life financially. Individuals at their early stage of career may find it daunting difficult to afford a youth’s basic demands, so it is reasonable for them to wait until they have accumulated a sufficient amount of money to guarantee a fulfilled material life for their children. Another reason would be that the adults may want to enjoy their life before having a new family member. In illustration, it is easier for married couples to travel without a child to nurture.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this proclivity of procrastination is advantageous to some extent. To be more specific, families living on a stable income is capable of providing their offspring with high quality education and nutritious diets. However, I hold the view that the disadvantages of this trend are more convincing. It has been scientifically proven that older parents are more likely to give birth to less healthy progeny. Those children may suffer from a number of serious diseases, ranging from rickets to autism. In the long run, this may have an adverse effect on the overall competence of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is understandable why people want to have children in their middle age, but they have to stay alert to the aforementioned significant threats.",

        "essay": "The topic of whether children should not do homework after school or definitely important to do homework plays a key role in the education of children. Although\r\nthere are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.\r\nInitially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.\r\nOn the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class\r\neveryday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.\r\nFinally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.\r\nhomework is necessary for children more than anything.",

        "prompt": "Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.\r\nTo what extent do you think are consumers are influenced by advertisements?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat measures can be taken to protect them?",
        "essay": "Advertising is becoming increasingly pervasive and this has led some to question its influence on the average person. In my opinion, advertisements are indeed persuasive and most consumers could be better protected if governmental regulations were stricter.\r\n\r\nPotential customers are greatly influenced, consciously and unconsciously, by advertising. The best evidence for the effectiveness of advertising does not come from scientific studies but the continued investment of powerful corporations. Corporations have become more efficient and clever in their use of advertising and this is clearly demonstrated in the growth of companies such as Facebook and Google which generate the majority of revenue from marketing. Advertisers are now able to target specific audience segments online and tailor ads to vulnerable demographics. Often these commercials and posts do not compel an immediate purchase, however, they linger subconsciously in users’ minds and contribute to overall brand awareness.\r\n\r\nSuch pervasive advertising can be countered only through laws. Individuals themselves often do not understand the threat or they lack the willpower to stay off the internet, where most advertising now occurs. Law-makers, in contrast, have the ability to enact regulations designed to ban certain kinds of advertisements and protect the general populace. For example, after United States elections in 2016, the government investigated and passed strict regulation to limit how foreign powers are able to purchase advertising space on social media to influence politics. Some of these laws should be extended more broadly to the corporate world so that, for instance, companies cannot target individuals susceptible to addictive behaviors by marketing unhealthy foods, videogames, and questionable pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the amount of investment in the advertising industry clearly shows the tremendous impact of marketing and federal governments are responsible for legislation. If steps are not taken, advertising may do irreparable harm to society in the future.",

        "essay": "In modern society, traffic jams are the most urgent issue for many cosmopolitan cities around the world. There are several causes of the high volume of vehicles on roads. However, there are certain steps that governments should take to resolve this problem. This essay will be discussed both main factors contributing to this problem and solutions to remedy.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the two main causes for this issue are the low prices of oil and poor public transportations. Firstly, people choose to drive private vehicles rather than travelling by public transportation as the oil's price is cheap. The advanced technologies of oil productions drive down the cost of producing oil and therefore, most people at all income levels are able to afford this fossil energy. Research from Imperial college London reveals that since 1980 when oil price had decreased for the first time, the high levels of oil consumptions have corresponded with the high volumn of traffic on the streets.\r\n\r\nAnother important cause is that public transportations have poor conditions and are unreliable. Workers, who need to work in the morning, would unlikely to take risks of being late according to the delay of buses or trains. Therefore, people are likely to drive their own cars so that they will be on time for working.\r\n\r\nThere are several steps that governments should take to remedy this issue. The state should consider taxing on oils in order to raise the price of energy consumption. If oils become more pricey, people will avoid to drive private cars for working or travelling. For example, after Chinese government increased taxes on oil prices, the traffic on roads were reduced by 60%. Moreover, an additional action would be improving the public facilities. Governments should provide more budgets to maintenance bus and train systems as well as increase the frequency of services provided by those transportations in order to gain more users. In Japan, for instance, the main reason that 90% of Japanese people use trains in their daily life as they trust in the high quality of public services in their country and therefore they are willing to travel more on trains.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that oil prices and poor public transportations lead to high levels of traffic on the roads having said that there also certain solutions that governments can take to resolve this issues.",

        "essay": "Implementation of automation machines has exponentially increased in various workplaces and some individuals believe this can lead to the job replacement for the humans completely. Although most of the jobs that require a set of instructions will be carried out by bots, there are some tasks that can be accomplished economically and will still require manpower. This essay will discuss why only the majority of work will be replaced by artificial intelligence computers.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, operations that require critical thinking and a set of algorithms to perform will require robots. Since  they perform on computer programs and the chances of getting the issue are minimal; the time taken to complete delivery is significantly quick.  Automobile manufacturing factories in Europe, for example, have different bots and electronic gadgets based on the effort; Like, painting, designing and manufacturing the vehicle and assembling complex parts of the main Engine. For these reasons, a critical business that requires analytical thinking will be replaced by an appliance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the organization having a low budget will still require human labour. Because installation and maintenance of artificially intelligent devices require huge capital,  this can be achieved by hiring  skilled labour at minimum cost. For instance, a daily worker who works on  keeping the community clean requires less capital compared to floor cleaning bots. Hence, some skilled work still requires human connection and cannot be replaced totally by the android appliance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the usage of electronic machines has grown in many sectors. performance that requires complicated operations would be substituted by robots; while, the skilled tasks still require humans and gadgets would not be fully replaced.

On possible issue is that many contents provide misleading and dishonest information. As a result, this leading consumers to make purchases that they later regret.

Another merit worth mentioning is that this digital media can create jobs in the marketing and advertising industries, which contribute to economy.

For many people, the content shown on television has a massive impact on children's actions. For others, they believe that the amount of time spent in front of the telly is the reason for the change in their conduct. In this essay, we shall discuss both sides of this coin.\r\n\r\n\tOn one hand, natives argue that the content they watch is directly affecting the children's behaviour. With the constant streaming of advertisements, children get coaxed into wanting things that they don't even need. Furthermore, these advertisements do not talk about the drawback of their products, so the children are not aware of the same, and instead bother their parents for them. Another reason why children feel that they must have these articles is because of peer pressure. For example, the constant bombardment of adverts in relation to McDonald's foods, makes children get addicted to the concept of this food.\r\n\r\n\tAlternately, the long durations at which they watch the box, are also a cause for concern. The continuous motion of flashing lights is a fast motion, can be irritable to the eyes and damage the eyesight of a child. Prolonged exposure to television can also result in them becoming highly dependable on the tube, thereby causing a disconnect with parents and friends.\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, I feel that both the amount of time, and the content which a child watches on the television both influence their characters, but in a negative way.",

In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.\r\nInitially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.\r\nAnother point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.\r\nFinally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.\r\nIn conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach.",

In this essay I will attempt to cover both beliefs.\r\nThere are many people who believe that museums are suitable places for entertainment. Nobody can argue with the fact that some families bring their children to the museums just for amusement. Despite the fact that large number of visitors are elders who have background knowledge about history and art, it seems that a small portion of visitors are teenagers who prefer to pass their free times in museums. In addition, some think that various complexes such as universities, institutions and colleges are appropriate for educational aims. There is no doubt that all people need to have fun. As a result, museums are good options, therefore, they should be stunning and well-designed to absorb the attentions of all visitors. \r\nOn the other hand, some people believe that the major goal of museums is teaching. It is no surprise that by visiting historical museums ordinary people as well as scientists and scholars can learn more about different matters such as art, physics and astrology. Moreover, it is clear that in many countries attendants are not common people. First introduced in the eighteenth century, many museums in western countries like Louvre and British Museum were hosting well-known historians, archeologists and travelers who interested in ancient subjects. Consequently, the atmosphere of museums have been designed based on pedagogical concepts to inform observers about different aspects of specific subject.\r\nTo sum up, there are different views about the main function of museum. Although some people believe that museums are best place for entertainment, others argue that they are useful for instructing. It is better to take into account both aspects in the process of designing museums.",

In this essay, I will elaborate on why they think that way and how they can find out the history associated with it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in some cases, when someone starts living in the house, they listen to strange sounds and feel unsafe. They observe that there might be any crime or killing-related event that could have happened. For instance, in movies, we have often seen that the house is haunted due to an unusual activity committed by previous owners. As a result, they will be well aware of any unexpected bad luck coming their way. In addition, they might want to find out if there is any repair or upgradation needed. If the building was built a long time ago with not good materials, replacement and maintenance would be important. An illustration of  this is that many authorities public a restricted law limiting the usable time of a building to about 50 years. After that, the building has to be either demolished or reconstructed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the handiest way of finding the history of the building is to reach out to a lawyer. Since lawyers have certain contacts and access to some information which ordinary people do not have, they can easily find out if there was any case related to the place. For example, in some cases, people might hide information that can cause roadblocks in selling their house, but by doing a background check via lawyers, everything will be transparent. This way, the current owner will have the knowledge needed and will be satisfied with their present home.\r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, it is common these days that folks want to know everything related to their apartment and there is no harm in doing so by reaching out to government officials and ordinary people.",

It is considered by some that governments should raise the price of fuel for transport to eliminate the environmental problems. In my opinion, I disagree that rise in cost of fuel is an effective solution. However, I believe that there are other better and long term solution such as using renewable energy and improving public transportation.\r\n\r\n     Raising the fuel price will only be a short term solution because people will continue the use of transportation as there are no other viable options to run the vehicles. In fact, people will eventually accept the high fuel price for their own convenience to travel everywhere they wish with their own car. Besides, due to increase in petrol price, the transportation costs increase causing price of goods to rise, creating a detrimental domino effect in economy and increase the people’s burden. For example, shipping fee for online shopping which is free before, now is charged due to higher transportation cost.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, I believe that a more effective long term solution is using the more sustainable energy such as solar energy, hydropower and wind energy to run both private and public transport which emission of harmful gases, for example, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide which contributes to deteriorating of air pollution. Furthermore, vehicles using renewable energy often engines produce lesser noise which can enhance the sound pollution. Government should take actions in improving public transport to engage people to use as well as older transports usually are not eco-friendly.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, increasing the price of fuel is not the best way to resolve the environmental pollutions.

While, other group of people think, it up to individuals to determine how they want to live their lives. Health, in my prespective, primarily a personal obligations also, the government has number of other oprions for encouraging citizens to healtheir life. This essay will substantiate views in the following paragraph with relevant examples. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand , a group of intellectuals assert that, administration have to make some laws for the most nutritious foods. It is not a neglectable the fact that the healthy diet is good for our body to maintain a healthy metabolic rate along with some other benefits. For example, a few decades ago one law was passed for good health that prohibits activities that has detrimental effects on life such as, drug, alcohol, and  smoking are prohibited for certain countries together with few states. In addition in few countries government levies heavy taxes on fast food in order to discourage people from eating it. Hence, these strategies can have positive effects on an individuals health. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many people believe they should be responsible for their food and drink decisions, because personal freedom is their fundamental right. For instance, we are living in a world where we have independence and privilege to do want we want in  case if the government restrict  people's choices even though that would be for the betterment of people, that would lead to public concerns such as protest or marches. A better solution for this would be to educate people about a balance diet which would enable  people to make better food choices. This technique would use in number of developing countries around the world with a positive result in terms of public health.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, considering above mentioned points it is evident that, balanced diet is the most appropriate way to deal with this situation. In my opinion, health decisions should of citizens as everyone has the rights to live their life accordingly; however, instead of enforcing the rules on the citizens the government must check the quality of food and impose the law on manufacturing of these products.",

To begin with, they can achieve a sense of experience more than people who are learning theoretical knowledge.

Meanwhile, the employees working after finishing high school educational program hand on practical experience in their job.

Secondly, studying at higher levels help people widen their knowledge as well as approach day-to-day research in depth, which will be a negative implication for their promotion.

        "essay": "21st Century brings in a lot of revolution in the job culture. Both men and women are seen participating actively in the different job domains where  only men were considered in earlier times. I believe this is a positive change in  recent times.\r\n\r\nTo start with, women are considered equal to men in terms of all work-related areas such as Multi-Nationals, Hospitals, Schools and many more we see an equal ratio of them working. This leads to women being more strong, more independent and more hardworking. The economy will be benefitted as a country will have more taxpayers and in case the huslabel or the main man of the house is not well or is out of town for his job can rely on the woman of the house for a living. For ,example in the aviation ,department we have a same number of male and female pilots or in ,hospitals we find more female doctors than male.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some old-generation thinkers consider this to be negative as they believe women are meant for the kitchen and to raise the kids. They do not allow women to go for higher education or to allow them to follow their dreams. Many force their daughters to marry soon.\r\n\r\nIn , the conclusion I believe both  communities are equal, women working in different domains will grow the economy as a whole and can educate and will raise their children better.",

        "essay": "It is argued by many individuals that there shouldn't be any taxes on their hard-earned money as they don't get many facilities from the government. This essay partially disagrees with this notion as the government need money to run the system. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, It is really painful to share our hard-earned money with the state when we don't get any direct benefits for the same. Additionally, people felt cheated when they need to pay the taxes on their every purchase when they have already paid the taxes on their income. Moreover, the system doesn't provide any financial security to them in case of any mishappening. For example, recently millions of people in India lose their job due to the Covid- 19 pandemic but none of them get any financial benefits from the state. \r\n\r\nHowever, I partially disagree with this viewpoint as we all received many indirect benefits from the government such as infrastructure, subsidies fuels, hospitals, schools and universities. Moreover, they provide a secure environment to us with the help of police and other forces. Additionally, the state runs many schemes in which poor people get subsidies food from the state. For example, Food Corporation of India has purchased 80 million ton of wheat and rice in 2019 and they have distributed this to the people who are below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, not every taxpayer may get direct benefits from the government but I believe that it is really essential to run the system smoothly and it helps everyone either directly or indirectly.",

        "essay": "It is undeniable that in certain countries occupants of houses are eager to scrutinize about the history of their houses or buildings they live in. The main reasons for this could be to identify any cultural significance and to check for any legal disputes on the property they occupy. Hence, there are a several ways to obtain such information. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, people living n these properties research the past mainly to scrutinize on any legal issues pertaining to the building. In other words, if the house has any legal disputes or court cases in the past it would certainly cause problems for the current owners. For example, there are many instances where the previous owners have gained ownership through fraudulent acts. In such instances current occupants will also be dragged into disputes. Ultimately, all parties involved will be in trouble. \r\n\r\nMoreover, some houses are built with a strong cultural and significance influence which directly enhance their market value. To illustrate this further, certain old houses in Sri Lanka have been refurbished and used to attract tourists in the Southern part of the country. In these circumstances knowing the history of a house will certainly provide the edge for the  future business oriented decisions. \r\n\r\nThus, there are a serveral avenues to search for such information. First and foremost, the property owners could obtain the assistance of the government authorities such as department of housng and lands to get legal clearence of the building.

        "essay": "Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be   beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do   not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.   Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies,   without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare   time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect   their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending   lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we   should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing   sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead   of them when they finish their studies.   At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from   obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it   goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of   people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to   resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being   used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their   children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the   best system.   In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others,   but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.",

If the company can tackle this issue, they can reduce the cost of many aspects such as taxes, human resources or even raw materials. However, they have to cope with making a commitment to consumers about the quality of products. For instance, some plants usually have a tendency to build more factories in developing countries such as China, India or even Vietnam, which can provide them with various modes of machines and wealth skilled labor market, resulting in helping them in many ways of manufacturing and assembling goods. \r\n\r\nAnother method that can be mentioned is to produce constantly a lot of high-quality products with distinctive designs and colors that can catch customers’ eyes. In addition, these products can be useful for people in terms of beauty as well as use, or they can boost the businesses’ reputation. To demonstrate, thanks to the outstanding development in many aspects mentioned, Iphone becomes a typical example of the most successful electronic devices all around the world, which have strongly contributed to the corporation’s sales over the period since they were first released to the community.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the companies adopt strategies such as product cost reduction and constant development in order to increase sales and run their businesses more comprehensively.

While there are some people argue that the governments should give most of their supports to the field that is highly effective in terms of the countrys' development, I am convinced that all the major is equally important  to be entitled the same amount of funds.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it is true that science field contributes to the major part in developing the country. To be specific, space, technology and healthcare, which is the key parts in order to make a better qulity of life are all related to scientific studies. There is no doubt that these subjects require rich materials and sometimes field placements, which is never cheap. Thus, only focusing on science field can be seen as a sound investment in that countries with advanced scientific research are guarnteed to be well-developed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I believe that other parts of the studies deserve the same level on how much the government consider the science field crucial.

        "essay": "It is argued that young adults must get involved in the local community without getting paid. While there are several benefits to such activities, these are outweighed by the drawbacks. \r\n\r\nThough young people do not receive any kind of direct remuneration, doing volunteer work may help them mentally prepare for the life of an adult. Firstly, teenage volunteers may learn to become more responsible. Most people at these ages are still heavily reliant on their parents and teachers. Therefore, taking part in community work means they are entering a new work environment with little supervision of parents and teachers; in other words, they are given a chance to stand on their own. Furthermore, helping other people can make their lives more fulfilled. It is true that the need to contribute and be recognized is universal and should not be limited to adults, and for teens through community work, this need can be met. \r\n\r\nHowever, the benefits appear less significant than the drawbacks. On the one hand, many teenagers are already burned out with schoolwork and homework, which are as demanding as a full-time job. If they are obliged to do unpaid work, this can create a negative impression that their life is nothing but duties. This suggests that the rest of their time should be spent on their hobbies to help them find school-life balance. On the other hand, as students’ time and capacity is still limited, society only gains insignificant benefit from their contribution to community work. What they can support the community at this point may be just some simple paperwork and errands, and two hours of volunteering a week, for instance, is not enough to make a change. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though it can benefit young adults to do unpaid community service to some extent, this should not be made compulsory for all.",

There are some people who think that it is better to be graduated  from a tertiary institution in order to be employed while others advocate that start working immediately after  elementary learning is paramount. In my opinion, the higher degree gives an upper hand to have  reputed employment since this already proves that the candidate is sufficiently equipped to work in a particular post.\r\n\r\n The first and foremost fact is that when a job seeker with degree certificates would more likely to be  hired as a person who has thorough knowledge in that field, when compared to one who just passed secondary school. In other words,  education itself shows  how efficient this potential employee is. For example,  many international companies, their deployment is purely based on the academic background. Therefore, this can be harmful to those who have  only basic learning.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is that even though it is possible to secure a job with  minimum education, future career development can be slim since they did not  have theoretical background. Similarly, the pay increment also based on the position which they are in, it is unlikely to be counted  the number of years they are in the field. The class-four worker, for instance, has many years of experience, but there is a huge difference in salary of his and a newly hired manager of the same organisation. Thus,  advancement is  strictly dealt with the level of qualifications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people have a different opinion on whether joining in a work-sector after a basic study or  to be graduated before searching an occupation.

This essay agrees with the statement because attending a single-gender school will cause problems in their personal and professional lives. \r\n\r\nDue to very less communication with the opposite sex, one’s professional life is affected badly. A friend of mine, Maya, went to only-girls school and grew up to be shy and weak. Maya’s shyness makes her colleagues and boss feel that she is not capable of performing under cruel circumstances and hence not provide her any challenging tasks. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institutions, have proven to perform excellently under any critical situations. Hence, individuals who did not attend co-ed institutions are not able to grow and develop professionally.\r\n\r\nNot only careerwise, but also single-sex school students suffer loss in personal lives in their adulthood. Opposite-sex shyness is proven to be one of the reason of anxiety and depression. But people who were mixed-gender schooled, have better social as well as personal lives.

        "essay": "Going to university is an important step in life. It will majorly impact their futurs, and will define them in many ways. Unfortunatly, this is an expensive task that not everyone can afford. Thit is the reason why some people think that governments should pay course fees for university students. In this essay, I will explain why I think governments should help students of universities financially by paying their course fees.\r\nTo begin with, this could make universities more inclusive and help some students achieve their dreams. Some people, due to their economic background, are forced to attend specific establishments, even though they would give anything to be somewhere else. This is an important cause of class differences, and the source of many disciminations today. This is why, offering to pay for their course fees, would considerably help students that are less wealthy, and fight against inequalities.\r\nTo illustrate this argument, here is an example. Some of my class-mates receive a specific amount of money from an organization, that helps them study at my shool. They find it amazing because, now they are not only defined by their parents' income anymore, and they have the opportunity to accomplish whatever they wish in life.\r\nSecondly, an enormous amount of students live in a precarous situation, so by paying their course fees they could have a more stable life. University life is rough, you are not with your family, you have to manage so many different things for the first time, one of which being money. Some students have little to no money that they can spend in recreational activities, a big part of it being assigned to accomodations, school fees and food. By paying some of their fees, students could benefit from the money and do what they enjoy. This could help them mentally and make them enjoy life a bit more.\r\nOn the other hand, I can understand that if governments had to pay for the course fees of every students, it would represent a tremendous amount of money that could be invested in other and more pressing matters. Although, I do still think that providing this aid could have more benefits than downsides.\r\nIn conclusion, the governments shoulp help students by paying their course fees.

        "essay": "Nowadays,when our society is in the stage of rapid technological development, some people consider art as an useless lesson for children at school,while others support that it is important to have knowledge in this field. It is agreed, that children should be aware of different subjects and art is not an exception. This essay,firstly,will discuss why the idea of an uselessness of this field is common these days,followed by an analysis of abilities and values which these lessons have.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, people strongly believe that  art has been seen as a waste of time,since technologies progress and influence our lives. Undoubtedly, it is important to have an awareness of modern gadgets,therefore children should be provided with computer classes. In addition, some parents have a desire to teach their kids more in science or math,because of the growing need for experts in these fields of study. Moreover, they worry about children's future incomes and they keep them restricted from  art,due to the fact that an artist is a low-paid work position.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  art is considered to be one of the most important subjects at school,because it develops imagination ,which will definitely have a positive impact on the future. For example, such jobs as architects, advertising or content managers and photographers to name a few, require workers with  highly developed creativity. Moreover, as we live in an era of innovations, a lot of new work opportunities appear and for instance,digital artists are highly paid. Nevertheless, not only the future is the main factor of the value of art,but also the importance of saving  humanity's historical heritage. Furthermore, each individual should have knowledge in different fields of study to keep their personality versatile.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,this essay agrees with the point of view that despite  the importance of other subjects,  art should be included in the list of school lessons, due to its undeniable value.",

        "prompt": "Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Economic growth has become one of the top priorities of every state around the world. However, some experts believe that rich countries with any additional increase in economic wealth are unable to create more satisfaction for their citizens. Personally, I hold a different perspective on this notion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is argued that individuals from improved societies may not experience greater pleasure because of the heavy workload. Due to the tasks of expanding the economy, businesses are required to boost their productivity and foster innovative progress, leading to increased working hours. Therefore, people may have less time for leisure activities, causing a rise in stress and pressure which are the two main indicators when measuring the happiness index in a certain country. For example, despite being the most developed economy in the world, the U.S. has the highest suicide rate globally.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am of the opinion that a growth in the economy is positively associated with greater happiness for several reasons. Firstly, it is undoubtedly that individuals from rich countries have a higher living standard, including better living conditions with modern facilities and more chances to access the top education system and the world-class healthcare system. As a result, the world has witnessed a huge flow of people from underdeveloped and developing regions migrating to developed countries with the hope of a brighter future. Secondly, with a prosperous economy, weahlthy nations can have more resources to overcome social issues, including unemployment, environmental demage and inequality. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, while poorer countries were struggling to meet their residents' basic needs such as food, medicine and accommodation, citizens from richer ones can easily overcome the pandemic thanks to financial support from their governments.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though a rise in the economy can lead to a more stressful workload, I firmly assert that this development contributes significantly to individuals' fulfilment thanks to a higher living standard and social issues being addressed. It is advisable that countries should continously improve their economies to enhance the happiness of their citizens.",

        "prompt": "The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?",
        "essay": "Nowadays protection of the world environment is becoming a priority for  several concerned people. The extent of consuming products is increasing day by day which poses a great threat to this modern world, in terms of  land and air pollution. This essay will discuss two main reasons including an increased quantity of wastage and scarcity of organic resources and some solutions to address this overarching issue.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons can be considered responsible for polluting the current ecosystem. Firstly, the waste of products has increased at an exponential rate because of the industrial revolution that the world has observed in recent years. Selling a huge amount of one-time-use bottles by beverage companies is the best illustration of this thing. These canes are a big part of the problem of landfill. In addition, factories are using more and more natural resources. This not only results in depletion of organic fuel but also carbon particles are rising tremendously. It is, therefore, two main factors which are contributing to destroying numerous habitats.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite these issues being significant, a variety of measures can be taken to mitigate these obvious problems. To begin with, recycling is one of the best ways to tackle this issue. For example, plastic bottles, and aluminium canes can be used again for repackaging. This activity could reduce the problem of the waste quantity of useless things. Another way is that a handsome amount of profit made by industries could be consumed to save the environment. This can be achieved by building recycling plants along with the introduction of green belts around factories to trap carbon particles from polluted air, released by industries. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the negative consequences of consumerism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this essay discussed two major factors that could play a crucial role in increasing trash and how this phenomenon can be dealt with by introducing the culture of recycling and using money from the industrial sector to build green sections around them to purify the air.",

        "prompt": "Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called \"peer pressure\". Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages.",
        "essay": "In  contemporary society, young individuals who have been subject to peer pressure may have begun to demonstrate emotional and behavioural changes. While this type of pressure can help teens consolidate their behaviour and their performance in the classroom, I assume that it can also have an adverse bearing on their mental health.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that through regular interaction with constructive examples and perspectives of peers, who are in a similar age group or social status, the primary benefit for young students is the possibility of forming and maintaining frequent academic practices. Those adolescents tend to take others, especially those with whom they have admiration, as role models. Consequently, the presence of positive role models boosts the likelihood of academic and even social achievement among young pupils. For example, observing a peer’s success in a prestigious intellectual competition, such as Road to Mount Olympia - a well-known competition for outstanding students to showcase their intelligence - can motivate other students to study industriously and enhance their performance at school.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I believe that the adverse effects of peer pressure  on an individual's mental well-being overshadow its benefits. It is worth noting that this tendency can increase stress levels in the young, which in turn can make them feel inadequate or become reticent when expressing their opinions and personal ideas. If a sense of anxiety and depression persists without proper adjustment, this can result in the suicide of many emotionally driven young people, a very undesirable outcome. For example, in 2022, a Vietnamese boy committed suicide by jumping off a tall building as a form of protest against his father’s insistence that he studied for a long period of time at the expense of sleep and entertainment. He was so pressured by his father and peers to perform outstandingly in school as well as gain a respectable university in Hanoi that he made an impulsive decision to end his life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, peer pressure has the potential to be a positive force for reinforcing personal abilities,however,I personally believe that its highly devastating impact on students’ mentality.",

        "prompt": "Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "Globally, governments are facing a lot of environmental problems due to usage of hydrocarbon fuel. The more fuel is used, the higher the effects of environmental problem. Although a quick solution to lower the fuel usage is to increase the cost of fuel, I disagree with this statement for 2 reasons.\r\n\r\n Firstly, increasing the cost of fuel will only lead to higher cost of living. Corporations and business owners will absorb the high price of fuel and pass on the high cost back to consumers. This will increase the price of goods and services that they provide as they would need to maintain their profit margin. End users will have to bear the higher cost of living.\r\n\r\n Secondly, these environmental problems can only be reduced if usage of fuel is reduced. Rather than increasing the fuel price, government must provide the facility and incentives to develop alternatives to fuel. A tax concession for companies that explore and produce alternative energy is a powerful way to do this. It is of great benefit for companies to chase these tax concession to provide alternative fuel to customers, thus decreasing fuel usage while increasing their profits.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, increasing fuel price will only lead to other problems. Government must look at ways to reduce the fuel usage through exploring alterative fuel, and not by increasing the cost, as this will lead to higher cost of living",

        "essay": "The lack of accommodation has become a serious urban social issue in many metropolitan areas of the world. It has been argued that only the leaders of the countries can tackle this problem. In my opinion, without the supporting from other parties, the government could not cope well with the housing shortage.\r\nIt cannot be denied that country management system plays a vital role in many of our lives, but nevertheless government intervention would hamper the private sector. For instance, the supply of urban spaces is constrained by locally controlled land use plans that make the property developers difficult to build housing in the places where it is most highly valued—in dense urban settings. Although, there’s a growing demand for urban living. Given its role in attracting public consumption and accelerating economic development, the real estate industry should be at the mercy of the market, rather than the government.\r\nAnother drawback of state control over the housing market is that it could pose a huge burden upon the state. The government has borne the funding for various affordable public housing programs, and concern has arisen because of the poor condition of the surrounding environment, traffic connectivity and numerous other social and service facilities like schools, markets, or hospitals. For example, most of social flats are outside the expensive centre of Ho Chi Minh, the social housing projects may boast affordable price tags even to low-income groups, but ultimately the long commute between home and work rendered this to become a disadvantage. Consequently, the programme of building a large amount of public housing will probably heavily burden a country.\r\nTo conclude, I believe that governments play an important role in meeting basic housing demands of individuals, but the joint effort of both government and private sector is required.",

        "essay": "In the modern world, there are opinions that the government should ensure the healthy lifestyle of people. While people argue that the government should play a main role in this, others think that such decisions are an individual responsibility. In my opinion, while the government should provide guidance and support, individuals must control their own lifestyle choices by self.\r\n\r\nLook at the first opinion on this question, who advocate for government intervention argue that public health initiatives can have benefits in the future. The government can create an environment conducive to healthier living. For instance, increasing taxes on unhealthy products like sugary drinks and fast food reduces the number of conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Also, public health campaigns and subsidized gym memberships can promote healthier habits, leading to improvements in the well-being of the population.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is an opinion that a healthy lifestyle is an individual responsibility. Decisions about one's lifestyle should rest with the individual, as personal choice fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment. Also, individuals have diverse  preferences, and a universal approach may not be suitable for everyone. For example, some individuals may find traditional gym workouts boring and choose alternative forms of exercise like yoga or martial arts. As a result, individuals make their own choices and a more personalized approach to health can be better.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the government should play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to decide their own choices. By providing guidance, support, and access to information, the government can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health. Government intervention and personal autonomy should be in balance to reach a healthy society.",

        "prompt": "Some people believe that the goverment sholud take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their retirement.\r\nWhat is your opinion? Is it a postive or negative development?",
        "essay": "In this fast changing world era, every age-group need certain facilities for their survival. Although half the population believes that people should get government support after retirement,on the contrary, feels that they want everyone to save money for their future while they are working.I will shine on both sides. In my opinion, taking care of old people is important for society and government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo accompany, there are many reasons why some people consider against providing facilities such as financial help to retirees. First, the government can introduce more development projects that help improve the economy and development of the country rather than giving people beneficial services after retirement. For example, the latest studies prove that many nations ban facilities after retirement and focus more on developing valuable public projects. In addition, it is seen that sometimes relatives or others cheat on retired people to get money for their service. This is why some people may not get these benefits\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, nowadays, due to more competition in every field, survival has become relatively difficult. First and foremost, after a certain age, people lose their physical strength and are unable to do labor work such as working as a laborer in factories and drivers etc. Therefore, in this situation they need financial support for basic needs of home, shoes, clothes and food etc.Additionally, in today's world, there are some sons and daughters who leave their parents alone, the government needs to build more old age homes where they get proper basic needs and care. Even the rapidly increasing cost of living and food items adversely affects older people who do not have sufficient savings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo demolish the whole notion, I gather that retired people contributed their lives for the development of society. Therefore, after retirement, it is the duty of society and government to take care of these people and ensure their better survival.",

While it is thought by a group of masses that private schools brings more advantages, other hold opposing view and deem that it have some drawbacks for community. I accord that it have both positive and negative aspect, which i will discuss in my further paragraphs. \r\n\r\nThere are some some benefits of attaing private education. First is teachers are well-educated there and they have the responsibility of every single student regarding study. Apart from this pupils can learn best knowledgeable things from private education Centers, that will make their future secure and choose their Intetsing or suitable professions. In this way they would not be suffered in further life for finding jobs. Another positive thing is that schools provide best labs of science and computer including libraries and buses Itselves. So that learners and parents can remain satisfied or comfortable. More specifically, competition also organized there so that students can polish their quilities and their confidence aslo enhance.\r\n\r\nHowever,First is poor individuals cannot afford fees of private schools, because if any parents want to admission in this centers, first of all they have to huge amount of expense for this. So only affluent people can arrange handsome amounts of money for admission. Another wayout is that private schools do some unnecessary activities from pupils, in which they need to spend funds, different types of projects given by teachers and some lower age students unable to make these, then their parents make them or tuition mentors. Therefore. These are the disadvantage of private schools. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, although private schools have some negative as these are inflected school and give unnecessary work to students in which they have to spend money , it have some positive also in terms of providing best infrastructure and pay attention to every pupil. I think these are just depend on person situation like they are rich or poor.",

        "essay": "It is true that growing business and cultural contacts are part of the modern process of globalisation. While some people mourn the loss of national identity which they believe occurs as a result of this process, I disagree with that view on the basis that it is important to embrace change and accept new realities. \r\nThe expansion of business and cultural exchanges across the world is a positive feature of contemporary life. Companies have broken into new markets by doing market research and taking into consideration local differences in consumer demands and preferences. They introduce new products without dismissing traditional ideas. The appearance, for example, of McDonald’s fast food outlets in Malaysia, China or Vietnam is not incompatible with the success of restaurants serving time-honoured cuisine. Such innovations do not necessarily mark the disappearance of traditional ways of life and to accept new customs is to extend choice for every consumer. \r\nThus, it is an exaggeration to maintain that these developments will lead to the loss of a strong sense of identity in countries. For example, people in many former colonial nations have embraced change, but they still proudly preserve traditional cultural traits. In India, English - the language of the former colonial power - is widely spoken, but this has not led to the disappearance of local languages or indigenous cultural practices. Therefore, joining modern culture does not always mean that national or local customs have to be alabeloned. On the contrary, enforced isolation from trade and cultural contacts with other countries will have the inevitable consequence of withdrawal from all the changes taking place globally. \r\nIn conclusion, I would argue that the growth of contacts in commerce and culture is a positive development which will not destroy national identities.",

In my understanding, the former nation holds true subsequent paragraphs will discuss both viewpoints in detail.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons why people think that offensive movies and video games should be banned. Primarily, it has a negative psychological impact especially on youngsters. To elucidate, it has been observed that when these minors watch violent videos on  television continuously, this would leave a detrimental influence on their minds. As a result, unconsciously they start tackling  real-life situations with rude behaviour. for instance, my nephew is keen to spend time on PlayStation, which has adversely affected his habitual attitude to deal with others. Another concerning factor is it results in amplifying the crime rate in present times. As these types of programmes are full of many new illegal activities, this provokes the criminals to follow the advanced methodologies to break the law.\r\n\r\nHowever, these conflicting sources are having a few advantages. First of all, it works as a stress buster for the young population. To elaborate, when people get off from a hectic day at work, then watching these innovative and unique movies is helping in providing relief from monotonous work life. Moreover, it enhances cognitive ability and scientific temper in  young ones at an early age. If children observe detective movies and action games within certain limit, then this would  not only boost knowledge related to applications of science but also develops their mental wellness. In India, for example,students who consider these shows and games up to some extent are having bright futures in the science field.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, despite the fact that such violent games and  films have merits in terms of brain excellence and relieving stress, one must consider the demerits which are alarming.

        "essay": "With globalization, nations are more interconnected than ever before, giving rise to urgent and complex dilemmas on a global scale, some argue that international assistance is essential in addressing the majority of these pressing issues. I agree with this viewpoint.\r\n\r\nCertain urgent problems can only be effectively addressed through collaboration with other countries. For instance, in the aftermath of a conflict, residents often find themselves grappling with injuries, homelessness, food and water shortages, and even threats to their lives. Moreover, in such dire situations, local governments may lack the resources and capabilities to provide swift and comprehensive solutions. Therefore, international support becomes paramount. Whether through organizations or the governments of other nations, it plays a crucial role in safeguarding human rights. Such help may involve rescuing the affected population, supplying essential resources, and offering overseas shelter to refugees.\r\n\r\nConversely, not all urgent problems necessitate external intervention, as seen in the case of crime rates. Persistent and multifaceted concerns, like crime, are intricately linked to various domestic factors such as education, employment, and the efficacy of legal policies. Consequently, the responsibility lies squarely with domestic authorities to institute long-term solutions rather than relying solely on international aid. Nevertheless, seeking advice from other nations can serve as a valuable reference for improving local strategies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while international collaboration is undeniably a potent method for addressing urgent challenges, the capacity of local governments should not be underestimated. The dynamics of each issue determine whether it requires a global or domestic approach. Striking a balance between international cooperation and local autonomy is essential for fostering effective solutions on a global scale.",

Many poeple are enthusiastic with such innovation, while others are not as much interested. This essay will essentially provide a discuss of the topic, followed by a final opinion supporting the discussion.\r\nPurchasing items on the web is a tending thing to put into consideration. The huge tendency to get whatever basically required from a click of a finger is blessing for many. Such facility had enabled disabled people to get access to millions of global shopping markets with their varieties. In addition, it had proven its efficiency among the massive liquidity and momentum from overseas markets and local marketing agencies, in addition to the enormous numbers of online purchasers. For instance, getting a basic need from a grocery had become much more simple than getting to step out to the next building store. The absolute advantageous effect of this trend feature will benifit this generation, and the next, which will seem unprecedented.\r\nOn the other hand, despite the fact that the pros firmly outweighs the cons; they could sound quite frankly heavy to tolerate. Many dark facts of such virtual store system must be clarified. One fact is the delivery system. Late delivery could cause catastrophic consequences. Poor shipping as well is a jeopardizing negative issue. For example, One month ago, I have personally ordered from a famous well-known store in my region. The usual shipping time was stated to be form 3 - 5 days at most. With all respect. They never respected their delivery date expected, urging me to wait a period of 30 days with no exaggeration. However, other customers could have complained to the court and asked for their right, but i was much more tolerant and patient.\r\nA good summary suggest, that how much was this online trading circle wide , popular and efficient. There must be some dark facts and troubles that in fact, could be solved. Ultimately, I suggest that this innovation will contain the global markets dramatically, getting a long ride to a store a forgettable thing.",

        "prompt": "More people decide to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?\r\nDo advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?",
        "essay": "With the progression of the society, many people do their family planning in their thirties rather than twenties which was common a decade ago. This essay will discuss positives and drawbacks of this trend and which outweighs the other.\r\n\r\nAs people have turned extremely ambitious these days, they prefer achieving their goals and indulge into starting a family later. This priority shift not only help them focus and earn huge amount of money to make them self sufficient, but it also helps to financially support the future generation in a better way. For instance, financially independent parents are able to provide a better lifestyle for their children than those who are unstable in their careers.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, ageing brings vulnerability of severe health issues in a person's life. By the same token, pregnancy becomes complicated at the later stage, both for a man and a woman. A recent research concluded that, the probability of conceiving in couples is reduced by 23% after they touch their thirties and can further be declined up to 53% over the age of thirty five. Secondly, individuals do not remain fit enough to support their children, if the age gap between the parents and child is big. For example, if a child is born when a man is forty five, his child would be only twenty and not financially independent at the man's retirement age. Hence, the family might need extra financial aids to support the children.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, they are few advantages to starting a family late such as a child can be provided better financial aid to support his life, the disadvantages are more and it outweighs the advantages as the complications in conceiving can increase with a person's age and the generation gap between progenitors and their children is huge which can become a major issue in future.",

While some people see that it is an\r\n\r\nexcellent alternative to getting an ideal job, it is an excellent alternative to getting an ideal job. There is a big gap between the college and business so I personally believe that students need to work after school due to multiple reasons.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, On the one hand, it could be understood that some are aware of the difficulty of promotion\r\n\r\n for workers without bachelor's degrees because certificates are initially required by recruiters. Accordingly, some people could see that being on university graduate would be the safe way to get an ideal job, as evident on the labor market in 2021 in some Asian countries. There was around 30% of graduated students had their salary expectation after two years of work experience. Moreover, this activity significantly provides more of their major's knowledge which would be helpful in offices. In Vietnam, fortunately, over 38% of graduated learners work on their right business degrees.\r\n\r\nAlthough on the other hand, business experience after high school would help people save time and reduce their personal economic burden. In many nations, college fees could be probably an installment debt for the rest of their life. It might be a serious problem in some risky\r\n\r\nsituations such as the Covid – 19 pandemic, recessions, so on (you should not write like this ... you can write \"so on\" unless they have enough time to work and save in order to own their funds. Besides, they start to contributing to their career based on their\r\n\r\n experiences, and the more experienced workers get,the higher position required. For example, instead of graduating, people could start to observe and learn from colleagues in the business market and then continue myriad projects during the first 2 years, followed by contributing their own projects and promote to a higher position in the next 2 years.\r\n\r\nEventually, In conclusion, it is an unchallenged choice when people could learn further appreciate\r\n\r\nknowledge base in subjects.

This ,  in this , the essay I'm going to say what I believe in this matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is no way to create a machine that can replicate how the human minds work. Scientists themself fund the human mind as unique and a miracle. However, robots taking jobs are possible. For instance, efforts like customer service, security. Moreover, This work does not require a lot of effort and could be automated because these tasks do not require any skills at all. To illustrate,for  a job like customer service the employee should follow the easy steps. For that, the robot will not face problems that require human interference and it should be automated.\r\n\r\nSecondly, To make a machine work or understand a thing you have to feed it with a huge amount of information. Moreover, it takes years of researching and trying to make a robot do one single job that people takes among others. For example, Scientists from MIT published a paper saying that about machines. Such as, Siri took years to develop and it could not match how humans think or respond and it will take many years to be a good speaker as anybody.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I don't think that machine is going to take over peoples career.

Usually, humans are curious to learn more about historical facts and cities’ architecture may be a good way to understand them. Since finding information is not always an easy task, people who are willing to go further on this research should visit the City Hall of their city to start. \r\n\r\nStudying the architecture of certain place is a good way to understand more about history, especially when it comes to culture in general, such as traditions and religion costumes. The architecture is a mutable art that changes according to the period of time and region, so it could be the most important feature to understand the background of a specific location. For example, the architecture of the Roman Empire, one of the biggest empires in history, can be seen in several European countries, so by analyzing houses or buildings, people can have a sense of plenty historical facts that are related to this empire, like time, important battles, and culture. Therefore, analyzing the surrounding architecture of a site is an incredible source to learn history, but knowing where to start the research is also very important. \r\n\r\n\tIn order to find out historical information related to the architecture of certain place, people can reach out to the city-Hall managers.

        "essay": "Some individuals think that the best way to achieve career success is to study at university or college but many people think the best way is to get a job right after graduating from high school. In my opinion, I will discuss two sides and give my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, going straight to work is a pretty good option. Students will have more time to learn. For example, after graduating from high school, students who choose to work will have more time to know if they like this job or if it is suitable for them, which will help them have a lot of experience to really find a job that's right for them. In addition, going to work early will help young people earn and save a lot of money. For instance, people who go to work early will accumulate a lot of money and they use that money to buy things for their family, shop for themselves and raise their own families. However, sometimes people who go straight to work will find it harder to succeed than those who go to college or university. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, choosing to go to university or college before getting a job is the best one. They will have the knowledge to help them succeed in their work. For instance, students after completing four years of college will pick up enough knowledge to help them get a good job and a high salary. Doing this way will have a high rate of job success and they can start their own business. Moreover, sophomores and juniors have the option of looking for part-time work. For example, during their studies, there are part-time jobs related to their major, from which they accumulate a lot of experience to support them after they graduate. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, studying at a university or college is an insight choice because it will help a lot when young people are looking for a job for themselves.

Example - Nowadays, people have started scripting daily soaps on biographies of a person or a crime series which is based on a true story.\r\n\r\nCategorisation - Earlier children's were not been able to choose from variety of programs and had to be a part of a family daily soaps. Having said that, those daily soaps were not meant for their ages. However, due to the increase in number of programs on television. Children's can watch series/programs of their category which suits their preferences and IQ.\r\n\r\nIncrease in numbers of the Television programs also have its affects such as their quality deteriorates and many more. I'd like to discuss some below:\r\n\r\nOff-track - Every daily soaps and their channels try to produce and present the best which their competitors are delivering, though they sometimes go obnoxiously wrong and portrays something which they even didn't wanted to.\r\n\r\nCommercialization - TV programs have been focussing on increased ratings and earning more money, irrespective of the quality they offer.\r\n\r\nConfusion - Enormous collection of programs on television has actually made people confused. Public is actually confused to watch which programs based on their genres preferences.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, more Television programs definitely gives freedom to choose from but still, the best TV programs restricts to very few of them because quality of the daily soaps decreases drastically. Therefore, lesser the number, lower the confusion and bests options to choose from.",

        "essay": "Many people argue that companies should focus on their employee’s performance for achieving tasks rather than noticing the way they dress. Does an employee's dressing really matter for identifying his work quality? I do not agree with this notion . I believe that focusing on employees’ working efficiency will not only encourage positive competition among staff, but it will also help to increase the financial growth of a company. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDressing appropriately is primarily important when a firm has a staff of diverse cultures. Firstly, people from various ethnicities wear different apparels which not only represent their traditions and religions, but they will also show their attachment with their norms. Secondly, employers need to understand that there would be significant consequences if they ignore a standard dress code. For example, wearing an unethical dress such as a short skirt can be mentally challenging for a Muslim girl who is working on the same floor as it is against their cultural and religious beliefs.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSimilarly, executives' efforts to have acceptable clothing in the workplace will also enhance working efficiency. If employers give freedom for dresses then people might be focusing on fashion, talking about different apparel brands and shopping malls, which in result can cause significant damage to business efficiency as people will be spending too much time on these activities. So, businesses should try to develop scenarios where productivity is maximized rather than encouraging an activity such as dress freedom which can harm them in the long term. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we discussed how cultural awareness can be appreciated when business executives focus on employees' working dresses , and how a healthy working environment can be created by focusing on personal choices such as wearing dresses and jewellery.",

        "essay": "There are numerous arguments for and against whether retirees should take the responsibility of themselves or should it be the government responsibility to financial support them. In my opinion, though self-care promotes a culture of saving, it is government’s duty to ensure part of their welfare and health with financial support.\r\n\r\nPeople who are opposed to government financial support are of the opinion that, the culture of saving rather than depending on the government may boost the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government, as a result, the government would be able to plan more funds for more productive purposes such as, development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which might expedite the overall enhancement of a country.\r\n\r\nAlthough I recognize the legitimate merits to the argument above, I would generally side with those who believe the government should allocate part of its budget as a repayment to financial support of retirees in order to provide welfare and comfort. As retirees age, those suffering from various disease including, Parkinson, diabetes and osteoporosis, become more needy of monthly checkup. If their health is taken into consideration, the government should provide them more comprehensive financing assistance, like health insurance, cheaper loans and expenses of care and nursing. on the other hand, it is said that all individuals are paying taxes for years because of their civic duty and in contrast the government duty is included giving financial support when needed especially after retirement.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion، although some believe that it is retirees’ duty to take care of themselves, others think government should shoulders the responsibility of retirement finance.

        "essay": "Nowadays, some people assume that occupations might be substituted progressively by artificial robots in the future. In my opinion, although a majority of simple jobs will be done by robots ultimately, it is impossible that positions which require human relations can be replaced. This essay will discuss the reasons why only particular jobs will be finally taken over.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, artificial robots will easily overtake the jobs that do not require specific and complex human skills in the workforce. From a cost point of view, many companies will choose to use artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than training and employing a human. Cashiers in supermarket, for instance, are gradually being replaced by checkout machines that cost far less than employees. Customers can easily pay for their goods by using self-checkout facilities rather than standing in a long queue to wait for services at a counter. For these reasons, using artificial robots can be a significantly effective way for companies. \r\n\r\nConversely, there are some complicated human jobs that will never be overtaken by robotic intelligence because robots do not have the capacities to achieve. In other words, some particular occupations require complex and critical thinking that only human brain can do. For example, science-related jobs, such as doctors, scientists, pharmacists, engineers, can only be carried out by the professionals, even in the future. Robots will not be able to sort out all of the problems which need to be overcome by human. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, with the development of advanced technology, it is no doubt that robots have the abilities to replace a significant number of occupations in the near future. Unskilled labour will eventually be done by machines entirely; however, some sophisticated fields that require specific and complicated human skills will always exist. Consequently, occupations in particular professional areas will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent world.",

        "essay": "Providing affordable healthcare and education that can improve the quality of life is a priority for authorities. A country could invest money to offer health services that meet quality criteria. For instance, senior medical staff spends extra money to improve the quality of care and patient safety by reducing maternity and newborns mortality caused due to inadequate medication or unhygienic infrastructure. Administration in educational institutions consumes money to make it more accessible to a well-developed education system. That is to say, preparing a structured curriculum and hiring professional teachers contribute mainly to graduate skilled alumni for decent job opportunities. Thus, quality national health coverage and education boost public health and employability.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, education and health are not more crucial than the arts. Art illustrates great importance in self-expression and fulfillment. In other words, art is the same as the language in describing imagination and ideas. Painting, sculpture, music, and literature are mediums that an artist chooses for his craft to convert his feelings and thoughts into tangible objects people can see and touch.

        "essay": "In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well.

However, others are even concerned about the historical traces of their accommodation buildings. This essay will discuss some key reasons behind this tendency and suggest a multitude of ways to uncover a property’s past.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible factors contributing to people’s inclination towards such investigation. From a spiritual perspective, people in some countries heavily practice feng shui, a pseudoscientific traditional practice originating from ancient China and this is the first reason for their curiosity about their housing history. They are concerned about which directions their accommodations are facing and the owners’ happiness even rest on the arrangement of everything in their living space, including trees. They believe anything that is misplaced is to blame for people’s mishaps. To illustrate, Vietnamese people frequently visit a feng shui master before deciding how to construct their homes. If any family refuses to follow this custom, their neighbours may all have a sense of schadenfreude if there is any misfortune that happens to so-called stubborn householders. From a practical perspective, the reason why home owners want to discover architectural history of these accommodations is rooted in the fact that they want to evaluate its condition for better preservation. Any long-lasting building may need a lot of refurbishment such as repairing a rundown roof or cracked walls, a dangerous electrical system or an ineffective sewage system. \r\n\r\nThere are probably three main ways that real estate owners use to find out the history of their house. The most directed method to adopt is asking former land owners who can supply a source of abundant and reliable information about the building. No one can know as well about the architecture as the people using to settle in it. However, in case one is not able to contact previous settlers, it is possible to query dwellers living around the house. Information namely when the house was constructed, what happened to people living in the place before can be obtained by this way. The last but not least, it is the library that can possibly offer an assortment of estate records in the region. Those are land ownerships, rehabilitation records and untold stories that may be found in these materials. All one needs to do is to spend a couple of days in the regional library to seek relevant documents when precise information cannot be retrieved by the former two methods.\r\n\r\nAll in all, one can see that spiritual elements and cultural values are the two main reasons that draw people’s interest in investigating the history of the house or building they live in.",

        "essay": "Education in a general  is the first priority of  the most governments in  the nations. the mintry of education in many countries continuosly develop programes to improve and enhance the level of education. one of these programs is a literacy of all adults. In this essay, I agree that the governments should allocate all the resourese required to erase the illilteracy of young people.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind that the governments has to pay attention to this issue is the benefits that will gain from supporting this program. One of these benifets,  it will reduse the unemployment people and give them an opprtunity  to contribute and build thier community. for example, Japan has decleard officially in 2015 that it's reach to zero level of this matter.

        "essay": "Parents play an imperative role in the grooming and upbringing of their children,however,when it comes to deciding the best school for them which not only provides an ecstatic learning environment but also moulds their personality in accordance with the norms and values of the society,some opt for uni-sex institutes while other prefers co-learning facilities.Many individuals have a notion that sending kids to single-sex school have drawbacks which become obvious later in life and I wholly agree with this.This essay will discuss both the positives and the negatives of this crucial decision which parents take with uttermost care.\r\n\r\n          In this fast-paced world,it is mandatory for youngsters to cope with it so that they not only turn out to be shrewd but also competent.This is only possible if they are provided with the latest innovations and a challenging environment to grow.Hence,multi-sex institutes assist them to interact with not only children of diverse cultures but also of the opposite sex,contributing significantly to their cognitive learning.Moreover,they become habitual in studying and working in pairs and groups including both  boys and girls,subsequently,they feel optimistic and comfortable in adulthood.For example,an article revealed that students graduating from uni-sex colleges are nervous in the presence of female colleagues at the workplace,affecting their performance drastically.\r\n\r\n      Furthermore,there are a few obvious pitfalls of sending children to  single-sex institutes.Firstly,they lack the essential exposure required at a young age  to comprehend the needs and emotions of those of different gender.Secondly,it is important to stay not only calm but also relaxed in the company of others,however,they become agitated and confused with such exposure later on in life.Nevertheless,i surmise that the benefits of co-education are mammoth whereas the disadvantages are rather few only and vice versa\r\n\r\n     To conclude,this dissertation discussed the role of parents in selecting the school for their kids.Many people think that there are many downsides to sending them to the same gender schools like lack of confidence,peculiar behaviour when accompanied by different gender and inability to perform optimally at work.I completely agree with this notion.",

        "essay": "The number of juvenile delinquencies has been increasing in recent years. It is said that young offenders should have the same treatment as their adult counterparts. In my opinion, although doing so can be beneficial to an extent, i completely disagree with this statement for number of reasons which will be outlined below\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that treating juvenile criminals the same way as adult ones will bring more justice to the victims' families. For example: when a juvenile delinquent commits a serious crime, such as murder, and is only given a light sentence, it will make the families of victims feel resentful because the punishment for their loved ones' deaths is not justified. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are 2 disadvantages to treating criminals the same regardless or their ages. Firstly, juvenile law-breakers are unaware of the consequences of the acts they have performed. They still have not acquired an adequate amount of knowledge to understand that their action may cause harms for others. As a result, I believe that prisons should act as a method to teach them right from wrong rather than punish them harshly for what they have done. Secondly, incarcerating young offenders for a long makes it harder for them to find a job when they are released. Therefore, there's a high chance that they will be imprisoned again since nobody wants to recruit them and it is impossible for them to make a living. In fact, a recent report from a police department in the US showed that 80% of juvenile delinquent return to prisons after they are freed. This statistics indicates that a mistake can cost young offenders their lives if treated similarly to adult ones\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although making young offenders receive a similar treatment as their older counterparts can be more justified towards the victims' families, i believe that they should be given a chance to learn from their mistakes",

        "essay": "In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.\r\nTo begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.\r\nOn the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should\r\nnot diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.\r\nFinally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.\r\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future.",

        "essay": "Over the last century, the population has grown at an exponential rate across many countries in the world. This transformation delivers some problems in humans, such as poverty, starving, lack of health facilities, and unemployment. As a result, I personally believe that every polity must prioritize its country before spending money on international aid. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some reasons why every nation must accentuate its country before help foreigner. Firstly, every nation has limited budget to solve such problems in its homeland. From this budget, all of the states also must have reserve funds to overcome some calamities, whether they are incidentals or not. China, the new emerging one, has giant allocation and can invest it to expertise all of the citizens. Secondly, governments be accused to have attention to help their citizens for better occupation. Moreover, governments must allocate some money to train their people and give some of their facilities. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is understandable and reasonable to donate some fund to poorer nations as a gesture of decency and humanity. No country, can live in prosperity while others, especially neighbourhood, which live below the poverty line. By offering other states, some financial assistance, the official also can elude illegal immigrant. For instance, some of the Mexicans go to the United States because they are difficult to survive. Even so, I think the instruments must prioritize their public. Therefore, they only donate some fund if their institution has sufficient budget. \r\nIn conclusion, there are some obvious benefits when some nation assisted other foreign polity with donating money as relief aids. However, I strongly iterate that the government must improve the economic, financial and employment prospects of its own people before embarking on humanitarian work abroad",

While others and I disagree with the idea and think that there are more vital threats. In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one of the reasons that folk say that research should focus on handling health problems is that these days, there are numerous new illnesses emerging all the time. To illustrate, Covid-19 that is spreading out currently is a disease that humans have not known before. As a result, we have to do research to invent the vaccine to deal with this disease. Moreover, individuals would like to have a longer life. In other words, at present, the average lifetime of humans is seventy years old. Therefore, If medicines and medical treatments are more enhanced, humans will have a longer life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the obvious reason that some people believe that there are more crucial problems is that presently, there are a lot of environmental threats that affect our lives. For example, air pollution is a significant problem that has severe effects on humans because the fumes emitted from cars can cause  lung disease. On top of that, engineering issue also plays an important role in our lives.

        "essay": "It is undoubtedly the case that huge number of cars is moving in the highways and this is causing problems for many communities. There are several reasons for this problem and various measures can be taken by both induviduals and governments to imrove this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two main factors that have led to the rise in traffic in towns and cities. One of the major causes is that the ownership of cars have been increasing in many societies, which means the vehicles become more affordable for the average people and they are no longer a luxury item, but something that most families expect to own. The second reason is that public transport has become increasingly unreliable and uncomfortable because many bus and train services are often delayed and not frequent. As a result, there has been a rise in the use of private cars, leading to the high volume of traffic, especially in rush hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the obvious reasons above,there are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems.Firstly, a simple solution would be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take the bus or the train rather than driving their own car. The second measure would be for governments to discourage people from driving to work by imposing special tariffs on using the roads, especially during peak periods. A successful example of this is the congestion fee in London which has certainly reduced the level of traffic in the city centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite some obvious reasons, various measures can be taken to tackle the problem of rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not be possible to find a complete solution, any action should probably involve encouraging greater use of public transport and making it more expensive for people to drive in urban areas.",

        "essay": "The continuous burning of fossil fuels is the major contributor to the environmental problem plaguing mother earth over the last decade. Society feels that the best way to tackle this problem is to increase the cost of fuel. However, I feel that is not the only way to relieve this planet of this problem. I will substantiate my reasoning in the course of this essay.\r\n\r\n\tFirst and foremost, increasing fuel costs will create a change in the transportation sector. Many people will choose to take alternate mediums of transport. They will be encouraged to carpool, use public transport and even in the case of short-distance travel, walk or use a bicycle. However, there is still no guarantee for this. For example, in my hometown Trivandrum, the price is currently INR. 104/- per litre, and keeps rising every week. Considering, that travel by car and bike is the easiest mode of transportation because of the distance between the different requirements in the city, and the lack of a reliable public transport system, individuals are still forced to rely on their cars to move from place to place.\r\n\r\n\tAlternately, what the government needs to do, is to strengthen the public transport sectors, impose heavy fines on the number of vehicles a family can posse, and in addition, they must thrust onto the public fines for using vehicles after a certain hour. Furthermore, they should encourage local bicycle businesses, by creating more bicycle lanes and parks, which will in turn help to boost their business. Car manufacturers, must look into the possibility of producing greener cars, and slowly phase out the production of petrol and diesel vehicles. Once this happens, more and more petrol stations will cater to the new requirements by vehicle owners. These are some of the changes that the administration can enforce.\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, I believe the increase in fuel price is not the only answer for this problem, but in fact, the government has to invest heavily in renewable forms of energy if any sustainable and lasting change needs to be made.",

As a primary illustration, sitting in front of computers and electronic devices for a long time can lead to boredom, physical problems, and being easily distracted by the surrounding environment, while, in school or university, their students’ own discipline prevents distraction, neglect students . Furthermore, communications keep in touch with the other students,  and tutorsteachers, communications gradually vanished . \r\n\r\nIn spite of some drawbacks mentioned beforeabove, using online courses has several benefits.

There could be various reasons which they want to attain before having an offspring, such as career goals and financial stability. In my view, there are more advantages to this approach. In my essay I will discuss both the views. \r\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages when the people decide to have an adolescent at a later stage, could be the medical issues. As we are aware that our human body has a certain way of responding, it is very likely that after a stage it is difficult for a woman to get pregnant. Hence, this could dishearten the couple when they decide to conceive a child at a later period of life.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are various advantages due to, which a couple decides to prolong his parenthood. One the advantages could be, having the financial stability. As the expenses of having a child is extremely high, and it cannot be managed if the person does not have the financial ability. For example, In my country the average age of marriage is round 27-28 years. At this age of life, it is very unlikely that the individuals would be financially very sound. Hence this could a reason they defer having the child for a later stage in life. In addition, the individuals are also not very mature to handle all the pressure that can a raise from having a child.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the more days the individual are very career oriented. The generation of today is highly competitive and most of them have a goal they are striving to achieve. This is one of the reasons that parenthood takes a back seat. People prioritise their work and career, most of them are in a view that being a parent could shift their focus. For example, in the recent survey, the rate of single people has increased significantly. Hence, it is very clear people have set priorities which defer to the past generation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is important to have the maturity and financial stability when two individuals plan to enter parenthood, as it comes with huge responsibilities and expenses.

        "essay": "Nowadays, some people assume that occupations might be substituted progressively by artificial robots in the future. In my opinion, although a majority of simple jobs will be done by machines ultimately, it is impossible that positions that require human relations can be replaced. This essay will discuss the reasons why only particular tasks will be finally taken over.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, artificial intelligence will easily overtake jobs that do not require specific and complex human skills in the workforce. From a cost point of view, many companies will choose to use robots because it is far less expensive than training and employing a human. Cashiers in supermarkets, for instance, are gradually being replaced by checkout machines that cost far less than employees. Customers can easily pay for their goods by using self-checkout facilities rather than standing in a long queue to wait for services at a counter. For these reasons, using advanced technology can be a significantly effective way for companies. \r\n\r\nConversely, there are some complicated human tasks that will never be overtaken by artificial intelligence because robots do not have the capacity to accomplish. In other words, some particular occupations require complex and critical thinking that only the human brain can implement. For example, science-related careers, such as doctors, scientists, pharmacists, and engineers, can only be carried out by professionals, even in the future. Therefore, Machines will not be able to sort out all of the problems which need to be overcome by humans. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, with the development of advanced artificial technology, it is no doubt that robots have the ability to replace a significant number of occupations in the near future. Unskilled labour will eventually be done by machines entirely; however, some sophisticated fields that require specific and complicated human skills will always exist. Consequently, jobs in particular professional areas will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent world.",

        "essay": "Driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, the use of robot technology has been widely spread on many occasions. While advocates believe that it marks social progress and will gain popularity in future, others are concerned that this kind of machine may make human-beings get into terrible trouble. From my perspective, it brings more good than harm.\r\n\r\nAutomation in manufacturing can significantly increase efficiency and improve productivity. The amount of work an automatic machine can finish in a day is perhaps 100 times as much as a person’s workload. Arduous and repetitive work ranging from the transportation of goods to the operation of assembly can be done automatically, so humans have more time to do creative work and enjoy leisure activities. In addition, the application of robotics can reduce workers' exposure to various hazards that cause damage to health or pose a risk of injury or death. For instance, in case of a gas blast, robotic counterparts can be sent to the scene of the explosion to carry out dangerous tasks.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt that robots may have the potential to generate negative impacts on us. For one thing, it may cause rising unemployment because manpower will be replaced by automatic machines in the workplace, which are not only cost-effective but require nothing but energy. This may upend industrialisation as a whole, widening the gap between the rich and poor. Another concern is that someday robotic machines might equip themselves with high intelligence, thus ruling the world and enslaving humans. However, robots will be unable to become the ruler on Earth just as what some sci-fi movies portray, because have no soul, meaning that the lack of creation and critical thinking restrain them from taking charge of the world. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, pressured by the shortage of manual labour and propelled by technological development, robots will play a crucial role in the future, which, although they may pose multifaceted risks to our society, should not obscure the benefits of automation.",

        "prompt": "In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?",
        "essay": "In several countries nowadays, there is an increasing number of people who are concerned and believe that the past of their homes is worth knowing. Every person has personal and different reasons and has various ways to obtain information about the history of their abode.\r\n\r\nFirstly, one of the considerations as to why individuals desire to know about the past story of a property before buying is personal reasons. A person who bought a house might be a superstitious one who believes in paranormal activities which could influence the way he or she treats the asset because of this belief. Prior to occupation, there might be some rituals to perform in order to cast out the negativity that might have been caused by previous occurrences.  For example, in the US, there are several houses considered haunted because of unsolved crimes that happened in the past, the most common of these are in the countryside where there is an opportunity for evil-minded people to do such acts. So, for some individuals, it is paramount that every property acquired does not have a gruesome past. \r\n\r\nFurther, there are several means to gather information regarding the house that is about to purchase. Among the basic details that need to obtain is the primary and succeeding owner of the house, how old and if there is any untoward incident happened for the previous owners of the asset. Also, it is important to know the reasons why the owner wants to sell it, there might have been a significant reason for it. For example, a politician sells his house because he wants to go abroad and decided to resign from his post according to him, but on the contrary, he wants to evade a possible investigation because of irregularities in obtaining it. Due to some other reasons that an asset is being sold, a buyer should seek facts before the acquisition.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is important to inquire about relevant information before buying a property especially for the place people called home. There might be unpleasant experiences that might have happened in the past that will haunt the occupants if not properly considered.",

In my, opinion both propositions appear to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate on my views on the positive and negative impacts of the trends and thus will read to a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nto begin with, the first argument of the essay,  some leaders are born with the natural skills they just need to identify develop and nurture them in addition, they have unique traits that make them different from ordinary folks and they lead from fronts. to exemplify there is a list of copious people in Pakistan who have captaincy ideologies and proven records in their field of experience or major such as Cricket sports person and iconic personality Shahid Khan Afridi has the leadership quality since childhood and he has always led from the front and he won the numerous matches owing to his planning and natural skills on the ground that make him champions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, toward the second argument of the debate, some folks are talented too they just need attention, ample time, and professional headship to develop it and it can be developed at any phase of life. as a result, they can be able to lead according to their abilities. for instance, I heard a plethora of stories in my surroundings and international level regarding heroes and businessmen who were not competent and deprived of traits but succeeded in their life. e.g A successful businessman in Pakistan Malik Riyaz who are not well-educated nor inborn talented but they have qualities and traits that make him up to mark or remarkable position owing to his leadership skill because leader leads them from the front and take risks.\r\n\r\nfinally, to wrap up according to the aforementioned arguments reach a conclusion that undoubtedly, some people are born with natural talents and mindsets that make the most famous and unique but some can develop these skills through struggle devotion, and utmost attention with the passage of time.",

In this eassy, I will discuss both views and I personally believe that robotics is the positive sign for this developing world.\r\n\r\nOn the first hand, there are some neagtive questions by handful individuls about automation. In this present world, job plays a vital role for become a bread winner and run smooth life, so dependancy on artificial intelligence can become the huddle for the job seekers. To illustrate, companies will start installing more automation instead of hiring indiviiduls for any job in the manufacturing plants that pratice will directly impact to job seekers. The another major negative impact of artificial intelligence development would be human's health. Preciecly, by developing the automation, people will start relying on robotics and they will start avoiding daily physical activities which is not beneficial for their health. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, technological advancement is a positive tend of economical growth for any nation. By setting-up more auto machines in industries can bring the financial growth in the terms of production and effeciency.  For example, recently a American company has seen drastic changes in their production units by installing automation in their manufacturing plant. This practice also benefical for companies and individuls for risky jobs, there are lot of jobs which have life risks for workers, therefore robots are the best alternation for completing such kind of jobs ( installing and cleaning windows of skyscrapers).

        "essay": "Many people have expressed that a number of reports detailing crime news should be controlled, as they have many negative effects on society. I partly agree with this view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I believe the bad influences that stem from two main reasons. Firstly, the direct result of crime news with extremely details are to bring victims psychological injury. To pique readers’ interest, the media may use the bloody images and exaggerated language. This reminds me of a school murder that occurred in China.The local media had numerous reports on the atrocious detail of crimes. Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate. It not only to victim's mental health caused some damage, but also to the whole community to bring about a great potential threat. So the media should not report too many details of crimes to the public. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the crime news can serve as a public warning. People can enhance their guarding consciousness in order to avoid becoming a victim, and also  assist the police in remaining alert. For example, the media report criminal news in a public place to arouse our social concern. The police can use this information to strengthen the force of supervision in this areas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I argue that detail of crimes in the media are likely to invite various problems, and we should limit them to protect people from harm.",

        "essay": "It is the social responsibility of every business to work towards the improvement of quality of life of its workforce and society. Earning profits should not be the only motive of any organization. I completely agree with the given statement.\r\n\r\nFirstly, every organisation work towards a common goal of earning income. They work towards the goal of increasing their stakeholder’ networth. Stakeholders are the people who have some interests in the trade. It defines as all people including shareholders, creditors, debtors, and many more. All these people are interested in the trade and look for the higher returns on their investments from the company. For instance, if I would invest in the shares of any company, I would expect the rise in the value of my shares. Secondly, The companies which focus merely on the money do not earn a good reputation in the eyes of the community. Finally, companies who have a good reputation in the eyes of their group or community can survive in the long run.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Indian government has also imposed mandatory guidelines related to the corporate social responsibility to every organisation. Additionally, it is the duty of every business to show the transparency and accountability towards the people interested in the trade by presenting correct financial status. For example, in the past, there have been many scandals, which caused harm to the economy. To fix the loopholes in the laws, many amendments have been introduced and authorities work stringently towards following those rules.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I would say that every business is accountable for its society. The sole purpose of companies should not be earning profits only.",

        "essay": "Children’s development is very essential. It can decide whether children will grow up to be a better people or not. Many people think outdoor activities are more useful for children’s development compared with playing computer games. For me, I strongly agree with this view and wil give my reasons in the essay below.\r\nThe main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing\r\nAnother reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight. As it can be, children will have a good physical health form outdoor activities.\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that adults should support their child with outdoor activities for the purpose of socializing and good physical health.",

        "essay": "There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.\r\nTo begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.\r\nApart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.\r\nIn light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.",

        "essay": "Years ago people thought about robots just as futuristic movies . Nowadays, some people think that robots will replace all types of tasks. Although robots can  replace human careers, there are assignments that request human contact  that robots won’t be able to substitute.\r\n\r\n Robots are machines that could be  expensive initially,  but after a while, it  turns cheaper than paying  human beings.  For instance, robots just request  maintenance every specific time,and these are more efficient because they  are created to do one specific skill,and they do not need to have breaks or benefits  like humans. For these reasons, I think robots will take some labour and human profession.\r\n\r\nConversely,  there are some tasks that are irreplaceable for robots namely,x medicine, education, and social work. These types of professions  require a human touch. For ,instance personally I would  not like to have doctor appointments without a physical examination or going to the psychologist and talking with a machine. Robots  will not replace  these types of human work that require  physical contact.\r\n\r\n To conclude,  there is a significant operation that  can  be replaced by robots  to become  efficient and productive.

If a person grows up in a house, this place becomes a shelter, a sweet memory, somewhere with familiar faces. It triggers the kids to make experiments on the strange places of the house and this experiments turn to passion to search about some facts such as who lived in this place before, which architect has built this area, which historical states  this region had belonged to etc. \r\n\r\nArchives, libraries, collection of old newspapers, and especially internet today link  us easily to information about the past of the places we live in.

        "essay": "Nowadays, there are mixed opinions about climate change. A faction of people think that we should embrace it, and find a way to adjust alongside it. Throughout this essay, I will explain my disagreement with this viewpoint. Firstly, I will discuss the growing effects of global warming on species, and secondly, I will shed light on the long term impact of this phenomenon. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, global temperatures are on the rise since the last few decades. As a result of this, the polar glaciers are melting at a faster rate; thereby, contributing to an increase in the water levels of the oceans. If necessary actions aren't taken on a priority basis, there maybe a higher risk of losing land to water. For instance, a survey by National Geographic showed that on an average land is getting reduced by 1 cm each year. Consequently, the species will be in a dire situation as a result of this. Second of all, the rising heat levels have also resulted in the the habitat loss of many animals. Polar bears and penguins are finding it difficult in adjusting to the drastic changes surrounding their natural habitat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the future generations will have a tough time coping up with the damages resulting from the climate change. Firstly, it is predicated that the global population is on the rise and will reach the 15 billion mark by 2050. However, there will be much less land available to inhabitat as most of it will be submerged under water. Secondly, one of the major contributors to the temperature change is rising pollution levels. If the pollution levels aren't kept under check, the future diaspora will find it hard to survive on this planet and lead a healthy lifestyle. Along with that, all the natural resources resources will go extinct, and there will be nothing left for their usage. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, climate change is a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.

        "essay": "These days, because of a highly competitive commercial market, people are bombarded with an array of advertisements in various types of media. Numerous adverse impacts of this trend have arisen on buyers, and governments can take steps to mitigate these problems.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why the ubiquity of advertisements can leave several repercussions for customers. To begin with, individuals' choice of products might be manipulated if they heavily rely on commercials. Marketers tend to employ tricks and gimmicks or exaggerate the quality of their products to lure people into purchasing products that they have no real need for or can be of poor quality and different from what the advertisement had shown before, leading to great dissatisfaction among buyers. Additionally, due to the high cost, advertisements increase the price of products. For example, it is costly to have a commercial broadcast on television. Therefore, consumers would have to pay more money for the same items.\r\n\r\nIn order to tackle these issues, a number of viable solutions could be implemented by authorities. Firstly, they should impose strict regulations on the advertising industry, like exercising censorship on all advertisements. A rigorous content check must be carried out prior to publishing a commercial to ensure the description of a product accurately reflects its actual quality. In addition, there should be a limit on the number of platforms on which advertisements are permitted to occur, such as billboards, posters, televisions, or social media. This would effectively safeguard consumers against information overload and help them avoid making wasteful purchases. Finally, several consumer awareness projects can be made to ensure the buyers are informed of the goods, services, and consumer rights.As a result, they can make the right choices when buying something.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undoubtedly clear that citizens are easily lured into purchasing unnecessary products if they watch too many advertisements; this issue can still be addressed by appropriate measures from the administrations.",

In my opinion, learning art is crucial as it is a source of connection with our ancestors and should be taught to some extent to the kids.\r\n\r\nArt is a source of connection between or present and past, it must be taught to our future generation to keep them connected with our past. This means that even though art subjects seem unnecessary, these remind us of our culture and our past generations which are crucial to staying attached to our societal norms. For instance, the traditional warfares, clothing and source of entertainments such as music and theatre are the sources from where we learn the way of living of our ancestors and learn lessons to built our future as well. Therefore, these subjects must be taught to  youngsters.\r\n\r\nIn contrary, the advocates of eliminating this subjects from school curriculum say that science and technology need to be our focal point nowadays because we would have to seek our future career in it. Which means to say that, unlike arts subjects, science and advanced subjects have more to offer in career perspective. For example, a science student has more probability get a highly paid job in the future, while one of the liberal arts does not have such prospects. Hence,  art courses should be excluded from schools.    \r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  although some hold the opinion that learning art is important for the kids at school, others still consider it a waste of time.

        "essay": "In this day and age, human activities undoubtedly have detrimental impacts on organic life forms. While many people argue that any solution to tackle this dire problem is too late, others believe that the situation can still be improved by taking effective measures. In the following essay, I am going to discuss both sides of the argument and state my opinion. \r\n\r\nMany individuals think that any effort to solve the irreversible damage of human civilization on nature is overdue. This is due to the fact that this issue has lasted for several decades without any effective intervention. Simply put, over the course of history, civilizations have driven a large number of plants and animals to the verge of extinction for a host of reasons, whether to satisfy our personal gains such as collections or deforestation, or false rumours. For instance, during the past decade, a fabrication stating that rhino horns can cure almost every disease known to man, caused poachers to hunt down rhinos to collect their horns, meanwhile collectors would pay a fortune to gain access to these rumoured magical cures. Consequently, the number of rhinos drastically decreases, and despite any effort to preserve this endangered species, rhinos die out owing to the fact that the remaining specimens cannot mate and reproduce. Moreover, humans also cut down forests to make room for agriculture and construction sites, causing numerous species to lose their natural habitats. These are only a few examples of the harmful impacts of human activities on nature. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many solutions can be utilized to improve the situation. First of all, technology has been innovated in our time, and many of these innovations have the potential to enhance the natural habitats of plants and animals. In today’s world, scientists have developed numerous ways to protect and preserve, as well as replicate endangered species in laboratories and provide necessities for their growth after releasing them into the wild. For example, an extinct herb has been recreated and nurtured in an ideal atmosphere, and researchers would take special care to guarantee its flourishment after planting them on suitable grounds. Furthermore, nowadays awareness of society about the detrimental effects of human civilizations on natural life has been raised, so people are increasingly concerned with conserving organic living forms. Taking bears as an example, people in Vietnam used to hunt and kill bears to extract bear gall, however, this practice has gradually been alabeloned thanks to the education of the government. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reason that leads individuals to believe that any measure to deal with the negative effects of humans on nature is overdue is that it has lasted for too long. Nevertheless, several methods can be taken into account to solve this situation, such as the application of technological innovations in conserving wildlife. From my point of view, human effects on wildlife can be reversed using technologies and raising social awareness about biodiversity.",

        "prompt": "More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?",
        "essay": "Nowadays, more and more couples have a plan to give birth in their older age than in the previous generations. This happens because of some certain reasons and I believe that this trend brings more drawbacks than benefits.\r\nThere are some causes that contribute to the decision of having children in old age of parents. The first reason is related to freedom. Bringing up a child would take a large amount of time of married couples, this results in the lack of free time for themselves to do what they like. For example, those who have a hobby of travelling will feel comfortable and carefree when taking trips to their favorite destinations without worrying about taking after of a child. Another reason is that high cost of living. The increase in prices of goods make parents find more difficult to raise a child nowadays than in the past, therefore they want to have an abundant source of finance before giving birth by spending most of their time in their young age to work and having children in their old age. \r\nOn the one hand, having children late will affect negatively to mothers’ health and babies’ as well. Giving birth at an old age results in disorders and innate malformations in newborn babies and even take mothers’ life. Another disadvantage is the negative effect to the economic development. This is because the growth of old population leads to the shortage of young labor workforce. Thus, the economy has to rely on mainly older workers, from that economic performance and productivity are low. On the other hand, delivering a baby in the old age also bring advantages. Parents have more time to work and earn money in their young age, hence they can secure a better life for their children in the future. For instant, my aunt spent most of her young time to run her own company and decided to have a child at her 35. Now, she had a lucrative income from the operation of her company and her daughter is sent to one of the prestigious international school in HN. \r\nIn conclusion, there are various factors leading to have babies in the old age of couples. I argue that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.",

        "prompt": "Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?",
        "essay": "Nowadays, to serve a billion people each day we need a huge of food and sometimes people can consume it. In the following essay, I discuss some of reason why people do it and how to solve that problem. \r\n\r\nThere are a hundred of reasons why a large amount of food is wasted every year. First, since most fresh foods, such as meat and vegetables, are perishable, they usually have expired or best before dates. This means that if people do not consume them quickly enough, \r\n\r\nfoods will be expired and no longer to use, which results in food waste.\r\n\r\nSecond, the way humans prepare foods also contributes to food waste. \r\n\r\nFor example, if foods are badly prepared, either at home or in the restaurant, people will confuse to eat and food waste will often occur as a result. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are also a variety of solutions to improve this trend. \r\n\r\nFirst, even if some foods are not use for humans, they can be composted or used to feed livestock or animals. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry but also help reduce land filled organic matter that can be damaging to the environment. \r\n\r\nSecond, even if the food waste is not use for livestock, it can still be used as a material to produce renewable energy. For example, in Singapore and some develop nations have taken steps to turn organic matter from food waste into biogas, generating electrical power at very low costs. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though food waste seems not harmless in today’s world, there are various ways to recycle it. Feeding livestock and generate energy can be two of the most useful ways to tackle food waste.",

This essay intends to discuss  both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children. Firstly, children have a hectic schedule, they spend the most time in  school and later they have to do homework which had given by their teachers then spend some time on tv by watching their favourite show gives them relaxation from the study. Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge. Finally, some children decide their career by watching sports, food, music, and arts from the tv program. For instance, most sportspeople choose sports by watching their favourite games. Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.\r\n\r\nOther individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak. Further, many violent and vulgar shows are broadcast on tv, which affects them mentally due to this they develop some bad habits at an early age, later this becomes a great problem in their life.\r\n\r\nI believe that watching tv has an advantage for  toddlers. They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves. Whereas, it is one of the greatest things to kill boredom in life.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, \"every coin has two sides.\" Parents should limit the time of watching television and watch tv with them so that they could not watch some aggressive shows.",

        "essay": "Opinions differ when it comes to whether or not news influences people's lives. While some people think reading the newspapers and watching television are time-consuming, I contend that news plays an instrumental role in today's world.\r\nAdmittedly, a large part of news has a futile effect on people's lives. Individuals are likely to be bombarded with a plethora of news over the world, ranging from sports to environment or science. Such news may not happen around them and indirectly influence people and their relatives. For example, the presidential election in the US is irrelevant to farmers in VietNam. People find it unnecessary to know who wins the presidential election in a foreign country. In the same way, news about calamities such as drought or flood in Africa has little to do with the citizenry in Vietnam.\r\nDespite the valid argument mentioned above, I believe that news has several benefits to people's lives in many ways. The core of this argument is that news help readers gain greater control over our lives to make informed decisions. Take the covid19 pandemic as an example. News can provide a realtime update about the number of confirmed cases and preventative measures. By the way, such news reminds people constantly to wear a mask in the crowd, maintain a safe distance from anyone and other methods to ameliorate the risk of infection. One more example is that news about global warming and climate change tends to adjust people's behavior. After reading news, individuals may realize how serious would be if they do not change their lifestyle to safeguard the environment. As a result, people would eschew eating meat, avoid using disposable products, and use public transport to reduce the personal carbon footprint.\r\nIn conclusion, although a majority of news is not linked in part with people's lives, I believe that news has a positive impact on our life for various reasons.",

Personally, I completely disagree with this view.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, news plays an important role in people's lives. It is true that people have a high demand for information about their daily basis these days. Therefore, news can be used to satisfy people's demands because it contains a myriad of details, which can be beneficial for them. For example, those, who are interested in business, often have the tendency of reading economic news in order to broaden their horizons about this field. In other words, human interest in various fields will always be the glue that links news with people's likes no matter what.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that  newspaper and television news programs are the most convenient and reliable sources for people to examine.Despite the proliferation of news recently, people should only lay their trust in mainstream sources, such as newspapers and television programs with a view to avoiding fake news that can have an adverse effect on people's lives. For instance, weather forecasts and political news can be seen so much on social platforms thanks to the development of technology, but some of these can be unreliable and wrong. As a result, people are likely to have a false belief about these details.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that news is an irreplaceable part of our daily basis.

It is clear to me that the more money the bussiness makes the more responsibilities to the society it should contribute to. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is absolutely no deny that businesses play a very important role in creating jobs for man. For example, Vinamilk is one of the largest food producers in Vietnam. They currently employ around 10 000 workers throughout Vietnam, according to their annual report. We can imagine that what might be happening if this giant company bankcrupt? Thousands of workers will be potentially loosing their job. This might impact markedly in the social balancing and the social sercurity as unemployment will rise up.\r\n\r\nSecondly, large organizations are capable to use their manpower to provide social facilities in a bigger scale. For instance, during the last two years of Covid, Vingroup,in accompanied with Chairman Mr. Vuong and his wife had been donated nearly 9000 billions VND to help our government and Vietnamese people to fight with the coronavirus. This unbelievable distribution help to save many people lives and children. Without this generous co-operation and these individuals, it is hard for our government to do such things fastly and precisely as they was shown to the public in the last period of time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, universal is operated in a circle. As it is written in one of favourite quote that “the more you give out, the more you get back”. The more the bussiness contribute back to people, to the society, to help them to archive the desirable goals, the more successful the bussiness can get as it will be paid back by people who were helped by them.

        "essay": "In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.\r\nThe first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.\r\nConsequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.\r\nTo sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.",

As far as I am concerned, I tend to believe this method definitely can benefit the whole society while potential negative influences bring about by this can not be ignored. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is obvious that increasing the cost of fuel and all vehicles can resolve the issue of environmental preservation to some extent. Firstly, with the increasing price of fuel, working people who usually drive private cars to commute between workplaces and home will be more likely to take public transport alternately. Therefore, the exhaust gas released by private cars will be reduced, which somehow is a way to respond to air pollution issue. Secondly, the adjustment of car prices will potentially influence individuals' determination on purchasing a car. If they figure out the price of owning a car and additional expense is much more expensive than taking public transport, they would more likely to choose public transport such as trams, and buses, in order to avoid additional expenditure. And as a result, fewer cars running on roads means less exhaust air release.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the disadvantages of increasing fuel costs and vehicles price cannot be ignored. The main reason for this view is that this kind of method will potentially lead people who regarded private cars as a must to experience financial burden, especially for those working individuals who live far away from workplaces and earn low income, as their disposable income is limited. Another reason for this view is that it is a fact that people who owned cars already will still choose to commute by car if the adjusted fuel price is still affordable. As they have already gotten used to commuting by car and insist on it, and as a result, it does not make any difference to this group of people\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I tend to believe this method is a feasible solution in response to air pollution. However,  some people will disadvantage from it and other appropriate methods such as subsidising people to take public transport and hybrid cars users would probably be an alternative in responding to this topic.",

        "essay": "Some people argue that technology makes the space between poor and rich people wider, while others say that it is actually helping them to be almost at the same level. This essay will discuss these views and  will provide my personal opinion of it. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, rich people can easily get access to the current technology  compared with poor people. Usually, the latest technology is likely to be expensive and  be only acquired by those who can pay for it.  For example, rich people can afford to buy an expensive computer, which might allow them to have more opportunities either in employment or educational field, whereas poor people might have to work for several years before being able to buy a computer and then get more opportunities. This trend, benefit more often the rich people and leave poor people behind, which in other words creates a gap \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, today, there are more  opportunities available for poor people that could avoid this gap. Several governments around the world are placing many strategies in their social development scheme in order to provide a range of technology for poor people.  For example, because of technology, now,it is possible to install solar panel technology in the most vulnerable regions, which allow poor people to save money. In addition, because of the internet technology, some people with low income can work and study from home in the countryside and rural areas. It allows them to overcome economical hardship and to avoid the gap between them and rich people.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, from my perspective, although there is more technology available for rich people,  technology is also helping poor people significantly.

        "essay": "When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, i would argue that it is better to go college or university\r\n  The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, learning skills which are necessary for your future career such as team working,problems solving,etc could be a good chance to be well-prepared and get a well-paid job. For example, applicants who have a real experiences which are only gained from working will be more impressive with employer in interviews. Secondly, it is undeniable that start earning money when you work straight after high school could help you to become independent with financial problems in future. For instance, the income that you accumulate every year from your job might increase to a numerous money if you make a good plan and the result is you could be comfortable in your spending. \r\n        On the other hand, i believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Furthemore, the job market in recent years is very competitive and academic qualifications are a good way to help you become prominent. As an illustration, some diplomas that you gain from higer level education such as master, doctor, etc are the compulsory codition to get a job in many speicial organizations like Ministry of Finance, Central Bank. What is more, knowledge which you obtain from university or college are the optimal way to broaden your horizon.

This essay will discuss one of the environmental pollution issues associated with the production and suggest viable solutions, before coming to a reasoned conclusion. \r\nAs life develops every day, due to the living standards of people raises, the demand for goods also requires more. The number of goods is mainly produced by machines, and output a much larger volume than 30 years ago. Consequently, waste from manufactories releases CO2 emission which causes environmental pollution and as a result leads to climate change and catastrophic natural disasters. For instance: Today, In the developing countries, because the need for transportation is high and owning vehicles such as motorbikes and cars too easy, level pollution of those countries is always in alarm condition. In addition, the damaging of the environment not only from the companies, but also from unconscious individuals.\r\nAlthough high consumption of goods will help the economy to develop, environmental issues need to be addressed.

Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language.

I reckon we should not glean a public's daily news from the press, TV, broadcast, and other media. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, it got proved that affluent people and wealthy politicians give a bribe to media and TV channels to deceive the population for various reasons. If one of the parliament members offends some major crimes, he or she can conceal the offence by using the power of media deluding people, which is a classical way how the press earns. There are countless incidences relating to this in Mongolia.

Hence, it is crucial to do not believe news reported by media.\r\n\r\nSecondly, insofar as the objective of the press and webs is to captivate as many readers as possible so that they can make more money. Many websites are posting many numbers of intriguing news, gossips, and other juicy info through the internet and social media every day.

Some people assert that going to study at a university or college is the best way to start building a career, whereas many others argue that the best way is to get a job straight after school. I will explore both arguments and give my opinion.\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n             Convincing arguments can be made that studying at a university is the best way to start a career. Firstly, and most importantly, learning in a group of other students while being taught by an experienced teacher is way easier than learning on your own. For example you can share different ideas with the other students which helps you considerably to learn faster and easier. Learning from others' mistakes rather than from your own is more comfortable. It is also important to note that the connections you build in your university or college will be beneficial in your career.\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n           In contrast, some others may claim that getting a job right after school is a better way to kick start your career. Firstly and most importantly, you can start right away working towards your dreams while others spend several years studying. Those several years can be crucial, and you might find yourself in a very good position in your career already while others are still studying at a college or university. Secondly, it is also possible to learn the important skills that you get taught in a university on your own in a process of doing. While working and perhaps starting a business you will make mistakes and you will learn from your own mistakes while getting valuable working experience.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n                Having considered both views, I think the best decision would be to balance the two.

This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be undertaken manually. \r\n\r\nRobots may be replaced to carry forward the jobs that are not too complex and can easily perform without much involvement by humans.As it will be beneficial for multinational companies and industries to gain profits through artificial intellect instead of spending highly on hiring, training and employing the human. For instance, in may metropolitan cities the traffic personnel are replaced by an automatic traffic control system which is far more cost effective. In addition, this system works around the clock and require no holiday.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons computers and robots will be involved in human lives more frequently in the upcoming future.\r\n\r\nConversely, there are some skillfull jobs that are interdependent on human relations and emotions, and that this job cannot be handled by automated robots.

In my opinion, both sides have positives and negatives, but the amount of time they spend  watching something matters the most. In this essay, both views and the reason for my opinion will be discussed. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people think that what children watch on television is what influences their offspring. For instance, when kids watch violent movies, they tend to mimic the things they saw and as a result, it can have an immense impact on their attitude. However, it is a well-known fact that children learn from events that happen over and over again. In other words, they need to see a behaviour constantly so they could mimic it. Thus, it seems like the subject of what youngsters see is not as influential as some might think. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others say that if children watch telly for a long time, then their attitudes start to change. To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that if offsprings watch the same traits on TV over and over again, then they start to mimic them. Moreover, scholars believe that when kids keep seeing the same attitude, the structure of their neural network will start to change. This shows that changes in youngsters' attitudes need time. Therefore, the amount of time that kids spend watching television is more important and it has more effects on kids' behaviour. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, some reckon that what children watch can change their behaviour and others think that the amount of time spent watching television is influencing them.

They states, these skills can be develoved by parents as well as by friends of that student. From my perspective, I strongly believe that this statement is correct, but I will be explaining both points of view with the support of some relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, school should focus mainly on the studies of the students. Providing them better educaction, that is the main obejective that the parents send their children to schools. This help them to get better remarks in the examinations, which help them to improve their academic background. In addition to this, student with some excellent academic record may receive some better job opportunities in futur as compared to the other people. For an instance, there are many countries with parents who want there children to be a doctor or an engineer, instead of chef or fashion designer. These kind of fields can only be achieved if the children focus more on their studies and examinations instead of some other activities. Even there are few guardians or parents who suggest that the school should provide sports activity instead of some extra curricular activities.\r\n\r\nIn contarst to this, students and their parents prefer that school should have some other skills aside from the subjects and examinations, such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork.

The first explanation is they can ensure their own safety while living in their own houses. It is possible to comprehend and develop a link with the past by investigating one’s ancestor or place of residence. Furthermore, there is a practical purpose for improving traditional construction methods to increase the safety of the box. For example, An older building is a good instance for this as it may use dangerous techniques or materials that may decay with time, posing a risk of structural damage and in the worst-case scenario, collapse. Residents can take the required precautions to ensure the home is structurally sound by studying about it and the time period when it was built.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the era of development in digital, there is no doubt that the media is one of the most powerful powers that people can find and search for essential information about the residence.

From my perspective, although in the future machines will have a huge impact on human life, there are many areas in that robots can not be considered as an alternative to human work. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people assert that in the next years, robots will be able to do most of the jobs in society and there won't be any opportunity for individuals. However, I strongly disagree with that statement. In fact, machines which work based on artificial intelligent are made by the human, as a result, they never have been able to do the jobs that need mental skills. For example, if a company face serious financial problems, only persons with skills like problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork will be able to solve them. \r\n\r\nThe second reason that we have to take into consideration is that the ways of communicating with other persons are a special ability of humans. Precisely, robots can not communicate with each other as well as with individuals. For instance, being a teacher needs to have many skills, but the foremost is that a teacher can make a strong bond with their students. Due to that, pupils will have convenient contact with their lecturers and it affects their learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I would like to conclude that the capacity of robots is limited and they never be able to do all kinds of careers which individuals do.

        "essay": "It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.\r\nThe main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.\r\nThis trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.\r\nIn summary, while science is regarded as a \"useless\" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.",

In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that individuals say that the best way to achieve goals in life is to graduate from a university is that numerous employers recruit employees according to the prestige of their universities. In other words, the ranking of the university that people graduated from is one of the factors that a lot of organizations consider when they recruit new workers. Moreover, the relationship among students at the college is useful for students when they find a job. To illustrate, graduates will be able to contact the alumni of their university who are working in the company that they want to apply, if they want some help with the application process.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why people think that earning a university education is longer significant for becoming successful is that there are many other methods that folk can learn the crucial skills for their jobs.

While, it is possible that most of the simple jobs will be replaced, it is highly unlikely to take over skilled jobs that require human contact- to be performed by robots. This essay will discuss why majority of the jobs will be carried out by robots.\r\nRobots may eventually replace largely number of human labour that doesn’t require sophisticated and complex human skills. They are cost-effective and significantly reduces the amount of money given that would otherwise be given to labourers. In addition, they are less time consuming as they are automatically programmed to carry out a particular task. In Dubai, for instance, all mega shopping malls use robotic cashiers thus, doing jobs without being paid heavily. Furthermore, it minimizes the human error that otherwise is impossible to be rectified. In Qatar, for example, all toll tax collections on motorways are done by robots, making it cost effective and less time consuming. For these reasons, robots will replace, by and large, most of the jobs in the near future.\r\nHowever, there are some human jobs that can’t be replaced by robots because they will never achieve the capacity to do them. Humans are complexly designed creation of God with unique ability to think, mold and modify according to the situations. Jobs, for instance, Psychology, Medicine, Education and Social work require higher Human intelligence that can’t be performed by artificially designed robots. Due to these reasons, robots will never be able to do jobs that need human skills and touch.\r\nTo sum up, it is highly possible that a considerable number of Occupations will be done by robots in near future. Unskillful and menial jobs will be done entirely by robots; however fine skillful jobs that require human hand will always exist.

I agree that the youngsters ought to spend free moments in social services voluntarily and freely.\r\n\tUnpaid communal works improve social relations among the people and the teenagers. The services provided for humanity earn kindness and respect from the humanity leading to strengthened relationships between the residents. People come more close in terms of understanding the hardships and requirements on one hand and happiness in the other hand. Consequently this cohesion keeps the masses connected thus avoiding loneliness and social issues. The benefits are for both the individual and public. Recently the Quaid e Azam University has made it compulsory for its students to work in social services for 1 month during summer vacations.\r\n\r\n\tFurthermore, community based honorary services produce skilled workers at an earlier stage. During social engagements teenagers are employed in different types of works thus getting early and in depth knowhow about different fields. Ultimately, they are ready to enter the practical life and ready to adopt it easily. In addition, with work experience, they are at advantage of getting jobs. Availability of skilled manpower eases the concerns of society which it would have faced had the manpower been deficient. Students of NUST with a field experience gained during the internship, are at an advantage in job priority.\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, community services which are done by young people without honorarium are fruitful regarding social relationships and employment and I support such works by the youth.",

        "essay": "A section of society believes that heads of multinational companies should be paid more handsome salaries than ordinary workers, while others opine that this is an unfair trend. This essay agrees with the formal view because directors of large organizations are well-educated and also they have more experience compared to regular employees.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, companies pay more salaries to their directors because these directors have high-quality experience and also they have more knowledge about a particular field. To say it, most of all companies hire those people as directors who have masters in a specific field and they need  experienced people. For example, The Chief Executive Officer of Google, Sundar Pichai, is a metallurgy engineer and earned Master's in Business Administration, in addition, he has around 30 years of experience in the administration field. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some groups say that in any organization, all employees should be treated in the same way because unfair behaviour creates conflicts between them. In other words, if all workers do not get similar pay, they feel disappointed and it affects the mental health of employees and they never do their best in their work. Sometimes they leave companies just because of not get handsome salaries. For instance, a survey conducted by Oxford University in London that around 87% of employees leave their job just because of not getting enough pay.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although uneven salaries create conflicts between employers and organizations, well-educated and more experienced employees are required by multinational companies and for that reason, directors of companies should be more paid than ordinary workers.",

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after shool, I believe that it is better to go to college or university. This essay, I will discuss that idea. \r\n\r\nLet’t start by looking of the advantages of start work straight. Firstly, young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In the way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford things which they love. For example, my young brother went to work as soon as he finished school, and he purchased a motorbike which loves. Secondly, they will be albe to approach to works sooner, and assist they in the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to the jobs which they have chosen. This may lead to promotions and a successfull career.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe there are many benefits of continuing to college or university. Fisrtly, academic qualifications will increase significantly compere to those who did not continue studies after finishing school. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with lower qualifications. In additionally, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, companies usually choose the applicants who graduate university than others.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, from the reasons above, even though going to work right after finishing school has many benefits, I personally believe that continuing to study will be much more beneficial.",

        "essay": "Every civilian should be Mahatma Gandhi to his society. There is no doubt that online education has become a new learning trend. However, while I agree that they also have negative aspects, still I believe that this advanced technology is mainly beneficial to  individuals. In this essay, I will  support my view with examples.\r\n\r\n During the coronavirus pandemic, offline schooling became more challenging. The universities had to start web-based classes, in order to stop coronavirus from affecting the younger generation's health. In initial studies, it was declared that this virus is more dangerous to the youth. In such a situation, it was difficult to continue the academic system without wasting kids studies and maintaining their health. At that time, virtual tuitions were only the possible option that can save school learner's years and well-being simultaneously. due to this solution, the youngsters can connect with their teachers and faculty. They can learn new concepts and clear their doubts. Moreover, they can even conduct digital examinations.\r\n\r\nAnother major advantage of attending  such courses is that it saves time. Nowadays, time plays a crucial role in our life. If a working person wants to pursue a specific program then it may become difficult for him to make a balance between his job and exams, as he also needs to travel to his university to attend the classes. As a consequence, it becomes hard to concentrate on both the tasks and he may lose his focus and leads to mental pressure. While applying for such alternatives, it can save his travelling time and he can also utilize his travelling  time in learning. In recent years, there are many applications are available in the market and with their ,help you can select your stream. One such example is the Upgrade application. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite there are few reasons why we should value offline education, I'm inclined to consider that the pros of online education outnumber the cons.",

        "essay": "Most people agree to the importance of experience in one's professional life. Unfortunately, many fresh university graduates cannot look for a job prospect in their profession. This sad reality can be due to many reasons. One of such could be more number of professionals than the actual demand of the prticular profession. Also, there are many streotypes associated with our society which doesnt led to the placement of all the graduates. As a community, we should understand this situation and make the necessarity amendment in the market and in our mindset. \r\n\r\nWe all have seen professions which are overcrowded in nature. For instance, many engineers are produced  in our country in a year from different institutions. What one has to wonder, do we really want so many of them? One should understand the role of demand before persuing any engineering degree. Also, there are many premium institutes which offer engineering. If one is going to persue it from them, the chances of getting placed would be naturally higher. For example, Indian Institute of Technology will definately make sure that they will place their graduate because of the quality of the institution. As a student, one should be open to new courses and understand the market before enrolling to engineering. We have also seen so many private universities offering engineering and we as students go for these without even considering the demand for it. You might never question will these private university degree will help you to compete with the market. \r\n\r\nOne cannot deny the fact that there are many streotypes associated in our society. These streotypes evidently often disturbs one's personal and professional life. We all have noticed streotypes in specific professions also. For instance, teachers are often women. Why? Nobody knows it. Chefs are mostly women. Why? A man in the world of technology is preferred more than a woman. These gender streotyping blocks our mind and often neglects the talent. I understand there is change happening in our society with regards to this but, this change has to be mushroomed. If we change such mindset, the market will open for many university graduates irrespective of their gender. \r\n\r\nIn short,the university graduates should be able to understand the market before getting admission to any institute. Also, it is imperative the understand the value of the institution. On the other hand, we can make these minor mindset shift within us which will open more employment opportunity for the university graduates in their preferred field.",

Therefore, a substantial proportion of individuals think that the only way to enhance welfare is to make inflexible rules and regulations because carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. I partially agree with the given statement. Well-being has several other alternative ways to counter this problem.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the administration can either make strict constitutions or punish because they cannot do both commodities. Videlicet, when they make laws to tackle road accidents, but it is extremely hard to follow natives. On the other hand, when the authorities are making inflexible punishment. They cannot improve the economy in the correct way. For example, more than two-fifths of natives are died every year due to the usage of smartphones while driving. The fatality rate has massively risen. Thus, governments should take some useful action as compared to make guidelines. It is extremely brutal for the population because it is a sudden stop.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the fact cannot be denied that several individuals are not well-educated. They do not have proper information regarding harmlessness. For instance, the department of education in the USA revealed that more than one-fifth of inhabitants are not educated, but they should consider or buy cars or bicycles even when it has the proper skill to drive a car. Nevertheless, they have less information regarding regulations. As a result, education is an essential part of an individual's life and leadership should give free coaching to control the mortality rate.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, unquestionably, when the authority makes strict laws or punishments natives cannot follow the right way. They need to provide higher and quality education to residents.",

        "essay": "Since the introduction of the internet, people have always debated opon whether the illegal usages of such technologies will outwiegh the advances it will bring forth. One of the main topics to talk about is the music industry. It is clear that no matter what is done unautorized usage of tracks can not be controlled, yet the question that remains is \"does it have a profound effect on the whole industry?\".\r\n\r\nFirstly, it should be noted that the phenomenon definetly has a negetive sum result. Some people stand behind the idea that such actions will hurt the music. The line of thought they have is, if an artist is making less money as a result of an individual not paying to buy the track, they will have less to produce the next one. This is true specially in the case of newcomers to the business. They are the ones at the highest risk since, they cannot make enough money to go on if similar actions go on.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can be said that while the negetive consiquences are clear, there is little that change they bring. This is the result of two main factors. The major one being, the consumer who uses such methods. As a recent internet analysis showed, most of the illigal downloaders are from the poorer countries ,who normally cannot efford to pay for songs. This translates to almost no income lost ,since the person who got the song through illigal means wouldn't have paid for it anyway. On another side of the issue, lies the publicity of the artist who will not have maid it if these smaller songs didn't go around so much. For instance, we can look at the case of Westghoust, a singer who made sure his songs could not be attain through such mesures. In the his carrier did not bloom as well as it should have, showing the fault in his way.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we have to pay attention to the unequal distribution of money and its effects on the music industry.In my opinion, it can easily be made clear ,that the little amount of money lost wouldn't have made a considerable impact on any artist.",

In other words, people nowadays have a hectic schedule and do not have enough time to for themselves, so in spite of repairing the broken things , they prefer to buy new products which save time and also repairing costs more than buying new ones. \r\n\r\nSecondly, people are getting attracted, to advertisements due to massive consumerism of the product. Furthermore, with the globalization people desire to have updated things and as a result ,old things are being thrown away or replaced. For example, a survey conducted by the University of Oxford found that 70% of people choosing new things over old ones after getting damaged as it saves time and feels to upgrade.\r\n\r\nDespite the benefits, it also has negative consequences on the environment, in order to fulfil the demands of  people, companies are exploiting natural resources.

While some believe that the costs of environmental and housing enhancement should be reduced to deal with such issues, I, however, disagree with the statement and believe that this development should not be deducted because of various reasons which will be elaborated on in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo embark on, environmental development brings numerous benefits to citizens in the country. This is not only about improving the environment  but also enhancing individuals’ well-being as it tends to decrease different pollution which could be stimulated into the human body that causes serious health problems. For example, reducing gas emissions from industrial businesses potentially lowers the causes of various diseases, cancer in particular.\r\n\r\nLikewise, encouraging the government to ignore housing problems introduces certain people to several unhealthy problems. In other words, due to the increasing number of homeless individuals, they receive a large amount of air pollution while living without habitats. Moreover, those may have terrible dietary habits, leading to some illnesses such as food poisoning and starvation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some people may opine that physical well-being is hindered by such environmental and housing development. In short, it is required to make a large expenditure for handling such problems, potentially causing the government’s financial burden, resulting in less budget to protect residents from unhealthy. Conversely, it is suggested to allocate the money to combat health problems instead. For instance, the government should invest in health research to advance the technology related to well-being. Additionally, they should subsidize healthcare expenses for citizens, especially for those who facing poverty issues.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some people may argue that the budget for environmental and residential issues should be allocated to handle healthcare sectors, I personally disagree with this solution and think that these developments are crucial for citizens.

In fact, not all charitable organizations have massive scale and abundant source of finance, therefore they cannot take care of both the poor people in their country and others being out of their national border at the same time. Secondly, it may be a pragmatic strategy for charity funds when they focus on providing aid to their residents because it allows their country to be less reliant on foreign subsidies in case of emergency. For example, there would be a beneficial effect on some countries which often suffer from natural disasters, such as Vietnamese, Philippine, Japan, etc. If their charities afford to rescue local people instead of expecting outside support.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been true in many cases that the prolonged poverty cannot be solved without the assistance from foreign humanitarian organizations. First, the product of poverty is the hunger, causing millions of deaths all around the world every year. As a result, if outside governments have steps for finance towards residents, who have been living in other countries,  which would save the lives of humans. Second, governmental organizations can help provide the education and skill for those citizens. As a result, plenty of evidence suggests that the most effective way to overcome poverty is education.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some think that domination systems must only support the poor dwellers, but I think other nations should receive assistance because of above-mentioned reasons, and this method can reduce the financial pressure of international organisations.",

        "essay": "I few countries, many people are interested to know about the past details of their home they are living in. It is because of curiosity and people can know about it from their old neighbours and the internet.\r\n\r\nWhen people going to buy a new house, as a normal human nature, they want to know why the previous owner wants to sell that house and is there any previous history in this house. Because there is a lot of house in the world where lots of different type of history belongs to it. Sometimes it has historical value and sometimes it has some moral value. For example, in Chicago USA, a buyer bought a house for their family to live in and when he try to find out the history of that house he found a great history about that house, that house was used as a camp in the world war 2. So it is really of great historical value.\r\n\r\nPeople can find about it in anyways, first they can know from the previous owner but sometimes the previous owner maybe does not know anything. So another way would be to ask old citizens in that area. Also if there have any historical or any special values then people can find them on the internet. For example, there are lots of information we can find on the internet about the house where different types of historical, horror and memorable stuff happened but the previous owner does not know about it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, because of historical value and memorable stuff in living ,home people are now becoming more interested to know about the previous history where they live in.

        "essay": "It has been opined by many individuals that pursuing higher education at varsities or colleges paves the way for building up a career filled with success while others say that it is better to start work straight after high school. In my opinion, getting a job after high school is a good idea but higher education is equally important because it will help students to gain in-depth knowledge of the subject they will be choosing after post-high school and getting the desired job in their requisite fields, earning handsome money.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, today’s market is competitive. Thousands of students are applying for different  jobs according to their requisite skills for  higher pay which is leading to a higher level of competition and it has become tougher for companies to choose between skill sets that could match their requirements. It is one of the main reasons why higher education is required. With a higher degree, like for instance, a master’s, the students will be learning new and fresh skills according to the corporate requirements and therefore they will be given first preference for good jobs with the capabilities of the students being tested in-depth and accordingly they will be getting the desired job with a higher remuneration along with good work-life balance in comparison to persons having lower degrees. In other words, they have to struggle less in the formation of their career. For instance, In India, most of the industries need students to have a post-graduation or a professional certification like a chartered accountancy, masters of technology completed to apply for higher scale jobs like an auditor, business analyst. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not bad to start working after high school. Many individuals start their career after higher secondary education to gain experience but do not like to go for higher degrees later. As a result, with no updated skills, it becomes difficult for them to find their desired job. Therefore, they have to take up whatever comes on their way without getting the option to choose between the jobs. On the other hand, whatever jobs they are taking up, their salary is comparatively less with minimum growth opportunities compared to higher degree holders and with a disturbing work-life balance. For instance, In India, most of the high school students land up with a call – centre job without getting enough opportunity to grow.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, although students start job after high school for relevant experience,  higher education is highly preferred to understand the market requirements and landing up with a suitable job they want.",

        "essay": "It is believed by some that trading activities between nations should not be restricted by the government. Although I understand that people are worried about the unfairness it may bring, I reckon sometimes government controls are essential and there is no other choice.\r\n\r\nPeople who agree with the statement support the free economy, which is a concept agreed upon by most countries nowadays, that there should not be any restriction by the authorities on the market. The trading activities are solely based on demand and supply, which would naturally lead to equilibrium. However, if the government put its hands in the market, people aware that it might cause unfairness because policies would never benefit or burden every stakeholder. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I believe some regulations on exports are necessary in some cases. If a country failed on a commitment between nations, sanctions could be an effective way of punishment. Take the carbon emission goals among some countries as an example, a country would be much more motivated to monitor industrial activities to meet the target if they will have to bear the severe economic losses brought by a sanction of goods. On top of that, government intervention in international trade is necessary to stabilize the currency value and local economy. The competition between America and China is a typical example. America had tried to ban various types of merchandise from China because the cheap products are overflowing into America, which caused a significant decrease in the value of the American dollar and unemployment in the society. There is no other way than national involvement to solve these problems. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, restrictions on exports of goods contradicted the idea of a free economy but it is inevitable in some situations when it comes to cooperation between different countries and when the trades between countries are imbalanced.",

        "essay": "Arguably, it is commented that entities  trading in a specific region should not only be focused on profiting. However,  they should  care for the local communities. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since  enterprises  have responsibilities to  develop neighbourhoods. Although this development is highly criticised by  managers. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand,  businesses are accountable for  the local  district  advancement. In other words,  once they  are exploring  raw materials, lands or other sorts of goods or services inward  communities they should  bear  their expenses. For instance, a Mozambique's company, Mozal is  devoted to aluminium exploitation in the Beluluane area, once it is  making money through the raw material of this  small area, the enterprise builds schools, roadways, and  employs the local  youth. As a result,  both  are the  greater winners, the local folk and  the company. It is the overriding reason for high develop small  lands  in Spain. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  shareholders regard  social responsibility  as  financial resources consuming.  Because of the escalated  quantity of resources  utilized in  social activities,  the owners of these  institutions  criticise the development.  60% of   business institutions  are found it a hardship  to help  societies where they operate to exemplify. It is pointed out by the new research carried out by the University  of Southampton.  Hence,  there are  soared conflicts between  the  businesses owners and communities.  Moreover, It is the  prime  purpose for the shortfall in an agreement between woodcutters and the African crowd.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, notwithstanding the lack of support from the shareholders of businesses,  these explorers  should  collaborate  and help  the local livings owing to the fact that they  lately  depend on the local resources.

        "essay": "An often debated topic is whether a government should provide its country’s artists  with assistance or not. Many believe such assistance is a prudent use of a nation’s  wealth and should thus be supported. However, others feel this kind of spending is  wasteful. Both sides of the argument will be discussed in this essay before a  conclusion is reached.  According to many, government funding of the arts can benefit a country’s cultural  identity. A good example of this is the anime art culture of Japan. Today, anime is a  globally recognized art form and as such, a huge draw for tourists. As this shows,  providing government assistance to artists can have positive ramifications across  different channels within a country. It is thus understandable why many people  support this stance.  On the other hand, many argue this kind of spending is wasteful. The core of this  argument typically spotlights developing countries. People basically feel that among  these countries government money may perhaps best be used to solve social  problems, such as establishing safe drinking water and roads to rural communities.  When looking at the discussion in this light, the merits in not utilizing government  funds on artists can be seen.  After examining both sides of the question, it is felt that in most circumstances  government assistance to artists begets greater benefits to the country at large.  Thus, it is hoped nations around the world responsibly tailor financial aid to their  artists in a manor that best benefits the needs of their people.",

        "essay": "Some today argue that only authorities are capable of countering problems in cities resulting from housing shortages. In my opinion, although the state should be the primary actor, individuals can also offer aid.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, only politics have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. authority by design makes decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the last century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.\r\n\r\nHowever, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. Individuals will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform. Governments will ideally enact laws based on the needs of the general populace.",

Personally, although there are a few potential threats coming from the emergence of robotic engineering, I believe that the merits of this form of technology could eclipse its drawbacks. \r\n\r\nYet it is unequivocally that robotic technology could fall into the wrong hand; therefore, it might be used to conduct immoral activity  or wage a war. For example, in the contemporary combat age, many cutting-edged devices have been adapted to practical combat, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles which are used to strike the enemy from distance. As a result, the life of many residents living in eras located in the war zone has been wreaked havoc as they have to deal with such hazardous confrontations  while worrying about losing their close friends and family. A prime example of this is Afghanistan, a country which has been under influence of America for over a century, citizens with  impoverished living conditions are ubiquitous here, and the waging of war has hindered their economy from thriving. \r\n\r\nHowever, in  light of robotic technological advances, human civilization has stepped another step into a brighter future, with many significant signs of progress in multi fields namely education, medicine, manufacturing, etc. Compared to  old-time manufacturing, good productivity in automatic factories has out manufactured in the past several times. By applying assembly lines to production, many ingredients could be transported and processed at the same time, which boosts productivity speed to great extent. Regarding the education sector, robotic adaption is the key factor in crafting novel and convenient methods of teaching, robotic lecturers which are programmed for a particular subject could convey detailed knowledge, while tailored-made learning programs enable learners to study at their own pace. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is advisable to grasp its advantages by spreading the use of  robots into every aspect of life, while finding a solution to reduce modern applications in  warfare.",

        "essay": "Many people state that to deal with environmental issues, government should raise fuel price for cars and other vehicles. I totally agree with this statement for the following reasons.\r\nFirstly, if authority raises taxes on petrol, this would be able to reduce the density of means of transportation. To be more specific, the number of cars for journeys will be constrained, which helps to cut down emission, a detrimental factor contributing to greenhouse effect. Statistics show that the figure of vehicles for long journeys has declined significantly by 20% since the fuel cost climbed that improves the air quality considerably in recent years. Another point to consider is that this rising in fuel price can provide the incentive for alternative fuel. In more details, people are encouraged to use fuel based on waste products such as vegetable oil or corn-based ethanol. Research show that using these environment-friendly fuels can decrease a large amount of carbon dioxide releasing to the environment. Therefore, increase in the price of fuel can limit environmental problems. \r\nDespite these, many people still claim that government can raise citizen’s awareness of some fuel efficient vehicle types instead of increasing the fuel cost. They may believe that these means of transportation have smart operation to help economize petrol and decrease the amount of exhausted gas. To this, I will argue that fuel-saving vehicles may not be a perfect solution because of customer unaffordability. Specifically, it is excessive financial cost for consumer to purchase this product. In my opinion, upgrading the infrastructure of transportation is considered to be an effective way. In other words, a good transport system can drop traffic jam which produces a vast amount of exhausted fumes causing air pollution. Clearly, improvement traffic structure is necessary for solving environmental issues.\r\nIn conclusion, there are a wide range of solutions to help cope with traffic and pollution problems. However, a substantial increase in fuel price would be a useful method for environment. It can not only help to reduce the crowd of vehicles, but also encourage people to use friendly fuel.",

        "essay": "There has been some discussion about the existence and need of parks and squares in towns and cities. While some people believe that these open premises are essential, others insist that these places make the land useless and hence they must be converted to practical purposes. In my opinion, despite the voices against the larger public places, parks and squares provide great value to both the towns and its civilians.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the open areas have always been considered as the heart of cities, where people get together for meetings and leisure activities. Besides that children and their parents spend quality time at these places after their hectic daily schedules. The increasing pollution in cities is a cause of great concern for the government and the citizens and places like parks and squares often provide relaxation to the old people. Moreover, such places attract tourists as they usually have a history behind their creation. For instance, all European towns are famous for their beautiful gardens and city center squares. Thus, it’s absolutely imperative to conserve them for the future generations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one can’t deny the fact that cities are getting crowded each day and lacking places to build public and commercial centers. New transportation systems are coming to the cities and they need a large space to build stations and wider lanes. For example, New York was planned nearly two hundred years ago and the roads in the city were small and narrow which were built for carts not for cars and buses. Later, New York city authority converted many historical parks and gardens into parking stations and highways. This transformation was publicly criticized by civilians and other town planners. Therefore, destroying parks and other public places for current benefits is not the solution for space constraints in cities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, big public grounds are the need of our future generations. Cities are facing a lot of pressure to develop a substantial infrastructure for the growing population, but this cannot be allowed at the cost of parks and squares. Therefore, it’s completely indispensable to have huge social places in the cities and towns.",

In this essay, I will discuss how other effective ways like good infrastructure, regular vehicle maintenance and awareness  improve road safety.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Good roads might  avoid road accidents. If the government provides infrastructure like good roads, traffic lights, and speed breakers in right place, there is a high chance to avoid road accidents. For instance, UK authority well maintains their roads which reduce 20% of road accidents  every year. Likewise, regular vehicle maintenance helps to avoid road accidents. a person who drives a vehicle in the bad condition  face difficulties during driving which may lead to  severe accidents. The government set regulations to check the vehicle condition  every year might avoid this kind of accidents. For example, In India authorities should check the vehicle condition every year and provide an FC certificate, a person who drives a vehicle without an FC certificate should be punished.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Administration set an awareness campaign about  road accident for  people may give more responsibility to  societies. communities had a lack of awareness about  road safety.Government should advertise the importance of wearing helmets as well as a seat belts to the people. For example, In 2016, Bajaj company set a campaign and they told how many  bikers are dead on highways because of not following the road rules.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, punishment for the driving offence is one of the way to improve road safety but it's not the only way.

        "prompt": "Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages",
        "essay": "In this contemporary epoch, some parents consider delaying childbirth whose reasons will be discussed in this essay. Both the advantage and disadvantage will also be put under scrutiny although I lean towards the former statement. \r\n\r\nThere are several justifications that could explain why some people would prefer to have children later in life. First and foremost, for some parents, giving birth in young adulthood puts a strain on their financial and career plans. Nurturing a child requires myriads of expenses for nutrition, health care, and education which will exert financial issues on the young parents ,hence hindering the living standard of the family. Another possible reason is that young couples are not psychologically ready to raise a child. They are not mentally aware of how tremendous the responsibility and magnitude of parental skills really are. Therefore, bringing up a child would genuinely discourage them and negatively affect their work-life balance. \r\n\r\nThis phenomenon indicates quite a serious drawback, in which the benefit it brings appears to be less significant. Young parents who have been financially and mentally stable have a tendency to nurture a child more fulfilling. Their offspring is more likely to be exposed to better education, and manner and become more well-rounded later in life. Having said that, delaying childbirth involves high risks of health-related issues for the mother and the baby. The child could suffer from a physical or mental disability due to the poor pregnancy process of middle-aged mothers. In a more severe scenario, the birth-giving process could be fatal and result in the death of either family member. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the two primary reasons why young people decide to postpone childbirth are the lack of resources and mental awareness to raise a child. Despite the cited benefit, this trend is still more of a drawback.",

        "prompt": "Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.",
        "essay": "While it  is often argued by some people that financial issues for the old age people should need to backing by local state ministry, whereas others take the view of that basic needs for aged people by own means .My opinion is that it is better to offer help to older people.\r\n\r\nOne side of the argument, there are people who hold the position that the basic necessity of retired people is taken care of themselves  .The most compelling reason is that they no need to depend on their own children or government to support their daily life. Furthermore,after the children's marriage,they will be separated by them and live the         remaining life lonely.The Asian countries are prime examples, about 80% of the aged populations are tend to live separately.\r\n\r\nDespite the above arguments, I am of the view that local governance gives more priority to the aged population. Indeed, one reason why I believe is that the older generation people are mostly retired from their profession and spend rest of life lonely.Additionally, many people do have medical complications as becoming older and older. Consequently, the medicines are quite expensive now a day's which is not affordable for them. To illustrate, the New York Times published an  article about the survival of elders in this contemporary era. As a result, there is a  shortage of monthly income and ministry could lend their hands for them. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while both views are held in society and I strongly believe that ministry support as much as needed for them. This is because of elders facing difficulties with lower annual income and medical expenses. Given this situation, it is recommended that in order to care for older people, government around the world should think about implementing this form of support.",

        "essay": "Women play a major role in computing for centuries. However, only 20% of the women are in tech-based jobs. This essay will discuss some of the problems that women face and what can be the possible ways to help them get successful in their tech domain.\r\n\r\nAccording to the past surveys, computing sector is one of the worst impacted career fields when it comes to sexual orientation. One of the foremost reasons are that they are unappreciated in the workplace. Moreover, the higher authorities show doubt in the chances of women addressing and resolving specialized issues. Another reason is that the working women come from a family where there is a chaos and pressure from both the family and work push them into a deep pit from where they are trying to escape from a long time. Most of their energy is spent totally on validating their balance.\r\n\r\nThe organization should take these issues seriously and try to solve it by sensitizing sexual orientations at the workplace, such as providing them the opportunity and support to lead the team, appreciating them occassionally that will motivate them to give their best. Family should aid them by removing the society obstructions pushed on them. Ladies should feel more secured and protected all the time.\r\n\r\nThere are diverse companies such as McKinsey, believe that women in computers greatly outweigh any costs. The best way to shrink the women in computing is to encourage them to consider technology careers. They can always volunteer for the projects even if they might not have enough knowledge to learn and outsource themselves.",

        "prompt": "Some people believe that eventually all the jobs will be done by artificial intelligence robots. What is your opinion?",
        "essay": "Artificial intelligence will take over most of the job opportunities in the future. Although effort that involves minor human interaction might take over by robots,  there will be certainly a workforce needed to fulfil a profession that requires maintaining human relationships. This essay will dictate pointers to support why the human workforce cannot be completely replaced through machinery.\r\n\r\nRobots may eventually replace businesses where a human brain is not needed o fulfil necessary tasks. Many companies will choose to invest in artificial intelligence which instead is a cheaper resource as compared to hiring an individual. For instance, a lot of companies in Canada are switching to driverless trucks which are taking away effort opportunities from truck drivers. For these reasons, a lot of labour would be accomplished with the help of machines instead of people.\r\n\r\nConversely, there are jobs that cannot be replaced because bots will never achieve the capability to accomplish them. There are plenty of jobs that would always require  human assistance. To cite an example, fields such as Medicine, Psychology, Education, and social work are impossible for machineries to attain  because there will be always a need to have a human touch while implementing those tasks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a significant number of assignments will be conducted by artificial intellect in the future. However, a plethora of skills, as well as emotions are not inherited in the artificial intelligence to perform tasks that require major contributions by humans. Ultimately, in ,future there will be a balance between the work achieved with the help of individuals and robots.",

        "essay": "The existence of robots in human life has generated  diverse opinions in society. Some people believe that robots are crucial for humanity, while others argue  they are dangerous. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my view  regarding the  roles of robots in shaping humans' future.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technological development is an inevitable aspect of human progress, particularly for medical purposes. Nowadays,  several medics use robots to assist in  medical surgery. For instance, complex surgical procedures now employ robotic systems that offer 3D visualisation and precise tool control. This technology can reduce the risk of errors in medical surgery.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rapid advancement of robotics technology raises concerns about its potential negative consequences for society. One of the concerns is its impact on employment as robots are increasingly capable of replacing human workers. For example, the emergence of artificial intelligence with a language-processing system has raised questions about the viability of human jobs like content writing and publishing. Media companies now can utilise robots for content writing in a short time which suits their target of content production. While industries may benefit from cost savings by employing robots, this development is a significant threat for people's job security.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the presence of robots in our society  has created more innovation in appliance science like medical surgery which can  prevent the potential errors in medical treatments. While concerns about job displacement are valid, it is essential for society to adapt and gain potential benefits of robotics. By adapting these technologies responsibly, I believe humans can create a better future where humans can take benefits from robots and increase overall human’s life qualities.",

        "essay": "These days a lot of people have tended to know the history of their living place – house or even building for the different matters. There are many reasons for this and I am going to find them in this essay.\r\n\r\nThere are different situations when people wish or need to understand the history of their current or future accommodation. First of all, in case of the deals with real estate buyers want to be ensure that the flat or house has a “white history” and will not give and problems or dangers after the deal. In Russia, for instance, the sheet with details about the previous owners and their actions with the object is one of the most important documents for buyers to make their final decision. Another reason is a possibility to make any renovation in the house or flat. In this situation it is sufficient to know about some others redecorations in the past.\r\n\r\nThere are some different ways how to find information about some object and this is not as difficult as many years ago. For example, most countries have a registry with records about any changes of all objects in the county. Additionally, information about the accommodation easy is taken from the talking with neighbours who could live near a long time and know the full history of the building and its owners.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt that knowledge of the accommodation history is a very helpful and important part of our life.

        "prompt": "Some people think the governments should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve the environments problems. to what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "essay": "It is irrefutable that massive usage of fossil fuels exacerbates the environmental issues. Hence, many people believe if price of fuel is raised then it would solve all the biohazards. I do not agree that just focussing on one specific area which is tiny part of this humongous problem is the solution; this essay will discuss why.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking such measure does more damage compared to the benefit. Because of increase in fuel rates, there could be conflicts amongst the common man and the administration. Having taken such step of hiking prices would fill public with rage lead to curfews and sloganeering, for instance, hence, disrupting balance in the society. Moreover, despite the fact that traffic might decrease due to this step, motor companies will suffer and it would affect the national economy directly. However, if more effective ways like using electricity produced by solar energy or other renewable energy sources are used to power the motor vehicles then above stated issues can be governed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, major air pollutants are the gases and and residues from the industrial waste. Carbon emission from vehicles doesnt affect the ecosystem much as compared to toxic waste generated by industries. All kinds of greenhouse gases like nitrogen, methane, carbon monooxide etc. are discharged by manufacturing companies without treating them, this in turn leads to spike in temprature which directly impacts the climate in detrimental way. Therefore, having appropriate waste management facilities to treat \r\ncontaminated and toxic waste before releasing into environment would help and expidite the process of saving our ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the nutshell, this essay discussed the reasons why raising fuel price is not a effective answer to environmental problems including decline in nation's economy due hit in motor companies and industrial waste is teh major catalyst to the biohazard. Hence, rather than increasing fuel price having proper waste management facilities should be the focus. In my opnion, I disagree that just fuel price hike is not the answer to solve environmental problems.",
