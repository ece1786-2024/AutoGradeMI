        "prompt":"In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What is your opinion about it?",
        "essay":"In contemporary settings, due to the prevalence of the feminist movement, more and more females are hired in some industries which conventionally are the domains of males. The contributors of this transformation will be discussed in this essay along with the reasons why I believe this is a blessing rather than a curse. Multiple factors facilitate this trend.\r\n\r\n To be more specific, an increasing number of women receive tertiary education and thus, the professional knowledge obtained from such experience enables them to enter \/ join some companies, working as engineers, scientists and lawyers. In addition, several decades ago, most tasks were performed by hand, which made men in an advantageous position due to their relatively stronger bodies. By contrast, nowadays, the vast majority of manual jobs are performed by machines, and the requirement for workers is not strength but the skills of operating these mechanics, which makes the females on a par with their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nThis improvement exerts a positive influence on both females and their families. Women are always detail-oriented, so if they are working as scientists or doctors, they have higher chances of obtaining huge success. A good example is a female scientist Madame Curie who attributed her success in the discovery of the element Ra to the fact that she identified the minor difference in their daily research outcomes. Consequently, by focusing on these divergences and doing deep research, she found the element and reaped a breakthrough in their research. Besides, formerly, the roles of women were confined to being housewives, which earned them no salaries. Hence, their families depended on their huslabels\u2019 salaries, but in  modern times, the combined salaries of both huslabels and wives enable them to have better lifestyles.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the reasons for the increase in women\u2019s involvement in work which used to be done by men are their educational qualifications and the development of technologies which eliminate manual labour.",

        "prompt":"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.\r\n\r\nDo the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?",
        "essay":"In recent times, most families chose to attain eld before bearing offspring. I personally believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages as this can lead to some complications during labour. These points will be further explained in the subsequent paragraphs with appropriate examples.\n\nTo begin,  women conceiving at later stages are associated with it's own merit which is attaining financial stability before becoming parents. Marriage is a union that results in the production of children at the desired time as agreed by the couples. Money is a standing factor that enhances growth in a relationship,  therefore not giving birth immediately after marriage, helps both man and woman to plan ahead for the future as well as creating sufficient time to build experiences and gather ideas.\n\nHowever, late childbearing also has its own demerits which are complications during delivery. Experience, ideas and resources can be acquired longer in marriage but death as a result of health conditions developed by an old first-time mother can not be reversed. According to research, male and female are most productive between years 25- 32. Although pregnancy is viable outside those ages. Critical health cases could be diagnosed such as foetal or maternal death,  fibroid, uterine rupture, cervical laceration,  eclampsia and bleeding during and after delivery may occur. Early child production will help avoid this demerit. For example,  I recently had an encounter with a woman who got wedded at 28 years but waited till age 33 before conceiving. Unfortunately, she lost her strength during labour which led to caesarian section and post-partum bleeding.\n\nIn conclusion,  the accumulation of enough ideas about marriage as well as finances is an excellent decision. However,  the terrible health complications caused by late childbearing can not be overlooked.",

        "prompt":"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "essay":"There are controversial views about whether economic developments could address indigence and famine or harm the natural world. I believe national and local authorities should limit the growth business world, due to its pollution.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many advocates for the growth of the economy would solve hunger and poverty. In other words, cash crops and other modern business operations not only supply sufficient food for the ever-increasing population but also generate profit for the rich and create jobs for workers. By earning money, impoverished families might improve the standard of living and afford their children\u2019s education. However, there are two drawbacks of this approach. Firstly, the profit generated from many industrial sectors benefit merely investors, not their employees and poor people. Secondly, the natural world is at the expense of the industrialisation and modernisation of humankind. For example, many lakes are now polluted because of the toxic waste discharged by factories.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while economic increase could be a stopgap measure for hunger and indigence, the environmental problems it causes must be recognised, so governments should introduce restrictions on numerous economic sectors. To be specific, the innovative industry is at the root of environmental degradation. In the last decade, governments and companies have sped their development rates and made a vast fortune, leading to more frequent and severe catastrophes, such as floods and droughts, which account for the starvation and poverty occurring in developing nations. Therefore, curbing modern businesses is a means of natural conservation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some individuals believe the answer to starvation and indigence would lie in the evolution of the economy, I would argue that this development results in environmental problems. As a result, the development of the economy must be limited.",

        "prompt":"Some people decided to have children in their late age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?",
        "essay":"Nowadays, with the development of many types of life such as urbanization, the development of industries, etc that makes people become busier and busier. They have to obey the circulation of life and their attitudes have to be changed to come up with their life. One of the significant changes is that more and more families tend to have children at a late age than in the past. This essay will discuss this phenomenon through various relevant examples to support it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the merits, there are at least 2 advantages that can be observed when bearing children late. According to the decision, the couples can have much time to prepare and sort out their life before having some new members to the family. Before bearing a kid, they have to suffer from the calculation of the financial burden. They have to make sure about their abilities to take care of any kids in their home. Because of the issues, more and more couples believe they ought to stand in an ideal position before doing that great task. Last but not least, this is a period for the young families to enjoy themselves more. For example, with the exception of crowded outdoor life, that is the time for couples to enjoy together through many trips, picnic\u2026 and enjoy the feeling of the wonderful youth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people have to suffer from no less than 2 main drawbacks belonging to this phenomenon. Initially, this can reduce the success rate of conception in women. Because each lady has a period of ideal ages to bear. The more ages they have, the more difficult they concept successfully. Secondly, this can restrict the number of offspring that can be born per family. When more and more families do not want to bear, this will affect the quality of the population chart and this will be a burden on the economy of any country. Finally, this phenomenon can lead to the lack of mental health of any offspring in the old parents compared to the young parents. When every people achieve a determined age, they wouldn\u2019t have enough health and enthusiasm to experience new things. So, it\u2019s a massive lack of children who have old daddy and mommy when they don\u2019t have a trip to explore the new destinations or the bigger generation gap compared to the younger family.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of any parents is seeing the total growth of every child of them. To take this, every father and mother, let\u2019s choose a suitable age to start making their own nuclear family, not too old but not too young, to bring an ideal environment for kids to grow and become a wonderful continuous generation in the future.",

        "essay":"Universities are offering many online courses for the convinience of people. Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.\r\nPrima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.\r\nWhile remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.\r\nIn a nutshell though online education comes with some good feature but can never replace the physical\/regular education system.",

        "essay":"Every country faces global environmental problems and they are very concerned about how to decrease those problems. Although, it is sometimes thought the best way to solve it to increase the cost of fuel. In my opinion, I considered that environmental issues can be solved in different manners.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons to decline the matter of global environmental. The first and foremost important thing is that to ban the single-use of plastic. Plastic is a non-biodegradable item and it is very harmful to the environment. For instance, in one survey has conducted in the UK, 50% of environmental causes are happened by plastic. In addition, if government take a strict action against use of plastic such as plastic bottles, straws, carry bags and so on so,it is possible to reduce that problem.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider to solve the environmental problem is to encourage people for more plantations. In big cities, more people are doing deforestations to build tall buildings and industries and it is also affects weather changes. For example, without trees it is very hard to keep the air clean and neat and people are getting a lack of rain. Hence, palnts and trees are the best way to stop that problems.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fuel is responsible for getting more issues in environment. nowadays persons prefer their own vehicles for transportations and this trend is booming. In addition, raising the cost of fule could be help to fall down the global warming.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, numerous ways are available to solve the global environmental issues and government should encourage people to use  renewable things and try to solve them.",

        "essay":"In this contemporary era, in several countries, knowing the history of the properties has been interesting for the owners. In my opinion, various reasons are affecting people to think about the past times. I am also convinced that they can enquire about these buildings from different resources. \r\n\r\nIt is my view that what absorbs people is the sense of connection. To put it in another way, people find it intriguing to be knowledgeable in possessing\u2019 history as they feel closer to that house. Moreover, not only does it enhance the connection with ancient people but also it enriches individuals\u2019 curiosity. Therefore, numerous people have a personal interest in history and the history of their owners gives them an opportunity to fulfil this personal passion. For example, an ancient building in Kave Street was for one of the king\u2019s ministers which resulted in a written book by its owner, owing to research and gaining information about that building and the past.\r\n\r\nI further believe that people can augment their knowledge by enquiring about the elderly of that neighbourhood and the municipality plays a substantial role as well. In addition, some online websites can assist people in this field. For instance, the public can search for the roots of constructed palaces and their reasons on different websites. Although people should ensure that those sites are trustworthy, rarely does it happen that the government\u2019s sites share wrong information.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, augmenting the connection with possess and their personal interest brings about research about the history of that building. From my perspective, the public can enquire from the elderly and use the municipalities\u2019 websites to raise their awareness about the property.",

        "essay":"Many people have expressed that a number of reports detailing crime news should be controlled, as they have many negative effects on society. I partly agree with this view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I believe the bad influences that stem from two main reasons. Firstly, the direct result of crime news with extremely details are to bring victims psychological injury. To pique readers\u2019 interest, the media may use the bloody images and exaggerated language. This reminds me of a school murder that occurred in China.The local media had numerous reports on the atrocious detail of crimes. Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate. It not only to victim's mental health caused some damage, but also to the whole community to bring about a great potential threat. So the media should not report too many details of crimes to the public. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the crime news can serve as a public warning. People can enhance their guarding consciousness in order to avoid becoming a victim, and also  assist the police in remaining alert. For example, the media report criminal news in a public place to arouse our social concern. The police can use this information to strengthen the force of supervision in this areas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I argue that detail of crimes in the media are likely to invite various problems, and we should limit them to protect people from harm.",

While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic wideninig, if improved, can lead to decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to this development for example, if a person gets quality education, this will align to the self development of that individual as well as contributes to the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacture goods, services, etc. As a  result of this it will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he\/she from sufferings like poverty.

        "essay":"No doubt, parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children. Since children are too young to understand what is right or wrong, it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in the right direction. Hence, I agree with the argument that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their minor children.\r\n\r\nChildren have impressionable minds. They acquire their values and morals from their parents. For instance, kids born in a good family often listen to good words and moral stories from the elderly family members. Therefore, when they find themselves in a difficult or unfavourable situation, they know how to keep their emotions in check and behave politely. This restraint that they learn from their family will prevent them from acting aggressively and getting into trouble.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, a child coming from a bad family may assimilate the bad qualities of their parents. Since they often get exposed to verbal and physical abuse they will assume that violence and aggression are normal and acceptable. It is only a matter of time before they commit crimes outside the home. For example, in India, the mother of a 14 year old boy was penalized for allowing her son to drive a four wheeler. The boy caused an accident and the judge who heard the case held his mother responsible because in his opinion, it was her duty to prevent her underage son from driving. Thus, obviously, parents are responsible for the actions of their children.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that the role of parents in raising law abiding citizens with social commitment is of utmost importance. Hence, I believe that parents should be held accountable for the wrong acts of their children.",

        "essay":"When thinking about whether their children should be taught by teachers at school or educated themselves at home, most parents probably fall somewhere into two extremes. On the one side is the approach taken by most ordinary parents, who have made great endeavours to send their children to the most prominent schools.  \r\n\r\nOn the other is the view expressed by an increasing number of writers, film stars and artists that the normal education system is unsuitable for their children and its necessity and value are yet to be confirmed. From my perspective, parental education itself could not take the place of school.   \r\n\r\nIt is widely admitted that some parents are already the best teachers in certain areas, such as music, painting, writing and vice versa. For those parents, they tend to find what the normal school taught is useless and even harmful to their children's development. However, they overlook two facts. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, besides being a place for learning, school also functions as a communication center where various views and comments are equally expressed and exchanged, which parents could not easily replace. After all, an artist or a writer that has already made prominent contributions to one area is more likely to be biased when it comes to opposite voices unless they do not have faith in what they are working on. Nevertheless, a child needs to weigh in diversified facts in their perspective rather than replicate what their parents think.   \r\n\r\nFor another, children could also benefit from school life even if nothing was learned. At school, peers gather together and they gradually learn to cooperate and communicate efficiently with each other. Furthermore, witnessing children with different personality or even from various cultures, they figure out the importance of embracing differences and finally the colorful world.   \r\n\r\nAll in all, missing the opportunity of school results in loss of diversity and failure to acquire interpersonal skills. Hence, its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.",

I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned ideas. \r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, I think that understanding family history is extremely imperative to each person, it can bring numerous benefits. One of those is that they can have more assistance in their society from many other relatives. In other words, when we research our family trees, we can have contact with more relations that we have not ever known before. By doing so, we can get more help from them in a place far from home. For example, if you are a student and you want to study in foreign lands, such as France, Germany and so forth, you should know about your relatives in those lands in order that you can get numerous useful help during your learning journeys. Thus, I believe that perceiving our own family backgrounds is significantly important because we can have support from our unknown relations when we need.   \r\n\r\nWhile the importance of learning family trees is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of concentrating on present and later generations is ignored. Focusing on guiding the present and forthcoming generations can make our society better.

For example, Vietnamese people always try numerous ways to fully improve their successors, which make Vietnam become one of the fastest developing countries in Asia now. Hence, putting attention on the current and upcoming generations is significantly crucial for community improvement.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that both studying our family in the past and concentrating on educating our current and upcoming generations are equally significant in different aspects.

Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events.

        "essay":"Interviews are a common selection method for many companies, but they are not the only method. Other methods such as skills tests, reference checks, and work samples may provide a more accurate assessment of a candidate's abilities and fit for the job.\r\n\r\nWhile interviews can give an initial impression of a candidate, they may not provide a complete picture of their skills, personality, and work style. Interviews may also be subject to biases, such as unconscious biases or interviewer biases, which can affect the outcome of the selection process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some candidates may perform well in an interview but not be a good fit for the job, while others may not perform as well in an interview but have the necessary skills and qualities for the job.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while interviews can be a useful selection method, they should not be relied on solely to make hiring decisions. Combining interviews with other selection methods may provide a more comprehensive assessment of candidates and increase the chances of making a successful hire.",

        "prompt":"Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "essay":"The potential increase in global media has brought a great change in the education system, where some commentators argue that it is important for teenagers to know global news as a part of their study programme. However, some analysts defend it is unnecessary and a waste of time. I strongly believe learning international current affairs help teenagers to understand what is happening in the world. This essay will explain the importance of current affairs as a part of school study programme by taking examples from recent studies. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, bringing global current affairs as a subject in secondary school will help teenagers to be competent with current changes across the globe. The main reason for this is, studying global news at school stage will potentially inspire them to bring change in the future. The recent study from The University of Melbourne of Child Psychology, revealed that 65 % teenagers set their life goals by looking at current affairs news. Perhaps, learning global news at secondary school level will help them to know what to do in future. \r\n\r\nSecondly, secondary school is the perfect age for the teenager to get inspired. However, there are some drawbacks by bringing global current affairs as part of study programme. Firstly, teenagers will attract to negative news very easily than positive. Moreover, due to lack of maturity, they might take wrong decisions. The recent study of Child's Crime, Psychology shows that, teenagers are the most vulnerable group to attract for crime. As a result, adding global news in school study programme is not a good idea. \r\n\r\nConsidering all this, I firmly believe that global news in secondary school as a subject will potentially benefit the teenager to understand what they want in the future.",

        "essay":"Generally,office interviews are the best part to analyse the aspirant and learn about him.However,there are some people who don't approve of the following idea and believe that there are other factors that can help employees assess whether the contender can be hired or not for the particular position.I suppose,there are other several ways to know better about a aspirant, including the interview as well.  \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, as it is vividly seen for all of us , job interviews play a key role in hiring any employee. Because the majority of the interviewers can know a lot about an applicant on the first day of their meeting. The first day leaves a great impression ( whether it is positive or negative) on both sides. For example, if an interviewee is late for an interview we can conclude that this employee is not quite responsible and won't show satisfactory results later as well. Moreover, during the ,interview an interviewer carefully checks all the details and small items of a person and can tell many things about him\/her.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, according to another group of ,people there are some other ways that can help us judge an employee. Many bosses usually use a wide variety of methods and one of them is, giving a worker tougher pressure. They tend to pressurise their employees by ordering them multiple tasks and by this they find whether they can get rid of that moment wisely or not. Additionally, observations during  work time can also be handy in cases where we should decide on a applicant whether he is suitable in a labour market or not. \r\n\r\nOur discussions above show that, there are certain factors excluding interviews that can help us find out better about an applicant in a profession market.",

        "prompt":"some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?",
        "essay":"Many believed artificially intelligent robots will soon take over most jobs from human beings. While the robots\u2019 ability might fit well for most repetitive jobs, it is difficult to replace jobs that require human creativity with the A.I. This essay will discuss why our creativity at work is difficult for AI to imitate in certain occupations.\r\n\r\nFor duties requiring a same standard, the artificial robots might be better candidates than the humans. Robots can be programmed to execute repetitive motions which make them a perfect task force of production to meet strict quality controls. For instance, in Japanese catering industry, most procedures in fast food production are operated by the machines, thus the taste and outlook of each frozen meals are all identical. Therefore, it is foreseeable that many of the similar tasks could be delivered by robots instead.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, jobs that involve human creation might be difficult for machines to perform. Human\u2019s ability in perceiving and expressing news ideas are unique; it cannot be duplicated by programming. Great authors touched hearts of millions by observing the humanity and deliver in a story; artists communicate with their audience by paintings or sculptures and the emotion resonates with our hearts. Even if we programme robots with the most versatile vocabularies or the best art-crafting techniques, robots could not produce masterpieces like \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d or \u201cStarry Night\u201d. That is the reason why in some aspects machines could never win over human beings.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, robots are expected to become dominant in jobs in specific areas. Robots are highly qualified for repetitive labouring; whereas jobs that require imagination might not be at robots\u2019 expertise. Ultimately, few occupations might still be safe from robots\u2019 seizure comparing to the major robot employment in the future.",

This essay will explore which are the reasons influenced by the main problem and express my view in the end.  \r\n\r\nFirst of all, in different parts of the world, people prefer to use  bicycles rather than cars. It has a number of benefits, such as it will help to enhance their energetic level. In modern society,  half of the public suffering from obesity, heart diseases, high blood pleasure\u2026etc. If you using bikes you could reduce illness and increased the level of energy and boosting the immunity system. Moreover, people could use the bike-sharing scheme and it would be more affordable price compared to  cars. In recent years, CO2 emissions have also high and  environmental pollution has been increased as much more.Cycling is more popular in different parts of the globe and it will help to decreased pollution and traffic level in the urban area.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people prefer to choose cars. Because it has a number of advantages rather than drawbacks, such as being faster, comfortable and more convenient. In modern society, we can use driverless or electric vehicles as well. Technology has changed our daily routine. Many people have to work on  busy schedules. If you have a car you could use your vehicle to going the workplace, the market, university and it would help to save your valuable time. However, it would be very easy rather than raiding a bike.\r\n\r\nFinally, from my point of view, according to  modern ,society people need to get cars to fulfilling their basic requirements.

        "essay":"The young age population have an important impact on  society, so some nations have the policy to increase that population number. From my perspective, those countries have to experience  significant growth in jobs related to this age group and in the future, the impact of elderly illness will be reduced. This essay will discuss the current and forthcoming impacts in more detail.\r\n\r\nIn the current time, as the figure of youngest age group increased the jobs related to this population increased as well. This is because  there is a huge demand for many services to serve this group. For example, when there were more than 15 million children in Egypt in the 1980s, the figure of teachers either in schools or kindergarten was increased by 50% according to the Egyptian government. Without an increase in the number of teachers, there were children with no education chance. Therefore, many jobs have been created as a consequence of the ever-increasing proportion of  people aged  15 or younger. \r\n\r\nIn the future, as more population who are younger than 15 years, the impact of elderly diseases will be eliminated. Because, the elderly people proportion will the smallest. In Nigeria, for instance, there is a study that expects the rate of back diseases will be less than 10% in 2030 according to a London university study. Without this trend, the reduction in the rate of older people illness will be not possible. Therefore, in the next years, there will be a reduction in the rate of elderly age group diseases as a result of increasing young people proportion. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some countries have to ever increase the youngest group portion. I believe this trend has to raise the number of professions related to this group and in the  future is expected to reduce the level of elderly illness.",

        "essay":"The recent development of technology has threatened certain types of occupations. Hence, some claim that in the near future almost all jobs will be invaded by these machines. In my opinion, of course robots will play a significant role in the future, but they will not take over the whole job market.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, each an every machine or robot has been designed and developed by human minds. Yes, it is true that these artificial creatures can do a lot of things. But, someone needs to program with correct instructions in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decisions because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence. Moreover, these devices should be designed by someone, always those tasks are done by human beings. For instance, a robot can instruct to repair a car, yet it could not instruct to design a car. Because that needs a higher level of intelligence. Another common fact is that robots cannot process empathy. As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors who need social skills.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour works do not need much of brain power. Those work only needs to repeat some actions. Hence, those types of work will be done by robots in the future. As a result, people should move away from work that only needs physical strength and learn the work require metal skills. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although some jobs are taken over by robots, these electronic and mechanical devices will not be able to take over the occupations that need empathy and higher intelligence levels.",

        "essay":"In this modern world, there is a new tendency to have children in the family  later. While some believe that this contention has more benefits than demerits, others have different beliefs. This essay will discuss  both advantages and disadvantages and which of both has more outweigh.\r\n\r\nHaving infants at older age depend on the couple's decision. Most of the time, individuals  tend to have a successful career in their early stages of life, and then at ,later they can afford a financially stable life for their children. In order to give a quality life to their successors, it is important to have a stress-free family background. When couples become mature over  time, it is rare to have family break-ups and inter-family conflicts. One of the latest research revealed, that, in the USA, Couples who work in the IT industry tend to have their children when they are around 35-40 years old. That report clearly shows that  with all the considerable data those parents are the best to raise  healthy and well-mannered offspring.\r\n\r\nAlthough the aforementioned positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, with  time, both men and women have genetic degradation which can directly have an impact on a child's genetic defects such as Down's Syndrome and Autism. Although, these elders  lack the strength to play with their youngsters, as they have more energy compared to their parents. As an example, if parents are in their 60s, it is difficult to work and understand infants who are in their 20s. The generation gap is the most dangerous factor that can destroy the bond of a family.\r\n\r\nIn sum, given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of having children at older ages, it is reasonable to conclude that, it is more beneficial to conceive offspring at an early stage of life.",

        "essay":"There is no doubt that online education has become a new learning trend. However, while I agree that they also have negative aspects, still I believe that this advanced technology is mainly beneficial to  individuals. In this essay, I will  support my view with examples.\r\n\r\n During the coronavirus pandemic, offline schooling became more challenging. The universities had to start web-based classes, in order to stop coronavirus from affecting the younger generation's health. In initial studies, it was declared that this virus is more dangerous to the youth. In such a situation, it was difficult to continue the academic system without wasting kids studies and maintaining their health. At that time, virtual tuitions were only the possible option that can save school learner's years and well-being simultaneously. due to this solution, the youngsters can connect with their teachers and faculty. They can learn new concepts and clear their doubts. Moreover, they can even conduct digital examinations.\r\n\r\nAnother major advantage of attending  such courses is that it saves time. Nowadays, time plays a crucial role in our life. If a working person wants to pursue a specific program then it may become difficult for him to make a balance between his job and exams, as he also needs to travel to his university to attend the classes. As a consequence, it becomes hard to concentrate on both the tasks and he may lose his focus and leads to mental pressure. While applying for such alternatives, it can save his travelling time and he can also utilize his travelling  time in learning. In recent years, there are many applications are available in the market and with their ,help you can select your stream. One such example is the Upgrade application. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite there are few reasons why we should value offline education, I'm inclined to consider that the pros of online education outnumber the cons.",

        "essay":"Art is an important culture in the world. Art promotes an understanding and appreciation of the uniqueness of our different cultures, stories, experiences and personal perspectives. This is the focus of debate, and there are two reasons  it behind. The first reason is that children think art is a most important subject . The second is that children are affected by their impeded learning. In this essay, the possible reasons behind and measures of my views on the following points.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that people think art is basically subject for kids in school.In  art education, while children are growing up  art is shouldn't without in their life. Art provides people with an enhanced awareness of our diverse culture in the world. By contrast, destroying the children's time is the other problem. It would be a busy learning environment in Hong Kong. Toughen schedules, and massive homework both torture  children every day.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certainly dangers in taking time off if don\u2019t take the subject of art in the children's school life. Children may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an art academic environment. In the fact, they are only learning  the main subjects like Chinese, English, and Maths. Children can not establish their self-esteem and raise  their confidence in different fields of the subject. But overall, I think this is less likely today, most of the schools involve the subject of art, and organise a campaign of competition of art, it is overweighed to nothing. \r\n\r\nMy view is that children should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Children with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated to pay attention to art , which is the best way to gain a deeper diverse vision of themselves.",

        "essay":"The importance of art in the school curriculum is a polarizing issue. While some people believe that studying art is a waste of time, others think it helps children enhance important skills. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and then I will give my own opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are reasons why schools should not place great emphasis on art. The first reason is that this subject offers limited future employment prospects. In other words, a career in art is often unstable and short-lived compared to non-art professions. Another reason is that not many students are artistically gifted, which is a prerequisite for a successful career. Forcing such students to study art would only take time away from other subjects and thus affect their overall performance at school.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, art offers great benefits to schoolchildren. Firstly, it enhances their creativity. In art classes, learners are encouraged to think creatively. For example, they can learn how to blend colours available to them to create different hues for their paintings. As creativity is crucial in many fields, learning art is likely to be beneficial to young learners in their later life, especially in their future career. Secondly, their fine motor skills are also honed. In other words, drawing or painting requires dexterity and hand-eye coordination. In fact, many studies have shown that these skills will later translate into better academic outcomes for children in other subjects including writing, literacy, mathematics, and science.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, judging from the benefits it offers, I completely agree that art plays an essential role in children\u2019s development and therefore should not be removed from the school curriculum.",
