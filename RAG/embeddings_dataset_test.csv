In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What is your opinion about it?,"In contemporary settings, due to the prevalence of the feminist movement, more and more females are hired in some industries which conventionally are the domains of males. The contributors of this transformation will be discussed in this essay along with the reasons why I believe this is a blessing rather than a curse. Multiple factors facilitate this trend.

 To be more specific, an increasing number of women receive tertiary education and thus, the professional knowledge obtained from such experience enables them to enter / join some companies, working as engineers, scientists and lawyers. In addition, several decades ago, most tasks were performed by hand, which made men in an advantageous position due to their relatively stronger bodies. By contrast, nowadays, the vast majority of manual jobs are performed by machines, and the requirement for workers is not strength but the skills of operating these mechanics, which makes the females on a par with their male counterparts. 

This improvement exerts a positive influence on both females and their families. Women are always detail-oriented, so if they are working as scientists or doctors, they have higher chances of obtaining huge success. A good example is a female scientist Madame Curie who attributed her success in the discovery of the element Ra to the fact that she identified the minor difference in their daily research outcomes. Consequently, by focusing on these divergences and doing deep research, she found the element and reaped a breakthrough in their research. Besides, formerly, the roles of women were confined to being housewives, which earned them no salaries. Hence, their families depended on their huslabels’ salaries, but in  modern times, the combined salaries of both huslabels and wives enable them to have better lifestyles.

In conclusion, the reasons for the increase in women’s involvement in work which used to be done by men are their educational qualifications and the development of technologies which eliminate manual labour.",8,7.5
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In recent times, most families chose to attain eld before bearing offspring. I personally believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages as this can lead to some complications during labour. These points will be further explained in the subsequent paragraphs with appropriate examples.

To begin,  women conceiving at later stages are associated with it's own merit which is attaining financial stability before becoming parents. Marriage is a union that results in the production of children at the desired time as agreed by the couples. Money is a standing factor that enhances growth in a relationship,  therefore not giving birth immediately after marriage, helps both man and woman to plan ahead for the future as well as creating sufficient time to build experiences and gather ideas.

However, late childbearing also has its own demerits which are complications during delivery. Experience, ideas and resources can be acquired longer in marriage but death as a result of health conditions developed by an old first-time mother can not be reversed. According to research, male and female are most productive between years 25- 32. Although pregnancy is viable outside those ages. Critical health cases could be diagnosed such as foetal or maternal death,  fibroid, uterine rupture, cervical laceration,  eclampsia and bleeding during and after delivery may occur. Early child production will help avoid this demerit. For example,  I recently had an encounter with a woman who got wedded at 28 years but waited till age 33 before conceiving. Unfortunately, she lost her strength during labour which led to caesarian section and post-partum bleeding.

In conclusion,  the accumulation of enough ideas about marriage as well as finances is an excellent decision. However,  the terrible health complications caused by late childbearing can not be overlooked.",7,7.0
"nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Many famous people are well-known for their glamour and rich instead of their achievements in society; thus, some people would argue that it could make a negative effect on the youth generation. This essay completely agrees with the statement above because of toxic things like smoking and sometimes they could extend the wrong information affecting teenagers’ life.

 

First and foremost, well-known people could affect negatively the young generations through their lifestyles. It means that some humans could follow their favourite superstars to tattoo  their faces or use illicit drugs when they are inspired by their idols through social media. For example, many teenagers have a trend to use drugs like vape, cocaine, and alcohol when they see their famous singers and celebrities using them on live streams without thinking about the effects.

Furthermore, numerous celebrities can lead to misunderstanding among the youth generation. That is to say, some famous humans didn’t focus on their studies, but they were still successful, and it also means that their fans could unexpectedly raise awareness of the wrong information that they can also be wealthy without studying. For instance, Bill Gates mentioned this problem in his speech many years ago about how he felt regret when he expanded the wrong knowledge about studying in an unexpected way that he’s a billionaire, even dropping out of school.

In conclusion, some well-known people could affect children in an unexpected or expected way because of their wealth and lifestyle instead of their contributions in life. I strongly agree about this statement because the spreading of the Internet could follow with many potential risks like illegal drugs and wrong information from superstars.",3,5.0
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are controversial views about whether economic developments could address indigence and famine or harm the natural world. I believe national and local authorities should limit the growth business world, due to its pollution.

On the one hand, many advocates for the growth of the economy would solve hunger and poverty. In other words, cash crops and other modern business operations not only supply sufficient food for the ever-increasing population but also generate profit for the rich and create jobs for workers. By earning money, impoverished families might improve the standard of living and afford their children’s education. However, there are two drawbacks of this approach. Firstly, the profit generated from many industrial sectors benefit merely investors, not their employees and poor people. Secondly, the natural world is at the expense of the industrialisation and modernisation of humankind. For example, many lakes are now polluted because of the toxic waste discharged by factories.

On the other hand, while economic increase could be a stopgap measure for hunger and indigence, the environmental problems it causes must be recognised, so governments should introduce restrictions on numerous economic sectors. To be specific, the innovative industry is at the root of environmental degradation. In the last decade, governments and companies have sped their development rates and made a vast fortune, leading to more frequent and severe catastrophes, such as floods and droughts, which account for the starvation and poverty occurring in developing nations. Therefore, curbing modern businesses is a means of natural conservation.

In conclusion, although some individuals believe the answer to starvation and indigence would lie in the evolution of the economy, I would argue that this development results in environmental problems. As a result, the development of the economy must be limited.",11,9.0
Some people decided to have children in their late age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, with the development of many types of life such as urbanization, the development of industries, etc that makes people become busier and busier. They have to obey the circulation of life and their attitudes have to be changed to come up with their life. One of the significant changes is that more and more families tend to have children at a late age than in the past. This essay will discuss this phenomenon through various relevant examples to support it.

With regard to the merits, there are at least 2 advantages that can be observed when bearing children late. According to the decision, the couples can have much time to prepare and sort out their life before having some new members to the family. Before bearing a kid, they have to suffer from the calculation of the financial burden. They have to make sure about their abilities to take care of any kids in their home. Because of the issues, more and more couples believe they ought to stand in an ideal position before doing that great task. Last but not least, this is a period for the young families to enjoy themselves more. For example, with the exception of crowded outdoor life, that is the time for couples to enjoy together through many trips, picnic… and enjoy the feeling of the wonderful youth.

On the other hand, people have to suffer from no less than 2 main drawbacks belonging to this phenomenon. Initially, this can reduce the success rate of conception in women. Because each lady has a period of ideal ages to bear. The more ages they have, the more difficult they concept successfully. Secondly, this can restrict the number of offspring that can be born per family. When more and more families do not want to bear, this will affect the quality of the population chart and this will be a burden on the economy of any country. Finally, this phenomenon can lead to the lack of mental health of any offspring in the old parents compared to the young parents. When every people achieve a determined age, they wouldn’t have enough health and enthusiasm to experience new things. So, it’s a massive lack of children who have old daddy and mommy when they don’t have a trip to explore the new destinations or the bigger generation gap compared to the younger family.

The happiness of any parents is seeing the total growth of every child of them. To take this, every father and mother, let’s choose a suitable age to start making their own nuclear family, not too old but not too young, to bring an ideal environment for kids to grow and become a wonderful continuous generation in the future.",6,6.5
Many people use social media to keep in touch with other people and for news events. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, using social applications in order to communicate with others or update report events becomes widespread among people. While there are some drawbacks associated with using social media, I believe the main benefits are more substantial. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.

On the one hand, a primary advantage of using social media is that connections are made effortlessly regardless of the location or time. Hence, it helps many individuals who were immigrated to another country to make a connection with their relatives just by pressing a click. For example, it is so convenient for parents whose children study abroad to make a video call daily. In addition, due to the technological advancements in applications, various information is speared quickly, therefore, anyone can access the latest news. For instance, football fans are able to know the latest live football results on their way home.

On the other hand, a potential disadvantage of the existence of social media may be that each person would waste a lot of time on these social websites while it could be handled by time management. Also, people are maybe influenced by fake news published on such websites which provides some unreal content. For instance, teenagers are in danger of believing the fake lifestyle is presented by bloggers on Instagram. However, there is actually no evidence to support this view.

In conclusion, using social media would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, it is positive effects in terms of expanding their relationship and getting the up-to-date data is override the downsides.",9,8.0
"Some people are of the view that students should keep a gap of one year without study between school and university. While others think it affects learning.  
Discuss both viewpoints and give your opinion by giving relevant reasons and examples.","Actually, the new generations of students want to travel around the world between finishing school and begin the university.

On one side are a group of people who have the old idea, hard work all your life, and disagree the idea of rest and have a year of exploration and investigation new ways of work and live, finally they prioritize the money above all the other personal things.

By other side are the new generation parents, who support the new ways to conceive the future learning and how the young people want to gain their lives and get peace and happiness life, because they dont not have in first side the incomes.

Taking in account that both points of view, is very important the younger people opinion because in the end I believe these group are who take the most important decision for their future.

Is a fact when the school gaduates have a minimum a time of one year to think about the differents options, no only about the university diploma also many point of view in some cultures around the world thing like: religion, food, culture. That information represents the big first step to the freedom in their mindsets.

To conclude, all the things can do in the post-school year is the best way to improve degree choise and the successful professional future, all the new experiences and every knowledge what came in that year of travel or explore is invaluable.",0,<4
Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Universities are offering many online courses for the convinience of people. Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.
Prima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.
While remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.
In a nutshell though online education comes with some good feature but can never replace the physical/regular education system.",6,6.5
some people think the best way to solve global enviromental problems is to increase the cost of fuel to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Every country faces global environmental problems and they are very concerned about how to decrease those problems. Although, it is sometimes thought the best way to solve it to increase the cost of fuel. In my opinion, I considered that environmental issues can be solved in different manners.

There are several reasons to decline the matter of global environmental. The first and foremost important thing is that to ban the single-use of plastic. Plastic is a non-biodegradable item and it is very harmful to the environment. For instance, in one survey has conducted in the UK, 50% of environmental causes are happened by plastic. In addition, if government take a strict action against use of plastic such as plastic bottles, straws, carry bags and so on so,it is possible to reduce that problem.

Another point to consider to solve the environmental problem is to encourage people for more plantations. In big cities, more people are doing deforestations to build tall buildings and industries and it is also affects weather changes. For example, without trees it is very hard to keep the air clean and neat and people are getting a lack of rain. Hence, palnts and trees are the best way to stop that problems.

On the other hand, fuel is responsible for getting more issues in environment. nowadays persons prefer their own vehicles for transportations and this trend is booming. In addition, raising the cost of fule could be help to fall down the global warming.

In conclusion, numerous ways are available to solve the global environmental issues and government should encourage people to use  renewable things and try to solve them.",3,5.0
Some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"In this contemporary era, in several countries, knowing the history of the properties has been interesting for the owners. In my opinion, various reasons are affecting people to think about the past times. I am also convinced that they can enquire about these buildings from different resources. 

It is my view that what absorbs people is the sense of connection. To put it in another way, people find it intriguing to be knowledgeable in possessing’ history as they feel closer to that house. Moreover, not only does it enhance the connection with ancient people but also it enriches individuals’ curiosity. Therefore, numerous people have a personal interest in history and the history of their owners gives them an opportunity to fulfil this personal passion. For example, an ancient building in Kave Street was for one of the king’s ministers which resulted in a written book by its owner, owing to research and gaining information about that building and the past.

I further believe that people can augment their knowledge by enquiring about the elderly of that neighbourhood and the municipality plays a substantial role as well. In addition, some online websites can assist people in this field. For instance, the public can search for the roots of constructed palaces and their reasons on different websites. Although people should ensure that those sites are trustworthy, rarely does it happen that the government’s sites share wrong information.

To conclude, augmenting the connection with possess and their personal interest brings about research about the history of that building. From my perspective, the public can enquire from the elderly and use the municipalities’ websites to raise their awareness about the property.",6,6.5
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","It is argued that museums are better to become entertainment sites whilst others think that education should be the main aim of museums. For my perspective, both of distraction and education sides shoud be encouraged in museums.
On the one hand, museums should be play in the entertainment role for some reasons. Firstly, lots of people are likely to go somewhere in weekends to let their hair down after hard working days. They want to look for a transquil place to contemplate the beauty of life or artworks and museums are such appropriate sites. Secondly, museums are destinations for tourist attractions, where a country may advertise its regional or national culture or history. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the interacted activities or funny games into museum trips so that visitors do not feel boring and find it easy to remember the knowledge provided by the guides. 
On the other hand, museums should teach people about many aspect of life, such as history, science, art, culture and so on. Almost every city in one country possess at least one museum to serve local people and tourists. Hence, professional guides of museums have to either explain visitors whatever about the historical stories or origin of relics attached to locality or distribute to visitors pictures or audio documentary so that they understand well about details of one exhibition. Schools and colleges also usually organise museum trips where pupils or students are more eager to learn or verify the reality through visual sightseeings. 
In conclusion, it seems to me that learning from the practical observation and combined games is more interesting than tough theorical lessons. For that reason, museums should offer to visitors interesting recreation activities besides the education features.",4,5.5
"Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Many people have expressed that a number of reports detailing crime news should be controlled, as they have many negative effects on society. I partly agree with this view.

On the one hand, I believe the bad influences that stem from two main reasons. Firstly, the direct result of crime news with extremely details are to bring victims psychological injury. To pique readers’ interest, the media may use the bloody images and exaggerated language. This reminds me of a school murder that occurred in China.The local media had numerous reports on the atrocious detail of crimes. Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate. It not only to victim's mental health caused some damage, but also to the whole community to bring about a great potential threat. So the media should not report too many details of crimes to the public. 

On the other hand, the crime news can serve as a public warning. People can enhance their guarding consciousness in order to avoid becoming a victim, and also  assist the police in remaining alert. For example, the media report criminal news in a public place to arouse our social concern. The police can use this information to strengthen the force of supervision in this areas.

In conclusion, I argue that detail of crimes in the media are likely to invite various problems, and we should limit them to protect people from harm.",5,6.0
Films and computers games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is a popular trend that with the fast progress of the society, some violence plots are added into films and computer games. This situation heated a discussion, some people held conventional opinions that it has many bad influences, but an escalating category of people prefer to think it is harmless which I totally agree with. In the following essay, my contention will be further scrutinized.

To begin with, it is widely known that the forms of art change constantly in order to adapt the development of the era. This is because in the different specific time, the theme of the society is different which lead to different demands of people. Besides, art is the reflection of the characteristics of The Times. An eminent example of this is in the Renaissance era, many masters changed their painting or writing styles from praising the god and the church into celebrating the greatness of people such as Raphael and Michelangelo. Therefore, in the modern society, more and more informative technologies are invented and the fast pace of the life give people much more pressure than before. So watching some violence pictures can release stress and help people adapt to this fast-changing society.

However, as some conventional opinion say that too much violence is not good for people’s mental health. To illustrate this, in some occasions, if individuals who are obsessed with the those kinds of film or computer games are tend to have propensity for violence. This will contribute to more crimes and cause social instability. Moreover, without too much restrictions, teenagers can easily find the resources of the violent films and computer games. This will definitely influence their mental health due to the immature mind. Thus, it is important for managers to implement some measures and policies to partly limit people’s behavior especially set some limitations for the youth.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, I can reiterate that I believe that watching films and playing computer games which contain violence are trend of this society and can help people relax. But these behaviors must be under control, otherwise, there will be more crimes and bad influences on people’s mental health.",6,6.5
"While some people consider global warming to be the most pressing environmental problem now, others believe that deforestation has a more detrimental effect. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Presently, a sizable group believes that global warming is the most considerable issue, whereas, others argue that deforestation influenced more detrimentally to people's being. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of public opinion and give my own. Firstly, I will consider how global warming can be dangerous for coats regions. Secondly, I will explore the lack of oxygen due to cutting forests.

To begin with, swiftly developing societies and the industrial revolutions worldwide have impacted the emission and pollution of air, subsequently, it led to growing O2 in the stratosphere. Moreover, these contaminations from producing consumer goods are interconnected to slaying endangered kinds of animals and fertile ground, which is utilized by people as a way to manufacture food. For example, due to increasing temperatures around the world glaciers in Antarctica will melt by the next decade, thus, killing rare species that have specific habitats and inhabit cold climates such as either penguins or polar bears or fauna which live near the river will also be slayed by the melting.

On the other hand, plenty of consumer commodities required wood to be made, consequently, forests are being cut and utilized as a source by the timber companies. Furthermore, wood is producing one of the most vital resources such as air, therefore, deforestation can have devastating effects on our physical well-being and be caused exacerbation of sicknesses. For example, If an ill person has an innate disease such as asthma, deforestation will be worsening their health state so they can die.

In conclusion, in my opinion, both environmental issues should be solved by the cooperation of people and authorities worldwide because they are closely related to our being and health state.",8,7.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people have different views about looking for a future career. While some argue that getting a job after finishing high school is the best choice I believe that studying a higher education level is the better option. 
On the one hand, there are several reasons to support the idea of starting up a career right off the bat after school. The first one is that the young generation are able to earn a living  by themselves they are independent about finance, even they could support money for family at early stage. The second reason is that it is common knowledge that working at early age instead of studying higher education enables people to gain more experiences. This might be due to the fact that after a long time working with different jobs, youngsters would receive a host of lessons about life, therefore, it would beneficial for them if they want to have their own professional career in the future. 
Despite the above arguments, I maintain that higher education is a integral factor with regards to personal successful career in the future. Firstly, the choice of studying at University and College enables people to have a basic knowledge for the life ahead of them. People would gain a variety of good things to broaden their horizons by the lectures from school. Beside, they also have opportunities to build a relationship with open-minded people such as friends and professor, or learn a lot a lessons about your life from experts. Moreover, we are living in globalized world, higher education plays a vital role to help the youngsters to have a rewarding job. It is obviously that people get a university degree would have a decent job easily than people do not have. 
In conclusion, although it might be seen sensible for having a job on the spot after school. I personally prefer continuing studying higher education level.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? and how can people research this?","Being in possesion of some form of shelter is an essential aspect of life nowadays. With the growing population worldwide and many individuals occupying new buildings, it has become emperative to find out about the past of their new home. Therefore, this essay will tackle the reasons for the current trend as well as ways of conducting research about the past.

        Basically two reasons are behind this factor. Firstly,to avoid living in an old house that might require frequent renovations, people should find out about the age of a building and what it was intially used for. Take for instance, statistics show that if a house was built more than 20 years ago and is without any form of rehabilitation works, it is more likely to collapse due to its weak foundations. Hence reason for one to know about the history of a house. The second reason linked to the first is this, some homes were previously used for infamous activities which may have left a detestable veiw to many in the compound. For example, if a building was used for spiritistic rituals, many poeple would not want to have anything to do with it as they will always associate it with the olden days. Thus more reason to conduct some research to avoid inhabiting such a house.

        Gladly, though, researching about the past of a particular building can be beneficial to its owner. This can be done primarily in two ways. First, one should consult with the local government authorities regarding their know-how on the building being sought after. To illustrate, one can write to the local council asking them to help provide information about a house. This can help to sort out any doubts about how long the building has been in existence without renovation works. Finally, one can  research by conducting personal interviews with the people in the community. For instance, while conducting interviews, the owner of the building can inquire from the neighbours about what they know in relation to a building's previous use and how long it has been since it was last rehabilitated. In this way, one would avoid pit holes of regular renovations by acquring first hand data from the horse's mouth.

        In conclusion, because people want to avoid living in buildings that have never been renovated or that were used for spiritism, research is essential  and  can be done by inquring from the local authorities or neighbours.",5,6.0
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an hypothetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.

It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth is not so crucial for a rich country. People from countries such as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as funding for projects, well-organized cities,and  a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not feel a significant sense of satisfaction with the increase in their economy.

Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from countries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask for more funding for some start  up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money means more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museums and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obtain a lot of benefits.

To conclude, in this essay I discussed the general view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.",6,6.5
"most people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. why?
do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples,e.g from your knowledge or experience","Nowadays people prefer to have babies when they get old comparing to the past when people were having kids in an early age. In this essay I will look the reason behind this situation, and whether theirs cons outweighed to their drawbacks.

To begin with the reason I would say, our modern life make people busy to pursue their career. Instead of, building their own families, moreover the number of people who are not ready to have kids increase each and every day, for instance there is apartment in our neighborhood, 4 guys live there, and who have a good career path. However they are not ready for marriage. And, the old people in my neighborhood, they tell them every day, rather than living in solo you may live in classic way that we were use to live in our ages. But, they always reply, why we are rushing? We are still young.

Advantages of having children in late age is good in many sides, first it will decrease the divorce rate which leads that the children would not get enough care for separated parents. Second, when people worked all that time their finances could be good. So, they can mange needs of their children, because now everything is a double for their original price, while in the past decades live were easier. As result of that, preparation before being parent will be good.

Disadvantages are much more intense than advantages. Because. When people get old they cannot play, be friends for their children due to healthy issues. Nevertheless, the fertility rate of the person will be decline as the age increase and, leads to not having kids or it will be difficult. to illustrate, one day I was in the hospital I saw a woman, we talk like usually she was waiting her results from the laboratory, she gave me advice, she said marry at an early in order to have babies. Otherwise you will be like me I stand every day in front of hospital for hoping to increase my chance of pregnancy. 

In conclusion, not matter what condition that you want to push back. But, the consequence is worse.",3,5.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that day's teenagers always have free time, They spend their time on play video games, and movies or sleeping in they free time, but is the volunteering in charitable work  something good. The question is,do you think is that young youth can be benefit community as well? In the essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusions.

In terms of agree teenagers should to know a help with out opposite ,and this period is a age for giving in all of community's, The some a aldolescent stay and don't do anything, this negatively affects them and may be caused depression so charitable work helps to relax and feel satisfied.To begin, I accept that free time most spend it on a work and it is good to learn dealing with adults and knowledge good things and ideas,make friends as well, secondly, to develop a sense of responsibility and compassion for elders and the kids, following this the best volunteer is at a nursing home. The main reason given to supports this claim is that should not be an abstacle to studying. To illustrate, viral mercy and patience.

In conclusion, I believe that young people can benefit community as well, they can benefit a poor people and kids, in my opinion, the high schools

"some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? How can people research","It is true that today people are fond of finding more information about the past of their homes. Some reasons and solutions for this tendency will be addressed in this passage.

Regarding the reasons, the most important one is the knowledge of the history of the house or building helps the individuals to be more confident. In other words, the information regarding the basic parameters of a home plays a substantial role in the safety of our lives. For example, the age of an accommodation would be extremely helpful. Another reason why people are interested in finding out about their locations is that they will be able to decorate their homes beautifully. To be more precise, they can destroy the exceeded parts of their homes and build new ones. 

As for the solutions, the easiest approach for this would be the studying of related documents about their homes, as a result, they would be capable to fulfil their requirements, For instance, we wanted to purchase a house two weeks ago and we studied all needed documents and found out that its kitchen was perfectly spacious. Another suitable guidance would be to get enough data from the family who used to live there, this information is perfectly reliable.

In conclusion, there is a serious fact that the residents who are seeking the past of their accommodations, due to the fact that they need to get more assurance about the safety parameters and the possibility of the decoration changing. The documents and the prior residents can be counted as outstanding sources.",8,7.5
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Countries around the world rely on economic growth as it plays an integral part in its growth. While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.

On one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic wideninig, if improved, can lead to decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to this development for example, if a person gets quality education, this will align to the self development of that individual as well as contributes to the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacture goods, services, etc. As a  result of this it will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he/she from sufferings like poverty. Provided that the employment growth can be accelerated and this in turn safeguards people from not being able to meet their basic needs.",0,<4
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","No doubt, parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children. Since children are too young to understand what is right or wrong, it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in the right direction. Hence, I agree with the argument that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their minor children.

Children have impressionable minds. They acquire their values and morals from their parents. For instance, kids born in a good family often listen to good words and moral stories from the elderly family members. Therefore, when they find themselves in a difficult or unfavourable situation, they know how to keep their emotions in check and behave politely. This restraint that they learn from their family will prevent them from acting aggressively and getting into trouble.

By contrast, a child coming from a bad family may assimilate the bad qualities of their parents. Since they often get exposed to verbal and physical abuse they will assume that violence and aggression are normal and acceptable. It is only a matter of time before they commit crimes outside the home. For example, in India, the mother of a 14 year old boy was penalized for allowing her son to drive a four wheeler. The boy caused an accident and the judge who heard the case held his mother responsible because in his opinion, it was her duty to prevent her underage son from driving. Thus, obviously, parents are responsible for the actions of their children.

To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that the role of parents in raising law abiding citizens with social commitment is of utmost importance. Hence, I believe that parents should be held accountable for the wrong acts of their children.",9,8.0
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To

what extent do you agree or disagree?","Businesses are earning money but they also should follow social resposiblities. I completely agree that business people should have responsibilities towards society well-being.

Nowadays, most of the textile companies are making a lot of money. The bi-products generated by these companies are very harmful for humans so it is the duty of owners to reduce such waste and find a better solution for decomposing waste. For instance, one company situated in Bangalore produced a lot of textile waste which was dumped directly in river. The Government took quick actions and fined the company which led to lesser waste and clean river water. Protecting our environment should be the first most priority for any business companies. Thus, owner's should be held responsible for such things and strict actions should be taken by the government.

On the other hand, companies should not only focus on profit but also on the employees they have.

To deliver the deliverables on time companies are making the employee work day and night. This results in bad health of employees. The people should be treated nicely and work life balance should be maintained. For example, organizing fun activities should be encouraged at work place. It is said that if one keeps their employee's happy then the projects are delivered on time. If the business people are taking care of the folks around them then that company is considered as friendly. Hence, company should be socially responsible because it is beneficial to employee's and company itself.

In conclusion, I adhere that businesses should follow social responsibilities to keep their employees healthy and happy.",3,5.0
"In many countries, the government likes to spend more money on the arts. Some people agree with this. However, others think government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both sides and giver your opinion.","Providing affordable healthcare and education that can improve the quality of life is a priority for authorities. A country could invest money to offer health services that meet quality criteria. For instance, senior medical staff spends extra money to improve the quality of care and patient safety by reducing maternity and newborns mortality caused due to inadequate medication or unhygienic infrastructure. Administration in educational institutions consumes money to make it more accessible to a well-developed education system. That is to say, preparing a structured curriculum and hiring professional teachers contribute mainly to graduate skilled alumni for decent job opportunities. Thus, quality national health coverage and education boost public health and employability.


However, education and health are not more crucial than the arts. Art illustrates great importance in self-expression and fulfillment. In other words, art is the same as the language in describing imagination and ideas. Painting, sculpture, music, and literature are mediums that an artist chooses for his craft to convert his feelings and thoughts into tangible objects people can see and touch. Moreover, art is a form of presenting culture. When tourists visualize paintings made in caves and rocks by ancient people, they can develop a deeper understanding of ancestors' lifestyle and language evolution throughout time and space. It is; therefore, communication and culture are just two forms of art.",0,<4
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that many individuals believe that reading the news in the press and watching it on television wastes too much time as it does not relate to any aspects of their lives. Personally, I partly agree with this view due to some reasons.

On the one hand, It is considered to be a waste of time  to catch the news through the newspaper or social media as the appearance of numerous fake news every day. This happens because there are some content creators nowadays who make themselves well-known by posting untrue stories online. This leads to the problem that people involved in the stories somehow are not only misunderstood but also misjudged by the readers. For example, a few famous artists in Viet Nam were said to pass away after a long time suffering from cancer, while they are actually fine. 

On the other hand, reading or watching the news is suggested as the best way to keep up with the latest information about things happening around the world. People living far away need the news to catch up with what is occurring in their hometown or country. Besides, news can help us to improve our general knowledge as well. For instance, about 3 years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, everyone had to be isolated from each other and therefore, getting news on some online basis or on TV was the most efficient way to get information about what we had to do to prevent the disease. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that the news has both positive and negative extents. It is necessary for readers to choose the source of news carefully in order to get accurate information.",4,5.5
"Some people think that robots are very important for human’s future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effect on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the dramatic technological innovation, robots are widely used in all aspects in the world. In this case, an argument - whether robots are positive or negative - exists. In the following contents, two opinions will be analyzed and the evaluation will be presented. 

The advantage of this phenomenon is obvious: the increase of profitability. For firms, the usage of robots can decrease the variable costs since there is no need for robots to offer salaries and insurances. Consequently, the marginal cost of each product declines significantly, which enables producers to obtain more profits. For instance, Hongqi, a vehicle manufacturer, successfully reduced its total costs for over 30% in 2020 by hiring robots with AI technology that took over about half of its workers. 

However, it also creates issues. When robots are used, to reduce costs - as what has been mentioned above - companies prefer robots instead of human employees; thus, structural unemployment exists since people are taken over. This leads to various problems in both economy and society. First, when the massive unemployment occurs, a lot of people lose sources of wages, which, in a macro perspection, leads to the larger Gini Index caused by the income distribution inequality. Moreover, since individuals have no money, the only way for them to survive is becoming criminals. Therefore, the crime rate is also going to rise in an unexpected way. 

In conclusion, it is doubtless that the application of robots can provide firms with larger profit, while it also brings numerous unemployment rate which leads to further inequality and crime rate. Hence, benefits and limitations exist simutaneously. Robots can be used, but in a controlled and proper way such as the combination of both mankind and auto employees.",2,4.5
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","When thinking about whether their children should be taught by teachers at school or educated themselves at home, most parents probably fall somewhere into two extremes. On the one side is the approach taken by most ordinary parents, who have made great endeavours to send their children to the most prominent schools.  

On the other is the view expressed by an increasing number of writers, film stars and artists that the normal education system is unsuitable for their children and its necessity and value are yet to be confirmed. From my perspective, parental education itself could not take the place of school.   

It is widely admitted that some parents are already the best teachers in certain areas, such as music, painting, writing and vice versa. For those parents, they tend to find what the normal school taught is useless and even harmful to their children's development. However, they overlook two facts. 

For one thing, besides being a place for learning, school also functions as a communication center where various views and comments are equally expressed and exchanged, which parents could not easily replace. After all, an artist or a writer that has already made prominent contributions to one area is more likely to be biased when it comes to opposite voices unless they do not have faith in what they are working on. Nevertheless, a child needs to weigh in diversified facts in their perspective rather than replicate what their parents think.   

For another, children could also benefit from school life even if nothing was learned. At school, peers gather together and they gradually learn to cooperate and communicate efficiently with each other. Furthermore, witnessing children with different personality or even from various cultures, they figure out the importance of embracing differences and finally the colorful world.   

All in all, missing the opportunity of school results in loss of diversity and failure to acquire interpersonal skills. Hence, its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.",4,5.5
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, the production of consumer goods results in more and more harmful to the environment than ever. This damage is due to the high levels of consumption and the use of certain kinds of energy, such as petroleum and coal.

In the modern world, people are induced, by advertisements, to buy things that they do not need. Actually, we buy more products than  it is really necessary to survive or get a comfortable life. This behaviour generates high demand for some types of products like mobile phones, cars, clothes, and electronic gadgets, for example, which generate high levels of garbage, when it is disposable. Moreover, the production of these goods results in several damage to nature because they need huge amounts of energy. Quite often, this energy is generated by sources which increase the pollution and contamination of rivers, oceans, and air. As a result, this pollution can kill many species of plants and animals.

To solve this problem, the government and public authorities worldwide should control and restrict the use of some sorts of energy, stimulating the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and biofuel. Furthermore, all  nations should make stricter laws and inspect  compliance, applying fines to the companies and countries that fail to comply. Another action that could be done, is to promote the reusable of products and changes in consumption patterns.

In conclusion, the production of consumer goods at elevated levels is very harmful to life on the planet. Several actions can be taken to avoid or at least minimize this problem, especially changing the standard of consumption and choosing new sources of energy.",7,7.0

On the one hand,increasing capabilities of robots in functioning complex tasks will eventually eliminate some human jobs.Many companies and industries are replacing their workers by robots to save money and time.This ascendancy of robots in performing different fields of job will affect many people financially and mentally.As robots also depend on human programming,it can be dangerous for any mistaken or in unexpected circumstances.Foe example,in USA it is revealed that driveless cars can not make good judgments in their surrounding and they involve in many tragic accidents.However,I believe that robots are essential in humans future advances,because they can handle strenuous and unsafe jobs.

In the other hand,it is taught that because robots are automated they are important in the accomplishment of unchangeable tasks and they are also viable in dangerous areas.Androids have the ability of lifting heavy loads and in the manufacturing,assembling,packing,and packaging of items precisely,Which cab be very exertion.tough and boring jobs for human being.The artificial intelligence of this machines in doing things perfectly on time allows people to save time and spend it on jobs and other different activities that require full concentration.Robots can also perform effective results in harmfull situations.They used to detect dispose harmful materials for human health in industries.For example,they can be used to inspect chemical factories where radiation,toxic chemicals or explosive gases pose significant risks to human employers.I believe that,robots are necessary for future development because workers can save time and are able to manage and maintain efforts to acquire new knowledges and skills,they also help employees to stay safe in the processing of risky chemicals.

Model Answer:","The diagram shows the design for a wind turbine and its location. It is observing that machine consists of four parts, which are connected between them. Altogether, have main role of energy producing, by following all process needed to obtain it. 

A wind turbine looks like a huge fan.  This resemblance is caused whereas, it is formed of high steel tower, and blades which are made of fibreglass or wood. Also, the machine has generator and a wind sensor. This design makes that the turbine can achieve the natural energy and at the same time does not spoil the landscape. 

The diagram illustrates how the machine works. The process starts when the wave goes to blades, then the sensor determines the speed and direction of wave, the wave is generated and afterword the energy is produced. 

The wind turbine can be located at different places. It is seen that the turbine can be located at straight land, in water, near home by seaside and on high point of hill. The one situated near home was named as domestic turbine, but another situated on the open spice territory has a small building near by and are checked by a computer. In comparison, it is shows that the optimum location of the machine is at the top of hill, by seaside and in the water, because there is generated maximum of wind strengths.

Discuss both sides and giver your opinion.","Whereas some argue that it is right that the government spends a lot of money on the arts, others claim that the government should invest more on health and education. In my opinion, although arts are relevant for society, spending on health and educations is more important.

First of all, the arts are relevant for a country, since they can bring awareness about society's issues. Thus, it is part of a government duty investing in music and video production among other types of arts. For example, an inequality of opportunities for people coming from suburban areas can be expressed by the music produced by authors which are living in that region. Consequently, the government investing on several kinds of arts is a way of allowing people to express their reality. 

On the other hand, health and education are essential blocks for a country's wealth. Hence, both a good health care system and high quality education need to be a priority for government spending. For instance, it is preferable investing in hospitals, schools, and universities instead of investing on other topics, such as either music or video production. Therefore, since health and education are fundamental for a society they need to come first when talking about public investments.

In conclusion, even though the arts are important for expressing different society's realities, a proper medical care system and quality education are core necessities for a country. Then, I believe that the government should invest more on health and education than on the arts.",9,8.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Learning about the background of properties like houses are getting increasingly popular in some parts of the world. It seems in this process they can find surprising facts that can affect the value of the house or  either attract some amount of attention. To do so it is advised to reach reliable sources such as city councils or former owners.

First and foremost, exploring the history of the building might result in, possible well_worthy unexpected information, which can vary in a variety of aspects.firstly the house might be a unique design by a famous architecture, forgotten through years, with valuable features. In this case, that place must be resorted or maintained carefully. In recent years, similar cases of houses as mentioned above, in historic cities of Iran such as Yazd, have been founded in further studies. Secondly, there might be slightly a chance that the building had belonged to a well-known figure which can benefit by bringing the attention of the current owner. Overall a search in the background of a building  can add more profit to the value of the house so it makes sense to attempt such effort.

In my view,  people should look for the records of their houses, through existing files stored, at city councils for the obvious reason of accuracy. Also, any possible trace of former owners is filed in these offices as  they can provide valid information related to the property. So these documents are the primary data source for the search.

"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are extremely argumentative statements heating up a debate over whether people should learn more about their family in the past or put more concentration on their current and future generations. While some claim that it is essential to know about family history, others make a strong view that present and future generations should be taken into great consideration. I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned ideas. 

Without a shadow of a doubt, I think that understanding family history is extremely imperative to each person, it can bring numerous benefits. One of those is that they can have more assistance in their society from many other relatives. In other words, when we research our family trees, we can have contact with more relations that we have not ever known before. By doing so, we can get more help from them in a place far from home. For example, if you are a student and you want to study in foreign lands, such as France, Germany and so forth, you should know about your relatives in those lands in order that you can get numerous useful help during your learning journeys. Thus, I believe that perceiving our own family backgrounds is significantly important because we can have support from our unknown relations when we need.   

While the importance of learning family trees is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of concentrating on present and later generations is ignored. Focusing on guiding the present and forthcoming generations can make our society better. To be particular, when we focus on educating our descendants, they can become a quality workforce in the future, which can contribute to social development. For example, Vietnamese people always try numerous ways to fully improve their successors, which make Vietnam become one of the fastest developing countries in Asia now. Hence, putting attention on the current and upcoming generations is significantly crucial for community improvement.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that both studying our family in the past and concentrating on educating our current and upcoming generations are equally significant in different aspects. Therefore, from my perspective, it is vital that we not only research our family trees but also give existing and next generations great priority.",6,6.5

Even, there is still a large number of people, including me, believing that issues can be tackled with effective actions. The awareness of protecting environment and wild animals has been raised in recent decades. Some governments has made strict laws to regulate people’s behavior, for example, over hunting wild animals or trading their body parts to the black market . Also, advertisements of advocating eco-friendly tourism can be found everywhere. People are more willing to changing their lifestyle by using public transportation like the metro and railway instead of driving only.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","There is a growing trend whereby residents are researching the history of their homes. This is due to a natural curiosity and practical concerns and should be done through official channels.

Many are interested in the past of their home because they desire to link with history and are worried about potential structural faults. The first reason is analogous to exhaustively studying family genealogy. By researching one’s ancestors or place of residence, it is possible to understand and establish a connection with the past. Moreover, there is a pragmatic reason related to historic construction methods. Older homes, in particular, may have employed unsafe techniques or materials that will degrade, creating the risk of structural damage and, in the worst cases, collapses. By learning about the house and the period when it was built, residents can take the necessary steps to ensure the house is structurally sound.

The method for carrying out such specialized research involves requesting local records. It is possible to do initial research through “word of mouth” and collecting relevant stories in a community. However, this information may be unreliable, and therefore an individual should endeavour to contact their local building authorities. In most countries, it is possible to register  freedom of information requests and receive the required documents from municipal offices. Governments have little incentive to protect such information and are likely to be receptive and helpful in offering assistance. Residents can then be assured they have the most trustworthy information possible in order to better understand the history of their home and any possible defects in its construction.

To conclude, some today gather information concerning the history of their home to understand the past and guarantee their safety. This development is advisable and the authorities should comply and encourage such fact-finding.",9,8.0

Even if you forgot asking any such questions in the begining, when planning to sell the property people frequently ask about previous history of the house and all the residents ever lived in it. This could be because of the curiosity. Whether a prominent person had ever shared the place or it could be a anxiousness driven by fear; if any mishappening had occured at the place.

When purchasing or selling a house, history of all previous owners is of profound interest. Feeling like curiosity or fear drive such a question. For instance, whether a crime had ever happened at the house or in the building, or any illegal activity was performed the the residence. Also curiosity to know if a famous person had lived in that place. Such questions will impact the sale of the property and  it can go either ways, based on the history of type of people lived there.

To gain knowledge on such a topic, a realtor is the first best person to ask before buying the place. And later, neighbours are the one who could help you out discoverying the facts and the history of the house. If you are still not satisfied, you can approach the government body dealing in the housing management. They have all the records of all the previous owners. Or if you are living in a building, there must be a management company. Ask them any reasonable question regarding the past of that building.

Firstly, we will discuss positive aspect of this trend. To commence with, parents think it is a good habit to give children a small amount of money on regular basis. They will understand value for money and turn into more responsible citizens . Moreover, they would also been exposed to situations where they have to save fortnight’s money to buy something essential. For example, if they want to buy new version of video games, they should save from their pocket money and spend that money to buy the desire product.
On the flipside, the penny allotted at such small age could deteriorate their life . Chances of involving into wrong doings are on higher side with other friends. So, until child gets matured and understand the ins and outs of life, even a single penny can drift him away from his academic paths. Instead, they should be given money to participate in co curricular activities or other sports and events.
To conclude,  parents play an important role in children’s life. Parents should keep a strict watch where their children are spending their pocket money. After analysing both the aspects, I am of the opinion that children should be given little amount of money occasionally. They should learn how to save and use hard earned money. It is important to teach them financial management in early years of their life.",3,5.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children are considered the future of tomorrow; therefore, their upbringing plays a vital role in their development and nourishment. Teamwork is supposed to provide a broad spectrum of ideas, creativity, and connectivity. In my opinion, such activities of collaboration and connection in various segments of life should be encouraged owing to their optimum benefits.

Firstly, extra curriculum activities are exercised in academics to show off the hidden abilities and to encourage the talent of little ones. Events and sports galas are organized to enhance cooperation and relationships amongst students. 

Moreover, teamwork promotes harmony and tends to utilize the full potential of individuals through various tasks. Sports are means of working together, incorporating different schools of thought to achieve specific goals. The capability and individual endurance are challenged when someone works in a cross-cultural or multi-cultural team to bring the best out of it. 

Nevertheless, such platforms are aimed to polish the particular abilities of individuals. Leadership, working in different teams under various circumstances, how to manage complex situations. All these elements are very fruitful in their practical life. Furthermore, our children are the future of tomorrow and ultimately will lead the nations and their communities. The habits developed at this stage will decide their fate shortly since leadership development, weaknesses, and leadership qualities are identified and are aimed to further work on them. Such hobbies are also a great source of self-development and learning from the experience of others. 

In conclusion, taking into consideration future aspects, children should be highly encouraged to take part in such learning platforms to train themselves and nourish their talent. The abilities and capabilities developed in the initial stages have a long effect on their practical life and professional career.",5,6.0
"Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school have wasted their time. Other people argue that everything children study at school is useful at some time.


Discuss both view and give your own opinion.","Children’s education issue is always (hotly discussed by/the focal point of) parents and educators, trying to explore an optimum method. Some people think that it is a waste of time for children to learn many things and the other side assert that whatever they study, it will be useful at some time. Arguments can be made up for both sides and I think all children should learn various subjects which seem useless now and it is necessary to purposely develop their hobbies or specialties.

Some claim children learning many different subjects is a waste of time because what they learn cannot be used when earning a living in society. For example, arts and music lessons are often available often indispensable 自相矛盾in schools. However, some parents think children cannot get practical skills that benefit them to get a job and make a living by learning these lessons. Additionally, some think these courses are useless because they do not plan for kids to be an artist. As a result, these parents insist that children should be educated on more subjects which can benefit their future work career.

On the other hand, some people argue that what children study in school will make a difference at some time in the future, which is just it is merely not visible or immediately useful right now. For instance, still art classes that seem useless will cultivate the aesthetic ability of children, helping them find and feel beauty during daily life, which can lead them to be happy whether they want to be artists or not. Mental Happiness of mental is significant, which is even more important than getting a job because poor mental health can lead to deterioration of is also a part of physical health. What's the point of talking about work without good health?

In summary, various curriculum arrangements are reasonable because these courses are beneficial to students’ growth, only sometimes the benefits are not immediately obvious invisible. As far as I am concerned, setting these lessons is also an effective approach for everyone to get an overview of different fields. Students can choose what they really like by these initiations to improve them as their own hobbies or specialties and educators can teach children according to their different talents and abilities.",7,7.0
The only way to improve safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Road safety is major topic of concern in today’s society. Although I accept that punishing those who violate traffic laws severely is an important means of protecting road users, I contend that this is not the only way, as there are several other solutions to implement.

Imposing stringent punishments on traffic lawbreakers is undoubtedly an effective method of guaranteeing road safety. This is because this may deter drivers from disobeying traffic regulations. If there are fewer drivers flouting traffic laws, the roads may become safer for all road users. This can be seen in the situation of Hanoi in early 2012, when a new fine for running the red light or overtaking without giving the left turn signal was introduced. As a result of this heavy fine, both the traffic accident and the traffic-related mortality rates in Hanoi fell considerably in that year.

I would, however, claim that it is an exaggeration to state that the aforementioned policy is the only viable way of keeping drivers safe, and there are other resolutions to adopt. The first is constructing designated lanes for different types of vehicles, namely cars, motorbikes and bicycles. This measure is crucial in many cities in the world such as Jakarta and Bangkok, where most fatal traffic accidents happen when cars and motorbikes collide. The second is enhancing the safety standards of all vehicles on the road, which can be done by setting higher criteria for examining the safety of these vehicles before issuing number plates for them. Cars, for example, should be legally required to be equipped with at least four air bags and an anti-lock braking system.

To conclude, while I agree that punishing driving offenders can help improve road safety, I am firmly of the opinion that there are many other ways of ensuring safety for drivers, including building dedicated lanes for different kinds of road vehicles and raising the safety standards of these vehicles. I recommend that all these measures should be adopted simultaneously in order that drivers can enjoy the safest driving experience.

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do advantages of this trend outweigh disadvantages?","In modern society, there has been a major concern that many couples have delayed parenthood. In my opinion, I consider that parents decision to give birth in later stage of life can bring about more advantages for family when compared to minor drawbacks that it might bring.

Despite the drawbacks mentioned below, I believe the benefits gained by the late childbirth are extremely useful for the whole family. The primary reason why a number of individual want have children later in their life is that this choice allow them to have more time to find their passion and enjoy life when they are young. For instance, it is easier for a young couple to travel when they do not have baby to nurture. An additional reason is that people who are at early stage of their career usually have lower income compare to when they are older. Therefore, many people decide to start raising a family after having accumulated enough money to ensure a better life for their children.

Admittedly, there are some issues involved when people want to have children in their middle age.one problem is that it has some detrimental effects on the society, this tendency might affect family life as having children later will cause significant age gap between two generations. This makes it harder for parents to understand and communicate with their offspring. Another negative aspect is that if people give birth when they are too old, the babies being born might be physically less healthy.  This might adversely affect the quality of the future workforce if too many people decide to follow this trend.

In conclusion, although tourists can have certain negative effects, it has an extremely positive influence on the economy as parents prefer having children later in life because they want to improve their career and enjoy their social life.",4,5.5
"Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the technology is improving, more people are seeing to become reliable to the computers
What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers..",6,6.5
people believe that teeagers should be require to do unpaid community work in therefore in their time this can benefit teenager and the community as well. To what extant do you agree or disagree.,"Teenagers are the future of the world.On the other hand,they are young and energetic and to utilise them in social work is a very  good idea indeed.But,at the same time,we have to consider what aspect we can give them by offering unpaid social tasks? In my essay,I shall enlighten  the benefits of their works  and I totally agree that they can bring some good changes to the neighbourhood through their services.

Firstly, the young generation can do some free teaching services to the poor ,needy children.These will help  to develop some leading capacity among themselves as well as ,it will bring some development in literacy sector .On the other hand, arranging some sports competition and cultural functions can be done by the young generation, which will encourage society to be healthy and entertained.For instance ,last year the annual game in our area was arranged by some young boys and girls,was so entertaining.The  residents were so excited about it .And surprisingly ,after the programme ,the morning exercise and evening walk participants  increased  significantly.

However,nowadays  teenagers are busy with their study and exams.and above all,some of them like to pass their time in binge-watching.So,it is definitely a very good step for them if  they are interested to give a hand in social work though it is unpaid.But good work is always precious.Like a smile on children's face when they are participating in athletics or activities cannot be measure in money.It is immensely valuable.

To conclude,if  teenagers give their valuable time to the community,their morality will improve and they will learn a lot of good things about life and behaviour.On the whole ,the positive sides of doing so will surely outnumber the disadvantages.",9,8.0
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent  on each other, while others think that people have become more  independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about whether we are more or less  dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be  more independent than people were in the past.  There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more  dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult,  especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For  example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying  a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would  be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage.  Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want  a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents  usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from  grandparents and babysitters for child care.  However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more  independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming  smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on  relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel  and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students  choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this  experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone.  Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows  us to work alone and from any part of the world.  In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now  depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more  independent than ever.",4,5.5
Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental pollution has been a major concern in recent years. The main reason of the air pollution is caused by the combustion of fossil fuel, some people think that government should raise the price of fuel to resolve this issue. In my opinion, it may help to some extent; however, this is not the only way to tackle this issue.

On the one hand, increasing the price of petrol can help to reduce the environmental pollution to some degree. The excessive use of cars releases carbon dioxide into atmosphere which is detrimental to earth. If the price of petrol hiked, individuals would probably start to drive less often and this in turn can decelerate the rate of air pollution. However, the increase in the cost of petrol would not stop the environmental pollution. Besides, the fuel price determined the market price of essential commodities, and increasing price can affect poor and middle class.

On the other hand, government can take other measure to mitigate these problems. A better solution is to invest in renewable energy such as solar, wind and tide rather than unrenewable energy like petrol and coal. For example, solar power in the United States has proven its efficiency in energy production.Second, by improving public transport and reducing the cost of traveling, the government can ecourage people to take the transportation; this practice can help clean the environment and reduce traffic.

To conclude, I strongly believe that the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem. Improving the efficiency in public transportaiton and investing in renewable resources is better alternatives that ought to be considered.",5,6.0
"Figures show that in some countries, there is an ever-increasing proportion of population aged 15 or younger. What do you think are the current and future effect on those countries?","Nowadays in many countries, the proportion of youngsters, aged under 16, to total population undergoes an upward trend. This phenomenon would bring prominent impacts to those countries, both in short term and in long term. 

The great proportion of young people will aggravate the burden of nurture in short term. More children could make the burden of education much heavier and could negatively affect the living standard of families currently. To rise more kids, parents have to work harder to earn more and devote budgets, which would be spent on consuming food and beverage, to children’s care and education. Additionally, the government would also spend more financial resources on constructing more schools and hospitals to cater the growth of youngsters, which could result in imbalanced development of different sectors of economy and society. Moreover, teachers’ workloads would be overwhelming since teachers have to take care more students now than before. 

On the other hand, the increasing percentage of teens will bring several benefits to the whole society in long term. Teens will become suitable candidates for the job market when they become adults, which provide more workforces to the industries. Great workforces would generate abundant outputs and boost growth of economy. Moreover, the number of innovations and inventions could be enlarged when more kids grow up and well-educated, since great proportion of teens means great probability of emergence of experts and innovators. 

However, the increasing percentage of teens might cause troubles to the eco-system in long term. As population growth, the amount of natural resources consumed and the amount of waste generated would be increased. Therefore, the environment may face serious threat of contamination. 

To sum up, the growth of teen population would bring significant impacts to those countries, both in positive and negative sides.",1,4.0
"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","It is indisputable that the advent of technology, especially robots, plays an vital role in modern life. Authorities say that it is possible that artifical intelligence could take over human tasks in the coming decade. Despite this replacement seems to be a good idea, it also has its drawbacks. I am going to give my opinions below.

It is appearent that the birth of robots has great contrtibutions to financial plans of governments. In the field of manufacturing, robots could potentially reduce labour costs in the long run, as they do not require salaries, benefits, or other ongoing expenses associated with human employees. Although there are maintanance costs, they can be offset by increased productivity and reduced human workforce requirements. Addition to this, the product quality would be under control thanks to robots. They could consistently perform tasks with high precision and accuracy during manufacturing processes. Moreover, artifical intelligence entities could minimize errors, reduce variability, and enhance product consistency, resulting in higher-quality products. In the future, I believe, robots will have more significant contributions to other aspects of society. 

On the other hand, the appearence of robots does have its negative influences on employees. One of the major concern is that the widespread use of robots may lead to considerable job losses for humans. They take over tasks previously performed by humans, as a result, unemployment rates may rise, causing socio-economic challenges and income inequality. Despite advancements in robotics, there are still limitations and risks to consider. Robots may encounter difficulties when facing complex, unpredictable situations which require adaptability, flexibility and decision-making. 

In conclusion, it is important to notice that the impact of robots on the job market and society is a complex and multifaceted issue. People need to consider both advantages and potential drawbacks of robot replacing human jobs to ensure a sustainable and inclusive future of work.Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.",1,4.0
Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some individual assume that studying in college or academy is one of the best routes to build up a successful career while others think the undergraduate needs to indulge in employment after finishing their school. This essay will discuss both views and give evidence further education is mandatory after schooling  life. 

In the one hand, some individual thinks the undergraduate should find out the task and involved in work after their institution course. This might be because they want to indulge the junior to the real world and makes them familiar about the world reality. For instance, the children when finishing  school education and involved in the effort they will meet with a diverse range of public living around them. Moreover, they have to mitigate their problem by themselves Which assist them to  build up  personal skills like socialisation, confident, problem-solving art and so on. That way the population might think learner after completing their learning at school so go for the job rather than going educational institution for further course.

However, some public  might be able to the opposite of this. The first and foremost reason is they believe they are not prepared enough to procrastinate their trial at the teenager after completing their academy life. Also, the mind is not fully developed to decide what is wrong and what is right? Furthermore, the mighty  involved in crime or drug  if they don't do further class and just worried about  employment. For example,  recent research concluded that 90% the learner are not prepared to take the right decision at their age as their mind is not fully developed to comprehend the right decision. So, In my opinion, if they do further study they will get the opportunity to build up their mind and proficiency like computer expertise, communication competence, team leader savvy, creativity and thinking capacity will be build which is significantly important for this competitive world. Thus, the junior  should join college or university for their further study after academy rather than focusing on job searching. 

To conclude, although some society assumes pupil should do the effort and earn money after their school life, in my view education is more important than money in their age and they are not fully developed so they should focus on their class and should join university or college to develop their personal skills.",9,8.0
Some people claim that many things children learn at school have actually wasted their time. Other people argue that everything taught at school is useful in the future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Whether all of things taught by teachers at school is valuable or not  is a controversial issue. In my opinion, most of knowledge which students acquire in their academic career is beneficial to them.                                                       

The argument that many knowledge taught by teachers are useless is plausible. There is no denying that some courses have little practical value. For example, elementary politics and history are two compulsory courses during learning at school, but some  students think  these knowledge are so boring that they do not focus on them. Furthermore , these students are less likely to know how to  apply them. Another evidence to support the argument is that students must learn some basic lessons such as math , foreign language and computer technology. Although these things are important for students' career in the future, students do not need to learn them deeply and systematically.  In other words , it is enough for children to  attain nearly intermediate level in terms of general knowledge. To be specific,  there is no need that most of students learn calcus, liner algebra in the university.

However, some people think that  all kinds of things learning at school are valuable. This statement is right to some extent. Firstly, the school is a place where people get necessary knowledge qualified for their jobs. If a person want to be a entrepreneur , he need to take a MBA program or something relevant to management and corporate finance. Secondly, students can be moral and distinguish right from wrong through some  relevant compulsory courses. It is obvious that this statement exaggerate the fact. Not anything learned at school  can students benefit from.                                         

 In conclusion, people can learn ethics and necessary skills for work when they are students. However, some courses are lack of practice and less necessary.",3,5.0

While others assume that it is preferred to be employed after leaving high school. This essay attempts to discuss both views and provide my perspective which is finishing university or college is more beneficial.

On the one hand, there is an attractive option for having an occupation as soon as leaving school is soft capabilities achievement. Because of employing in a new environment, students have opportunities to contact many kinds of people and characters which are partly different from the educational environment. This act helps young individuals develop their potential, not only working skills but also soft skills such as public speaking, negotiation and so on. For example, students from HV Academy always have the highest rate of acceptance. 

On the other hand, I completely believe that it is much more beneficial for students to have university or college degrees by accomplishing higher schooling due to better job choices and higher income. Firstly, because of the harsh competition in the market, loads of applications for one business are submitted every single day. Once students own a degree from a university or college, those students’ applications will be attracted noticeably by the hiring manager, which increases the possibility of acceptance. For instance,.

 In conclusion, in spite of the advantages of starting work early, I still believe that being employed after graduating from higher education is more beneficial due to its benefits.",9,8.0
"Nowadays human activities have had negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem while others argue that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. 
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In recent centuries, plant and animal species have been impacted by human activities and become extinct, so some people claim that the situation has been too severe that nothing can be done to save the disappearing species, while others argue that we still have methods to preserve the ecosystem. In my opinion, although the ecosystem has been damaged badly, human beings still have a chance to protect the whole environment of the earth. 

First, existing species can be saved and the environmental pollution has been controlled by the efforts of the ministry of most countries and the public. Governments have made agreements and signed pacts to cooperate to solve the pollution problems. Meanwhile, People have set up organizations to promote and practice environmental protection in societies. For example, in Africa, lions have been protected by environmentalists and local authorities who stop illegal hunting. Public and governments are taking actions to reduce or even eliminate the human’s negative impact on nature. 

On the other hand, industrialization and resource consumption still put high pressure on the environment. Increasing industry and energy burning keep producing a large number of pollutants every day which is breaking the ecosystem. For instance, an increasing amount of CO2 is being released into the air which makes global warming worse. Another example is that some countries export lumber to earn money which leads to continuous deforestation that accounts for species extinction every day. Therefore, there are still so many things that need to be done to protect our blue planet. 

In conclusion, the public and governments are taking action and achieving some success in preserving nature and species, while the situation is still severe so all humans should work together to save our earth.",9,8.0
"Some people think in order to continually improve the quality of education, high school students  should be encouraged to evaluate and criticize their teachers. Others feel that this would result in a  loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion..","They say that Learning never stops. We learn till our last breath and it is actually responsible to  improve our character, It defines what kind of human being we would be. And now we can see  there’s lot of improvement in learning experience. We have seen evolution from Nature classroom  to Google classrooms. Electronic classes where children sit at their home and learn various things  where teaches plays vital role. It has been revolution at every stage in this process and now students  are encourage to evaluate and criticize their teachers, while others feel that it can disturb the  discipline in the classroom.  Teachers are considered to be another parents who gives valuable lessons to child. There has been a  time when all mistakes of teachers were acceptable and unquestionable where teachers were  considered to be dictator and students were following the instructions given by their mentor.  Nowdays this process has been changed drastically and now students has liberty to judge their  teachers and give them feedback which in my perception should be limited at some extent because  there are number of mischievous children in the classroom who can portray wrong image of the  authority and can disturb the environment of study.  In my opinion there should be transparency in the process where we can validate the on going  process like cameras or recordings. In this way authorities can track their own performance and  make changes rather than giving power to developing minds. Also we can practice gaining feedback  from students with limited resources like google feedback forms.  To conclude would like to say both aspects are beneficial if one is true to himself/herself in order to  judge an experienced person and authorities should limit with boundaries for power they are  providing to students.",1,4.0
"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","Owing to the different physical and mental abilities of men and women, it is often argued by some people that different genders are best suited for different jobs. I completely agree with this statement and will discuss it further.

First and foremost, as physical abilities of both sexes are different, where men are considered to be dominant in that area and women more fragile, jobs involving more physical activities, such as lifting of heavy bodies, are best suited for men. For instance, men are expected to join the armed forces and military jobs because it involves a great amount of physical work and living in secluded places for a long time, which might be a difficult task for women as women are comparatively supple mentally and physically.

Secondly, it is evident that the women are better suited for creative works such as artists and literature professors or teachers. Hence, more ratio of girls is more inclined towards studying art subjects than boys. As it is a psychologically proven fact that the part of a human brain, which controls a person’s artistic behaviour is stronger in women than men, this choice is expected. For example, 65% of the artists in the world are women, while men are just 35%.

In conclusion, as men and women's bodies and brains are made differently to work in different situations, I firmly agree with the argument that they are better suited for different kinds of jobs. Therefore, men are suited for jobs involving heavy power work and women innovative and artistic jobs.",10,8.5
"Task 2: Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In recent years, some individuals believe that international cooperation mainly brings advantages for  the environment while others argue that more benefits are brought to the world business. In this essay, I would like to discuss both of these perspectives before drawing a reasoned conclusion. 

On the one hand, cooperation among countries could have advantages impacts on the environment. Firstly, the environment has become increasingly polluted by green-house effects and global warming. This issue is impossible to be solved by only one individual or one country as cooperation among religion will bring more ideas and solutions to help protect the environment. For example, scientists and environmentalists could research and invest in clean energy like solar, wind or hydro so as to address environmental problems. 

On the other hand, I still believe that there are more benefits to the world business from global cooperation. Firstly, it can encourage international investment which will help the economy develop by increasing the employment rate in each country. This will bring more job opportunities for citizens which will improve people's life standards. Secondly, cooperation among  countries would help reduce  the tax on  international products, and citizens can easily approach other countries' products. In other words, more employment can be created and people's lives can be improved by  global cooperation in business. 

In conclusion, international cooperation has helped the countries in several ways. Even though cooperation among countries will help to protect the environment easier, I believe that it will bring more benefits for the global economy.",6,6.5
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","People have different views about the purpose of museums in modern society. While it’s true that museum – as tourist attractions – should be fascinating, I stand by the idea that the main role of the museum is to give knowledge of cultural, religious and historical importance.

On the one hand, it can be argued that museums should be entertaining and more attractive to the public. Museums are widely considered as important tourist attractions of any cities or countries. However, there’s a common belief that they are too elitist, uninspiring and only encourage educated people to visit. By adding more entertainment values, museums can appeal to a broader audience. Nowadays there is also a wide range of museums which do not have academic purpose; but more light-hearted and humorous theme; for example; chocolate museum in Belgium, kimchi museum in South Korea, museum of Broken Relationships in Croatia or cheese museum in The Netherlands.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that the main purpose of museums is to educate people as they exhibit collections of interesting objects that hold great cultural or historical values. The aim of any exhibitions is to teach visitors things that they didn’t know before. To achieve that, museums usually offer free guided tours with professional guides or give away brochures, guidebooks, audio tapes that contain detailed information about the exhibitions. By doing that, museums should play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.

In conclusion, I think museums, as educational institutions, should offer educative, interesting and enjoyable experiences to visitors.",4,5.5

I suppose, there are two reasons which have a significant role in this. One is curiosity and the other is the antique value of the house and the durability of the house. They can learn through the internet or from their elder neighbours. 

To begin with, people can search the past of their living space out of curiosity. An old house typically looks different from a new house. Consequently, people may get curious to learn about their houses. They might want to know more about the story behind the construction of the building. Such as, how was it looked before, what kinds of people used to live there, and who was the architect of the residence! Moreover, some may try to connect themselves through the archaeology of the building. Thus, people may get interested to explore more about their living space out of mere interest.

Secondly, some people may try to find out the history of their house due to safety concerns. They try to be assured whether the house is safe for living in or not. In other words, the time of making a house may help them to understand when they might have to renovate the residence. Furthermore, old buildings have antique value. For example, the media industry rents this kind of house for movies or TVCs at a high price. Thereby, things like safety concerns or antique value could be another reason for people to get interested in the past of their mansion.

There are many ways one can research their apartment or building. For instance, the internet and the elderly neighbours are the best sources to research the past of the building. In recent years, the internet has the data of old houses. Hence, one can collect information online. Additionally, elderly neighbours could play a significant role in this regard. They might have much detailed information which cannot be found on the web. 

To sum up, knowing the history of their own building makes people feel confident and special about their house. If people know about the time when it was built they can take the proper cautious approach. They can talk to local people and use internet platforms concerning facts.",8,7.5
"Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people believe that money is the main reason why employees want to remain in the same workplace for a long time, even there could be many other reasons why to stay. It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.
The reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
On the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.
In conclusion, I mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but I would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are.",5,6.0
Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. Discuss the both views and give your opinion.,"In this globalisation era, educational institute play an vital role in every student life. Some echelons of the society opines that eductional institute waste the time of the children because they teach extra things to the students while others think that its very fruitful for pupils to learn everything in school . I firmly agree with the former statement and i will discuss both views in the upcoming paragraphs.

 To begin with,  teachers waste a lot time to teach extra things to the pupils because some time children have no interest in extra curriculum activities.  For instance, some school compulsory the music subject in school but some students are not interested  in singing. So, it creates burden on the student .  Moreover, the syllabus are very tough due to more competition in these days and students have no time to do extra things because they concentrate only the main subjects . Furthermore, some school provides extra things for only money  and some its not beneficial for stundent . Its only motive to gain money not provide education.

  On the other hand,  sometimes other activities have many beneficial for students . First is that , they gain a more knowledge about the other curriculum activities and it will help in future. For instance, they learn dance in school and may it help to win the any dance competition . Additionally, they lean new skills such as cooperative and competitive. And its very helpful when they will doing job . They also learn communication skills in schools . So ,its very good source for students to learn extra things in school and sometimes they helpful in future.

In conclusion,  I retraite that institution waste the time of student by teach extra things because school motives only to gain money and it creates burden on the students.",5,6.0
Some people think that robots are important for humankind's future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In the modern era, robots are doing a lot of work. Some individuals believe that robots are significant for humankind's future development. Others think that robots have minor effects on society. In my point of view, robots have replaced development. The following paragraph will discuss you. 

On the one hand, using a robot makes many plus. First, we can do our work very easily and quickly without pressure. For example, nowadays, many companies use this. Because that replaces people's workplace. So, we can do the work with small employees. Moreover, they still wrote coding robots doing their work. That can do the job repeartly without bore. And can also control and change human. So business people more likely robots work. I read many research report. That includes robots' work can make more profit for business companies. 

On the other hand, using the robots creates some minus. One, robot usage will decrease humans' skills development and experience. Also, reduce work opportunities.So that will increase unemployment levels. After using robots, many people go to another country to work. Poor people are facing many problems about this. It can create a lot of distances with poor and rich people. It makes bad in our society. And many students are going to wrong way. Because robots replace their work life. 

In conclusion, increasing technology affects good and bad. We will use a good way, So we wo not go a negative way. We will develop all our skills. That can help our future life. do not waste our time. We will provide time to our future development. That will give many chances.",1,4.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In this era and age, we are observing a situation where we have an overproduction of consumer products with a consequent surplus of things that remain unused and then thrown away. This vast numerosity of offers that cannot be satisfied has an awful impact on the ecosystem because we are not able to recycle and give them a second life. This essay enlightens the possible causes such as lack of responsibility and the propension of developing countries to collect the developed countries’ garbage. Moreover, in the second paragraph, will be analysed the possible solutions of the previous causes. 

One of the clearest causes is the lack of responsibility for our planet that has led to a wasting propension, boosting and damaging the delicate balance of our environment. Nowadays, it is always more common to see people, especially in the metropolitans, not care about the separate waste collection, creating important issues for the entire recycling system chain. The other cause is the developing countries, which accept to pick up the waste of the developed nations even if they are not capable of recycling or storing it. Recently a video has become very popular, showing the sadness of this situation. In this video, it is shown an open dump in Sri Lanka where an entire group of elephants is looking for food. These countries, which suffer the most, need to be helped by the advanced ones and not used. 

To solve this horrible and dangerous situation we have to find some solutions. Firstly, one of the most efficient ways to solve the problem of lack of responsibility, probably, is to create a global campaign of sensibilization to persuade people from wasting. Furthermore, we should stay in the prime line to fight against the increase in the production of non-durable goods and avoid factories from overproducing, pushing second-hand products and giving a second opportunity to the used.  Secondly, it is necessary to operate globally to help and sustain the growing countries, which are the most vulnerable, closing intensive factories. In addition, the world authorities should take direct action such as penal and economic punishment against every company that exploits their employers and over products in developing countries.

We cannot waste other time like we usually waste consumer goods because it will be too late to solve the problem and we will not have a second chance. There is the necessity to come up with this situation through the cooperation of every nation, creating global rules and policy, but we have to start from the bottom and everyone has to make a difference.",4,5.5
"In some countries ordinary citizens are allowed to keep a gun in their house. Some people think this is a good idea, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, in some ,nations the use of guns has become common. People have different views on keeping weapons at home. While some assert that citizens should be allowed to keep a firearm in their homes, I personally side with those who maintain that this issue is not a good idea.

On the one hand, some hold the idea that people should be allowed to have a gun in their accommodation because the amount of crime in their society is high. In some ,countries the statistics of robbery are increasing and citizens do not feel safe as well as they have to have a handgun against such crimes for saving themselves and their family from such a potential danger. For example, last week a famous French soccer player was able to use his personal weapon to force some robbers, who had forcibly attacked his house, to run away.    

On the other hand, 2 reasons may well explain why others believe that ordinary men and women should not be permitted to keep a shotgun on their properties. Firstly, many buy a warm firearm with the excuse of protecting themselves but use it for illegal purposes. For instance, since the legalization of weapon ownership, the number of shootings in American schools has multiplied. Another example is that some people hunt  animals and birds with these weapons which have caused serious damage to the environment. Secondly, there are many gun-related injuries, or even murders in the worst-case scenario, reported every day due to a lack of enough skills while using or cleaning a handgun. 

In conclusion, although some say families must have firearms in their lodging, I strongly feel that to decrease the shooting rates and protection of living creatures, governments should not allow their nations to keep a firearm at home.",8,7.5
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people are of the opinion that a great way to mitigate famished and impoverished rate is grows the economy. However, some others are opposed to this idea, claiming that increasing economy is negative affects on natural environments. Both views are true to some extents, but I believe the former is more rational.

I can understand some why people believe that rising economy has an adverse effect on the  environments as well as human beings. It is mean that the development of industrial zones and individual corporations to promote trade leads to releasing a mass of emissions into the general air or industrial waste discharging out rivers and oceans. Consequently, the air and source of water are polluted and threaten to humans’ health. Furthermore, the environmental pollution is cause lowering biodiversity not only for plants but also for animals. For example, fish in many rivers in the vicinity the industry areas tend to died due to toxic wastes that emitted into habitat and directly affect in their respiratory system of them.

On the other hand, there are several arguments why I support the statement that starvation and poverty would be addressed when economy thrives and expands. First of all, the development of economy leads to rising government’s budget that used for education and welfare aims as well as support those who are in difficult circumstances. Highland areas of Vietnam, for instance, where the majority of children don’t inherit an adequate and quality education and they live in an extreme weather, concerning of policymakers help them to improve better condition in rising the level of education and living standards, leading to ensuring their later life that is not burden to the society. Secondly, economy growth generate a lot of  job opportunities for  those at unemployed status or low level of education. This can lead to lowering unemployed rate and increasing gross domestic products.

In conclusion, my believe that the development of economy has negative affects on environmental resources. However, it also plays an important role in growing economy and addressing a part burdens of society.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.


To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Children are the backbone of every country.So, there are people who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will result in flourished society and the individual growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

To begin with,  social work with children can be easily associated with personality development because during this drive, they tend to communicate with a variety of people, leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance,patience,team spirit,cooperation can be learnt. Besides that, young mind serves the country with full enthusiasm that gives them feeling of fulfilment and self satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brim them with self confidence and patriotic feeling.Moreover, going and experiencing multiple culture and tradition make their horizon, so broad that add one more feather in their cap.

However, It is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate in different curriculum activities, endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers and in the competitive world they should not be expected to serve society without their self benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment in their mind.

In conclusion, I believe, notion of teenagers doing unpaid work is indeed good, but proper monitoring and care should be given to avoid untoward consequences.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this?","Recently, more and more people have been interested in the history of their own city  construction like the houses they live in and the landscapes in their hometown. Here are some reasons to show us why people are interested in and how to investigate.

I think why people are interested in the history of their hometown is the COVID. During this quarantine period, people can only have fun in their own city or country that someplace has never been to Now is their only chance to go out  travel. For example, I went to Green Island which was beside  the mainland of Taiwan. It was my first to go to the island. This island was full of natural species and local traditional culture. We visited an old house which was made of very flat stone and had many layers. When I was in the house I couldn't imagine how the house was built and why people had to use this style to make a house. So it caused  me interested in finding out about the history of their house and also their culture.

First, most time I went to the local library to find  information about the stone house how they built and why they needed to build it like this. Second, I visited  local people's houses to ask old men for help. They told us the history of their local cultures and stone was the common material to get and the house not only gets warm but also gets against cold winds.

In  conclusion, If there doesn't have COVID I can't understand how fun my hometown is and also realize how  people make their own houses in the lack of materials in that direction.",7,7.0
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"At the present time, most students are facing a hard time concentrating at school. It is very common to get distracted from the work or study you are involved in especially if you lack interest. Furthermore, involving in different activities at the same time also affects the level of attentiveness in an individual. This essay will discuss the above-mentioned causes in  detail and provide  feasible solutions.

Firstly, in this modern time, everyone has  access to the internet and holds their private smartphone from an early age. It's comparatively easier for a young mind to get influenced by actors, gamers, YouTubers and so on. As a result, they want to pursue the same fields, lacking interest in study which makes them difficult to pay focus on the subject matter. In addition, the children are nowadays pressured a lot to be versatile leading towards hectic day-to-day life schedule. For instance, attending different extra classes such as swimming, dancing, singing and many more from morning to evening. Hence, the children are tired and lack the proper amount of rest or sleep, for this reason, it's difficult to focus in the classrooms.

To tackle the above-mentioned problem, the parents have a crucial role to play.  , limiting their children's screen time, and access to private mobile phones only at a mature age, motivating and guiding them in the correct path protecting them from the distraction of glam lifestyles. Moreover, the children should not be forced into multiple activities that can result in futile outcomes. Helping them find their actual interest and focusing on that specific task can be beneficial to excel in that activity as well as maintaining focus in school.

In conclusion, the pressure on the student to be an all-rounder leading towards a fatigue lifestyle and influence of social media, and a lack of interest in studying are the major reasons for distraction. It can be resolved with little effort from parents.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Yongsters are the backbone of every economy. A part of the society believes that young people should take part in some voluntary work for the welfare of the society while, others reject htis notion. Honestly, I partially agree with the above testimonial. Therefore, I will explicate the reasons behind this viewpoint in upcoming paragraphs and thus will lead to a logical conclusion as well.

To begin with, if the teenagers agree to participate in unpaid community jobs, this is going to asist them to gain more knowledge regarding the fields that needs improvement in their infrastructure and further, this is going to be helpful for the development of the nation. Whereas, instead of doing voluntary jobs, young generation needs to utilise their time in most productive areas like higher studies that would help them getting better jobs in future because time is precious and it should be utilised carefully.

Furthermore, the prominent extrapolate of indulging in community workks for the teenagers could be gaining experience that could help them for going further in their career. For instance, in India, some volunteers are given opportunity to teach the poor kids in evening at the temple  therefore, this not only benefits the society but it also beneficial for the individual that provides his or her service because in future, this experience might help them in obtaining the job of professor at a good faculity. 

In the final analises, according to the statements aforementioned above there might be some pros of rendering community service but its potentional cons should not be overlooked either.",3,5.0
Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only  government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, the increasing population has caused trouble in purchasing lands. On the one hand,  the society argues the fact that authorities should make remedy actions to fix an issue of inadequate  residences. However, on other hand, people themselves should solve this issue. I partially agree  with the given statement, and I will provide the substantiate argument in upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it another way, government should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses.  Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the issue of even distribution of  homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore,  are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes  to bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example,  the Canadian government restrict the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the issue of housing shortage.  On a contrary, people could also solve this issue by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer  living in villages and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. People can find more job  opportunities like farming in villages to earn a livelihood. This would help in bringing more  employment in the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages. The fresh air  of villages would also make people more healthy and less stressed. Therefore, it would reduce  crimes in society.  To conclude, although people move to metropolitan cities in search of better opportunities,  they still face residential issues. Therefore, it is the responsibility of both government and people to resolve the issue by encouraging people to live in vertical housing and villages.",1,4.0
"In some citites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.","Traffic congestion is an issue in  urban centres.In some parts of urban places around the globe,an increase in traffic cramps is an issue.The causes are people using their own cars and  not working from home.However,solutions like  taking public transportation and telecommuting are actions to curtain the phenomenon.The essay will explain in detail the  causes as well as solutions to tackle the problems in the subsequent paragraphs with examples.

To begin with ,there are several factors for the rise of  traffic jams in the cities.Firstly,the majority of people in the cities prefer to use their own private cars to go to work and most students too travel around the same time.This causes congestion during  peak hours.Although workers will  feel comfortable with their vehicles ,others will suffer.Moreover,most employees are not working from home which leads to an increase in traffic because a lot of them are travelling to work within the same period.If workers work from home,there will be no  jams.For instance,during the covid 19 period ,companies made their staffs   work from home which helped ensure the easy flow of vehicles on the road.Therefore, an increase in private car usage and personnel not working from home are the two factors of  increased cramps in the cities.

Secondly,there are several solutions to tackle the problem of congestion.Individuals should take public transportation so that the number of cars on the road will reduce.It will ensure free flow  on the road.It will help employees and students to reach their destinations on time.For example,in Adiembra , most students and workers take public transport and this has led to ease flow on the highway.Furthermore,telecommuting is when  personnel works from their various houses.The initiative will help tackle the jams problems because employees will be working from home.

In conclusion ,private vehicle usage and personnel not working from home are the two factors for the rise of traffic cramps in the towns whereas measures such as taking public transport and working from home will help tackle the problem.",3,5.0
"Machines are taking over more and more jobs previously done by humans.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.","Human biengs are being replaced by machinaries these days. This is quite evident in the economy as more and more people are unemployed due to the revolution of technology and fast paced economy. Though there are certain flaws associated with the sentiment, similarly there are certain benefits attached with it. I would detail it in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, from the perspective of humankind it can be seen that machines are taking over thier role. Majority of industrial sectors are installing equipment to get thier work done, which is costing the jobs of the employees working in there. For instance; Rearing of milk from cattles have shifted to sucking machines which was earlier done by humans. Secondly, from employer's view point work is getting done at a faster pace and with no dependency on labour, which in turn skyrockets the profit. Hence, employee working in the organisation have to capitulate under the conandrum, for example: TCS have laid off upto 20% of employee by substituting them with AI designed interface.

However, there are certain benefits associated with these changes and they are as follows: work that used to be tedious and time consuming have transformed to be fast paced and effective, examples such as; sorting, labeling, packing and dispatching. To add on, Employers less inclination towards employees have made them indepedent. They no need to worry on turnover rate of employees nor they have to focus on meeting their psychological needs.

To conclude, I would opine that employers should integrate eventually both the machinery and employees, rather than replacing them completely. It is because I do believe there certain work which cannot be done by machines as it would need the emotional quotient capability of humans, which machines cannot surpass.",6,6.5
News media is important in our society. Why is it so important? Do you think its influence is generally positive or negative?,"News are an indispensable part of our everyday life. Media produces a great service to everyone in any situation. This essay will explain us important, positive and negative effects of news in the following paragraphs.

News play a significant role in our lives. News make people aware about the upcoming threats, politics and many other things happening all over the world. There are several news channels which broadcast the news in different language and also give live updates of the current situation. This can be helpful to the masses to gain knowledge easily. News are telecasted by different ways like as T.V, radio, internet, social sites which are helpful for people to gain information in many situations. There are many benefits of news as without the news media, we would be totally in the dark and cut off from the rest of the world. Firstly they are the mediator of Human beings to the government as with the help of a reporter's individual can raise their voice on any issue and local bodies can listen and help to tackle the problem. Moreover, they can provide justice to the common man. To add more, they help to spread the culture and lifestyle of different     areas all over the globe. As well as, there are many separate news programs related to business, politics, weather, and environmental issues. This makes us easy to select the program according to their own Choice.

On the other hand, the media has some downsides as they telecast some wrong information on their channels which lead to many conflicts, riots, violation and protect in the society. Furthermore, paparazzi shows, private life of famous personalities to improve troops and this is not a good thing to show the personal activity in front of the whole world.

"Some people think that students benefit from going to private secondary schools. Others, however, feel that private secondary schools can have a negative effect on society as a whole. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Some would argue that private secondary schools could be beneficial for students. Others would argue that the concept of private schools influences society negatively. I believe that the idea of private schools may hurt students and families because these alternatives put a huge stain on households and have a negative psychological effects on adolescents. 

Some part of society believe students can advantage from private schools through their fascilities and special treatments from tutors. With the help of private education most students with low academic scores could be more successful than their counterparts who are studying in public schools. To illustrate this, private schools in Europe, their annual prices fluctuated between 10 and 20 thousands euros, provide small groups of classrooms and extracurricular activites for their students. The aim of these initials is to improve their students' academic success. However, their prices put a huge burden on households and this one drawback makes these schools unaffordable for many families. 

Another approach to private education that the idea of paid education affects society negatively. Adolescents who cannot afford these schools may think they are not worthy to private education and they will be unsuccessful. These psychological questions can come up to their minds in that ages and influence them negatively. For example, many students before starting further education careers admit that they might be lack in some areas that private schools offer and this can affect their collage applications in a negative way. This kind of psychological barrier is too much for adolescents and private schools are the only reason to this. 

In conclusion, the fascilities and conveniences of private schools could be beneficial for students, however, I believe their prices are unaffordable for many households and their existence could harm other adolescents' psychologies.",2,4.5
"Nowadays in many countries most shops and products are the
same. Some people feel this is a positive development, while
others disagree.
Discuss both views and state your opinion.","The importance of international trade which was always debatable has now become more controversial with many people claiming that it is beneficial while others reject this notion. The substantial influence of this movement has sparked  controversy over its potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, the former proposition appears to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate on both the positive & negative effects of this direction & thus will lead to  a logical conclusion.

There are myriad  reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one stem from the fact that international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe.  Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that Due to globalization, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country Needless to say, all these merits stand in  good stead.

However, there are some pitfalls that negate this arguments & which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this direction but one of the most alarming one is that there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Besides, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally  Hence, it is apparent why many are against this tendency.

According to the arguments aforementioned above, one can reach  a conclusion that the benefits of global business are instrumental indeed. In my opinion, its potential drawback should not be overlooked either.",7,7.0
The only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Road safety has become a pipe dream for most individuals living on Earth. Everyday a significant number of people become victims of accidents thus making it a global concern. Although a plethora of steps have been taken to alleviate these mishaps, the number of casualties have not declined yet. Some people hold the view that punishing drivers is the only way to ameliorate road safety, while I believe that it is necessarily not the only solution. This essay tends to explain the reasoning behind my viewpoint.

To begin with, drivers are not the only persons to be blamed for these casualties, highway conditions are also responsible. Nowadays, streets are constructed with substandard materials, accordingly, potholes are formed during the rainy season. Similarly, ongoing maintenance of streets leaves behind dug-up roadways without any proper barricades. Unavailability of street lights also exacerbates the problem. For instance, recently an Indian girl was run over by a truck. At first her scooter fell in a pit and she fell on the road, before she could get up a truck hit her because the trucker did not see her due to darkness.

Additionally, inferior vehicle conditions contribute to accidents. In Bangladesh, most public buses are 10 to 20 years old, but are still running on the highways. So, in times of emergency, it is impossible for the operators to stop the vehicle. In worst scenarios the buses can collide with another automobile, killing all the passengers on board. Moreover, there are no organised  traffic regulations and highway patrol in most cities hence no security. Due to dysfunctional traffic lights, crossing of pedestrians and cars coincide resulting in misfortunes. Considering all these, the government should be held blameworthy as it is the authority's responsibility to provide safer public transportation and systematic traffic rules.

To conclude, mishaps are caused not only by reckless driving but by several other factors. Improved roadways, vehicles and laws are indispensable to enhance the safety of our roads. Therefore, I disagree with the given statement.",4,5.5
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free 
time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual 
teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Young adults disciplines and their work-life  have always been a highly controversial issue. It is often argued that many hold the idea that occupying the  adolescents  ought to be compulsory regardless of  the salary as it could bring both personal merits and social plus points. I partially agree and disagree with this statement for two main reasons. This essay will elaborate on these opinions. 

To commence,it is believed that early employments tend to bring a plethora of advantages. First of all, by being employed ,the seniors between the age of fourteen and sixteen might  become perfectly  skilled and provided  with job requirements such as  punctuality and financial management. Secondly,there is no shadow of a doubt that  If enlistments are invited to jobs in their early phases of adulthood they will achieve their goals faster.Therefore,  younger-age recruitments might pave the way for the candidates on their career path.

On the other hand, adulthood has always been a critical stage of life regarding  wise decisions. At this ,age human beings have  a tendency to make progress in the study and flourish their competencies. Following this  mandatory task,the  students will be deprived of their liberty in making choices .Similarly, this compulsory activity might pose an obstacle in their study advancements. Furthermore, a lucrative salary could play a key role in encouraging them to attract to the workforce. In other words, if they are not paid ,gradually ,they will become reluctant and find the occupation useless. To exemplify, child labour considers themselves a victim as well as adopting a pessimist approach to the future.

To conclude, although entering  young adults into the workforce can carry  a myriad of social and personal advantages. I reaffirm my position on this notion that I partially agree and disagree with it as  it is highly likely that they work the way  up the ladder and become highly successful in their professional life but they eventually  will lose their interest in employment due to the lack of  adequate salary",9,8.0

There is an argument that says that a lot of stuff that has been taught for children is such a waste of time! However, others believe that studying at these institutions is helpful and meaningful at some point. In my point of view, I agree that these places are really useful. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both sides and support my opinion.

To begin with, the reasons behind believing that institutions like kindergarten, primary and elementary faculty are useless because the way that the educational environment limits and kills the children creativity and intelligence. For instance, there is an international kindergarten in my city, and my friend has a son who studied at it she thought they  used a terrible method of teaching young children, which is studying from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and just 15 minutes for playing, and there is a mid-term and flint test. She believes that her son was excited and smart before. That’s why she thinks  kindergarten was a bad idea and her child was suffering. 

In contrast, people argue that the educational society ,for example, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and elementary schools have many advantages. First, it sharpens the child’s mind and improves the skills of thinking. Like they are studying math, so they can count. Second, it helps to build a relationship with peers and become social hence, he will be friendly, kind, respectful and cooperative. Moreover, solving the problems, she/he will depend on her/home self such as tie his shoes, wear his coat and go to the bathroom. A recent study shows that  COVID-19 time records a significant increase in the number of children who become less creative and social  because they spent two years studying at home. They lost their ability to communicate with their mates and become more violent. Finally, teachers play  role models in children’s lives. When you ask a child who is his teacher in nursery school? Most of them will answer the question and confirm that these instructors were a reason for being successful. My orphan uncle, who lost his parents early, and felt lonely, his hair was messy and wore a dirty uniform. But his teacher was kind and merciful. She was his second mother and encouraged him. Now my uncle is one of the greatest doctors because of her.

To conclude, while some people think that schools have a negative impact on young individuals. I strongly believe that educational communities play a vital role in a child’ life.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
 
 Discuss both views, and give your opinion.","Many think that college and university graduates will have a successful career in the future and other says it is good to get a job after high school study. In my opinion, getting job after high school study can give early start-up but for the long term success college or university degree is mandatory for everyone to shape their career in a right way. 

Many argue that it is better to get a job after high school study because they find work is more important to earn rather than just study. Everyone have their individual choices and accordingly they shape thier career. For an example, many people join their family business during high school vacation or get a job to gain a short term experience and after this period of time they find work is more important to earn well instead planning to study further. Furthermore, many have set business plans or startups which they want to begin after high school study because they don't want to do job all their career but set-up a business in the future.

However, others believe that college and university degrees will allow themselves to enter to the fastest growing professional world because nowadays degree is the most important thing to get well packaged job. For instance, to get a job in big companies like, apple, Tata consultancy, Google, etc. bachelor or master degree is the basic requirements for everyone. Moreover, graduate studies will open up both the ways for everyone who wants to get a good job and for those who wants to start a business in the future because it gives academic skills and field projects as well which can help people to boost field experience which can lead them to shape their career in a proper way. 

To sum up, despite the benifits of starting a job after high school study, people should engage more in academic field to shape their career and by doing that they can achieve their long term goals and better living lifestyle.",6,6.5
"Movies and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have a negative effect on society and should be censored. Others say they are just harmless relaxation.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","The entertainment industry has pumped out many famous products and franchises, most of which are “violent content” rated. Some people argue that the bloor-and-gore contents on the market could have a bad effect on mental health and shouldn’t be displayed, while others think that it is normal and enjoyable. While action movies and games do display violent contents, I believe these creative products are for entertainment purposes and could help consumer to have a good time.

There is a belief hold by a number of people that popular movies and video games with violent contents are giving out negative effects on the mental and social health of the consumers. There are many famous action/horror movie titles such as Wrong Turn, The Cabin Fever, Zombieland. These contents are publicly distributed and the gruesome scenes could reach out to many audiences. This kind of entertainment industry that profits from violent contents could have a bad consequence on society because people who bought this would think to themselves that violent is normal. A friend of mine is a gang member and he told me he got his motivation to join from watching movies about  cocain mafia gangster like Tony Montana.

On other hand, some people argue that movies and games containing violence are there for entertainment purposes mostly. The violence itself is the reminder of what could happen have we acted uncivilized. We are exposed to the gruesome parts and see it for what it is so we don’t ask to seek it in our real life. Take some well-known video games for example - Battlefield, Left 4 Dead, Counter Strike - these action/shooting games are here for us to releast our anger and stress and it has been working well for many decades. Me and my friends all play games, we shoot in video games but we never need to own guns in real life. We don’t have a need for guns because video games is enough to satisfy us in this regard. Not forget to mention that every movies and games in the market right now are labeled, viewers are warned and they have the option to not proceed further with the content. 

In conclusion, a lot of the famous movies and video games are adult rated. Some people see these violent contents as bad for the society and calling for censorship, while others see action and horror movie/game titles as a way to escape reality, to be entertained in a different world. I think that it is harmless as it is mainly used to ease stress from our mind and provide us with an entertainment service.",4,5.5
Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.
First and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.
Now, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.
To sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.",8,7.5
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"Many companies, nowadays, must increase their sales, so they are increasing the number of advertisements in order to compete with other companies. This brings both positive and negative effects on customers, therefore government should have methods to lessen this problem which discuss in this essay.
Increasing in a number of advertisements from many companies can cause advantages and disadvantages to customers. For the former, people will get more information about product that they want to buy and can compare about their costs, function and services after selling. this can help them to choose the products which suitable for them. However, for the latter, a large number of advertisements may annoy people when they watch main television programs. In addition, those advertisements may attract people to need to buy the product that are not necessary for them. Moreover, when companies spend their budget on advertising, they also set higher price on their products. This leads people to lose their money more over.
There are many means to solve this problem. First of all, governments should control the quality and the numbers of advertisements. They should allow only advertisements showing fact information and control the number of broadcasting per day in order to help people to get real information for decision to buy products and less annoying them. Additionally, people should be permitted to decide that they will watch or reject those advertisements by skipping those are not interesting.
In conclusion, a large number of advertisements cause benefits and drawbacks to customers which they can get more information, while they may be annoyed and spend more money by not necessary. Therefore, governments should control quality and the number of them and permit people to skip some advertisements to help people from disturbing.",1,4.0
News media is important in our society. Why is it so important? Do you think its influence is generally positive or negative?,"The news media has gained a lot of importance in our society. Through News media we come to know about the daily issues of the community. The news is readily available through newspapers, magazines, television, radio and the internet. Each and every media is a powerful medium, in itself. I personally feel that there is a positive impact of news on people.

News help people to learn something new every day. In addition to that it helps people to develop an open and critical mind. As a citizen of a country we all should be aware of our country's economic situation, sports, games which are very well provided through news media and not only one's country news, News about the whole world is presented.

Probing further, we can say News allows us to have a broader understanding of local, national and international affairs. News is not only limited educational purpose. It has also come up as the source of entertainment. We can get to know about the release date of the new films and what's going on in the lives of our favourite film stars.

However, there are other aspects too, whereas on one hand News is considered as a medium through which we come to know about the economic situation of our country but nowadays the focus of the News has shifted to some less important aspects such as news about film stars are coming to light instead of some serious issues. 

All in all, I strongly feel that the news media play a crucial role in the society. Internet has emerged as a strong medium of news. Because of news media more awareness is spread among the masses, especially the youth of the country is more enlightened.",5,6.0
"Scientists tell us that some activities are good for health and others are bad. Despite knowing that, millions of people still continue doing unhealthy activities. What are the causes and what are the solutions for this","The skyrocketing advancement of illness prevention like healthy activity campaigns has a significant impact on society, which  lowers risks of emerging and acute diseases. However, many people still engage in unhealthy behaviour in their daily lives because of social media influence, increasing junk food trends, as well as poor health awareness and this essay will discuss the measures in tackling these catastrophes.

The culprits behind the continuity of unhealthy conduct  vary. Firstly, social media plays a pivotal role in controlling the public's behaviour as a great number of people use it daily and heavily influence people because of the social media influencers' fabricated unproductive lifestyles. Secondly, the increasing number of fast-food franchises also affects the community's unhealthy food consumption. The cheap prices and major promotions done by these fast-food companies worsen this phenomenon. Lastly, the public has a significantly low self-awareness about their wellness, either because they do not know the negative outcome of their behaviour or are just ignorant about it.

To handle these issues, social media influencers should not be paid by the platforms for promoting unhealthy routines to the audiences. Furthermore, the government has to incentivize healthy food tenants to help thrive in the culinary industry and compete with junk-food franchises. Finally, health workers need to hold more campaigns about disrupted well-being that is caused by poor lifestyles.

In conclusion, the handlement of unhealthy conduct needs to be done by many stakeholders to ensure the success rate. Online platforms, governments, and health workers have to work together to fight this phenomenon by limiting social media influencers from promoting awful health actions, financially aiding healthy cuisine tenants, and conducting more campaigns about self-wellness to raise community awareness.",6,6.5
Some people think that illegal Internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that they have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The music industry has been dying over the past few decades. While some people believe that this effect is due to the illegal music downloads over the internet, others advocate that music artists do not get affected by the people who obtain their products illegally. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my support for the latter view. 

A conventional music track takes plenty of hard work and a plethora of money for its production. However, due to unauthorized downloads and unsold copies in the market, the producer remains unable to gather much profit out of it. As a result, the music industry is facing a decline by being unable to produce effective and worth listening tracks. A recent survey by T-Series Entertainment suggested that the music producers are facing almost 29% loss from their productions due to unauthorized internet downloading. To cover these losses, the producers are left with no option other than cost-cutting by investing less money to produce precious tracks. However, the music artists usually get their complete cut to sing the songs irrespective of the income generated out of the track.

On the other hand, music artists usually don’t rely on singing tracks for their income, rather they earn a huge portion of their income by performing the songs in parties and concerts. Moreover, the advertisement industries and endorsement agencies also take part in income generations for music artists. For instance, a well-known singer in India revealed his breakup of income for the year 2019, and the most part of it constituted inflow from brand endorsements and concerts. Therefore, it can be said that the importance of track being famous is more crucial for the artist, rather than the profit generated out of it.

To sum up, the music industry gets affected by illegal downloads as the producers are unable to generate effective income from the sold copies, however, the artists usually rely on other factors like advertisements and parties to generate their income. In my opinion, the cyber-crime authorities should become active in eradicating the feasibility for internet users to download music tracks free of cost.",8,7.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is thought by some people that we ought to live with climate change instead of trying to reverse or prevent it. I completely disagree with this as there is no way to coexist with climate change.
It is almost impossible to live in a world that suffers from global warming since multiple evidences exist to show how badly affected the earth is. For example, the weather has severely changed in recent decades and the temperature is always increasing. This change in the weather has contributed to several disasters such as wildfires in various countries in the world, hurricanes, floods, droughts, as well as melting glaciers. Additionally, many species are endangered because their natural habits are threatened by global warming.
The reasons why all these environmental issues started are human activities, and thus, we must be responsible for what we did. Numerous steps can be taken by humans to stop climate change and reverse its effects. Scientists and environmentalists have been working hand in hand to find methods that can mitigate climate change. For instance, many projects are being carried worldwide to plant more trees in order to absorb as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as possible. Carbon dioxide, which is one of the greatest contributors to global warming, has been released in abundance due to deforestation. Due to that, planting trees is a plausible countermeasure to deforestation. Moreover, other methods to eliminate climate change include reducing pollution, banning plastics, becoming vegan, and using environmentally friendly transportation methods, such as cycling.
To conclude, the catastrophic impact that climate change has on earth makes it unimaginable to find a way to live with it instead of preventing it. We are all part of one ecosystem and the decline of one of its parts leads to severe consequences for everyone.",9,8.0
"As major cities in the world are growing today , so do their problems . What are the problems for young people who are living in the cities as the result of continued growth ? What are the solutions for these problems","In the large developing metropolises , the number of issues for teenagers is occurring day by day due to this growth . Besides , there is a variety of measures which is able to be offered to tackle the problems. 

On the one hand , people should recognize the fact that there is a number of problems  which are associated with living in the cities of young people . Firstly , one difficulty is the poor infrastructure. To illustrate this point , the youths have to face the high risk of poor facilities that is existed when they hire a house . Moreover, they are able to not only deal with inadequate sewage facilities but also cope with water and sanitation problems that make them have to suffer from health problems for skin. Secondly , another problem is high crime rates. In addition , individuals who live in hiring houses can deal with offenders , such as rapists and thieves who create injury for the sense of teenagers . Besides,  teenagers have to struggle with the financial burden taken care of daily . 

On the other hand , many measures should be taken to address the issues . One simple approach would be to offer more professional opportunities for educators . For instance , this activity assists  teenagers to have occupations and solve unemployment in order to save money that aids them to pay costs associated with the sanitation of scholars . Additionally , the leaders of nations should offer serious disciplining policies that are likely to be applied for diminishing vigorously the crime rates to ensure explicitly the safety of young people . 

In conclusion , it is clear that there is a variety of issues relating to young people who live in a large improving metropolis . However , there are many approaches which should be applied for addressing the difficulties .",10,8.5
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"A group of the public argues that young children should serve a community free of cost in their leisure time, which helps to carry out fruitful results for both of them. I strongly support that view of people because doing social tasks will not only help teenagers and chance to explore skills but also provides helping hands to people.

Being engaged in social work gives mental and physical satisfaction to juveniles. In their busy lifestyle, they don’t have time for extra curriculum activities  and get more depressed. But working on community task give a chance to them to divert their energy in a good way which helps in reducing their depression. For example :- a study carried out by a university in the United States in which get results that adolescents who serve in the community for 10 hours are less likely to feel depressed as compared to those who do not  volunteer.

Additionally, doing volunteer work with youngsters gives aid to society for a better living environment. Many organizations efforts to the improvements of structure and environmental conditions of society which leads people to obtain a superior quality of living style. To illustrate :-India a campaign was started by the Indian Prime Minister with unpaid workers in which they sweep roads and planted herbaceous trees on the sides of roads to overcome air pollution which ultimately benefits the local crowd.

In conclusion, I think, volunteer job is two-sided benefits, so stepping forward for the public effort by juveniles to utilize their energy in a positive direction and individuals get welfare in society.",7,7.0
"Some people think that it is beneficial for students to go to private secondary schools, but others think that it has negative effects.
Discuss both points of view and give your own oipnion","school is where the person gets an education and is a creative person in his life. there are two different types of school privat and loca. the private one is the one that people think  is beneficial while others say it is negative. in this ,easy we will discuss  both views and I will give some examples.

First of all, a lot of parents prefer  private school because they take responsibility for the children. They make sure that the young person gets the full knowledge also the family think that their children In I safe place. For example, during the break time for the children the teachers look after all of  them while they are playing. In my opinion, any mother will like her baby to be in a good condition.

On the other hand, a particular school is so expensive, so a lot of families can’t afford it. The reason why  private school is so expensive is that the children get special treatment. For example, my young sister  is the only one who was going to a private institution because she was alone in the school while my other sibling and I were together at a local school at the same time to support each other.

In conclusion, private school has a positive and negative effects, positive prefer is a special treatment for your child while the negative impact is so expensive. In my opinion, the private school have more responsibility for the children and their education and they make the family  be satisfied.",7,7.0
"Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued than educational institutions main role is to develop good member of society and hardworkers, rather than focusing on the development of a students' individual qualities. The paragraphs below will outline a strong agreement about this trend. 

To begin with, I believe schools must display an important part in teaching young people about citizenship. The reason for this is because morality and honesty, which are collective characteristics essential to maintain a good coexistense among others, are learned from the very basis, thus being effective. Through acquiring knowledge about these social manners, children may grown respectfully and well-mannered. Moreover, active teaching strategies can be used to show to expose how to be a model citizen properly. For instance, in Brazilian schools, primary-aged students are introduced to voting and policies' seminars, to develop citizen conscience. 

Furthermore, I consider that the subjects taught are determinant to prepare the students to the labor market in the future. Several companies nowadays demand hard-skilled individuals to certain jobs. For example, during an interview to be system manager of a company, the tiebreaker point to choose between me and other contestant was a math problem. Therefore, learning topics in mathematics, english or history may augment the possibilities of being hired in adulthood. 

To conclude, I strongly agree that the main purpose of educational institutions are and should be transmitting about citizenship and work effort to keep building a moral and honest society, and to increase chances of fulfilling a career in the coming years.",5,6.0
"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.

Discuss both view and give your opinion.","In this modern era, many business man would like to start international business in order to people are gotten more benefit. However, a fair amount of people think that the expanding business and cultural contact between nations gives many positive effects while others say that this trend causes the loss of national identities. Viewing from a general perspective, the essay discusses both viewpints, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

On the one hand, there are many advantages will come when the country will collaborate withtin another country in many ways such as business and cultural. Firstly, the job opportunity are dramatically increased in order to both the countries citizens are gotten benefit. Secondly, they are allowed to use them own country resources while the government are obtained huge tax from business human as a result these kinds of activities is one of the reason for nation improvements. For example, many developed countries are minkled to stard marketing who developing countries such as India as a result an Indian folks are gotten many work from these companies.

On the other hand, this situations are brought more effects for loss of state uniqueness irrefutably. This trend will continue while the state will never have a chance to develop because beetween countries are always need to collaborate in any circumstances as a result many foreigners are gotten employment cpmpared to local state human. For instance,a recend survey said that many underdeveloped nations are suffered to this plan in form to they are lost their original uniqueness.

To conclude, undoubtedly this project is brought  both positive as well negative. Nevertheless, In my opinion about this plan gets more advantages to the both countries when they are being collobrated to do marketing and other events too as a result automatically both territory as well as the individuals financial status  will improve dramatically.",4,5.5
"Experts believe that, over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. 

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Nowadays, artificial intelligence is starting to change many aspects of life in the world.One of these innovations is a robot and a lot of scientists made assumptions that many operations will be done by robots in the near future. In my view, this invaluable effect has certain negative and positive points simultaneously, which will be discussed in this essay.

The main advantage, what can i mention  it  is a fact that people can get free from wasting time on useless and petty work. Or conversely, saving workers from too dangerous operations. For instance, robots can work instead of employers who work in mountainous areas or toxic factories, where ordinary people are under the threat. Moreover, there are many establishments, where work must never stop and where robots can help a lot with their continuous work without interruption. As a result, production work will improve significantly.

Despite positive facts, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, cases of unemployment will become greater. 

If menial labour is done by robots, people without education will lose their jobs and poverty will comes.Subsequently, the demographic situation around the world will be deplorable. As a example, majority of people in Kazakhstan do not have professional degree and have to work in workplaces as wage-earners.

All things considered, besides many positive impacts people will be exposed by negative facts.",0,<4
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.
What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Nowadays, no matter in urban or suburb the whole world, traffic jam has become a serious problem and cause massive attention. In my view, there is too much population currently and cause high deservation of car use, and the government should promote well-equipped public transport to solve these issues.

Nowadays, the population is sharply growing, promoting the deservation of private car use and the need for public transportation. As a result, traffic jams and car crashes frequently happen both in the city and town, enhancing severe traffic conditions. For example, the traffic condition is terrible during the rush hour in the morning and evening, too many people driving their cars to work and back home at the same time and crowded the road quickly.

It is commonly believed that too much driving may cause air pollution. However, it is more convenient for workers to drive a private car instead of taxing public buses. Thus, the government should take prmote the advertise to encourage people to take the subway and save energy.

In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to promote fundamental public transportation, such as the subway and bus. Moreover, it is necessary to increase the shift of the subway and bus, which office workers mostly use. Besides, the government should issue some kinds of action. For example, the prices will decline by 50% during the rush hour by bus or underground, set more common-share bicycles for free and encourage people to go to work instead of taking a taxi.",3,5.0

Firstly, this essay will look at why famous persons are famed for their high-profile living style rather than their achievements and secondly, I will explain how we are falling in this direction ,especially since our new kids are adapting to this culture more.",0,<4
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 
What is your opinion?","With the advancement of ,technology people tend to rely upon many technically advanced equipment, including artificially intelligent robots. However, some people strongly believe that at last all jobs will be done by these things by replacing the human  workforce. I believe that even the technical advancement and reliance on robots make our lives easier, we can't completely rely on these things as mankind.

Especially, in developed countries factories with massive production depend on robots. Actually, these things are very efficient, cost-effective, and smart. Because, in here once we coded them they follow all the instructions without bargaining. Thereby, it is very easy to cover targets on time without any delay. As well as it allows people to reduce their busyness as well as reduce their responsibilities, which help in relaxing them. With the help of artificially intelligent ,robots people would be able to allocate their extra time to other useful things.

However, totally we cannot depend on such kinds of machinery things, because these machines are lack  emotions, rational thinking, decision-making ability, adapting to real-life situations like us. For ,example we cannot replace doctors, nurses, counsellors with robots. Because they especially deal with people's emotions. Moreover, we cannot hold face to face meetings with these artificial gadgets. 

Finally, l would like to say applying the potential of artificially intelligent robots in jobs is important ,however it is better to integrate their capabilities with human knowledge to get a better outcomes.",3,5.0
"Some countries have high unemployment rate, so some people think that children should only go to primary school, not high school because they won't find a job later. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People without occupations are increasing; hence, people suppose that children solely need to study until high school. From my perspective, I am totally against this viewpoint and will elaborate on some reasons to justify this stance.

First and foremost, the primary rationale would appear to be better growth. That is to say, when children possess more opportunities to access  education, they can develop all aspects of their mental and physical health. It means that they can study some subjects, typically math, gymnastics, and science. Therefore, they can boost their brains to acquire new information and have sufficient knowledge for working in the future and enhance their major competence with top-notch initiatives.

Furthermore, another motive relates to higher soft skills. To be more specific, they not only broaden their horizons but also receive a variety of meaningful lessons and experiences pertaining to strange situations. Moreover, if they are taught for a longer time, they will meet some practical behaviours and then know how to apply their expertise to solve difficult circumstances. As a result, they know the ways to go through ups and downs as well as obstacles. For example, they are educated in good communication abilities to team up with their peers in order to obtain the best results in their work. From that, young generations effortlessly implement these things for their career later and reach their summit of professions. 

In conclusion, it would be logical to conclude that giving up going to high school should be rejected by virtue of better growth and higher soft skills. In fact, higher education should be advocated because of its numerous merits for future work.",8,7.5
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about community work. However, whether teenagers spend their leisure time for community works, it has benefits for themselves and society or not has caused an argument. From my perspective, I totally agree that it has numerous advantages for both.

Firstly, it is clear that doing community work in spare time has lots of benefit for themselves in several sides, for example, they can improve their social and teamwork skills because they must work with many people from different family, therefore, it has different ways to interact with distinct people. Moreover, they can manage conflict and negotiate with other people because almost all of works will have some problems and working with others can cause a little argument due to different opinion.

Second, doing community works have a lot of advantages for society in many ways because community will have people who full of energy, then they can do many things for community. For instance, they can solve trash problem by picking up trash on the street and sidewalks and create campaign to leave garbage in the right places, it seems just a little thing but if there are many people doing this it can cause a huge effect for this problem. 

In summary, teenagers doing community work in their leisure time has lots of benefit for themselves and society. Meanwhile, government should support them for do this thing as much as possible by promote community works. By doing so, people will be raised awareness of community work importance.",5,6.0
"In some couintries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 


What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Nowadays,  some countries have increased interest in the searching for their own house past.From some point of view, I can say that it is obvious to be curious about their house or building. Because those are their physical and mental shelter and keep. I would like to discuss  the reason for this trend and how the people research information about their houses.

 Firstly, housing is one of the human's basic needs to survive. Thus, it means a lot to many  people.

In addition, some of the houses are descended from their ancestors therefore they have histories and memories of family. Moreover, the owners and  tenants need to know was there a fire or any damage by hurricanes for preventation. Furthermore, some real estate properties' values are higher than your expectation because of their authenticity and history. For instance, the owner who lived a few centuries ago fought for the independence of the nation or a well-known politician.

 Secondly, there are many methods of researching the history of their property such as searching on the internet, asking neighbours, and visiting  local real estate agents and libraries. Frankly, searching on the internet is the easiest and fastest way to get information. However, the information found on the internet may not include  crucial to minor information and in the worst case not even exist. Therefore, visiting real estate agents and libraries has more possibility to not miss any information as it is a more live source.

 To conclude, your home or any kind of building property may have attractive history and while you are in research you could find various fun factors about your house or building.",5,6.0
In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these change happen. What's your opinion about it.,"There are no difference between man and women. Because women are more self employed and confident. They prove their ability in traditionally man dominated jobs.  In this essay we will discuss the reason for  change.                                                                    The first reason is that women are getting more opportunity. Nowadays, women have started working outside the home In many countries. And it is clear that they are able to do jobs which were traditionally only held by man. Secondly, today women are more educated than past and they are going for higher education. Therefore, higher positions in any company, low, politics and many other field can be held by women.                                Moreover, today anyone is trained to do any type of work. People do not give importants to gender differences. In other words we can say that women may be  stronger than men, while some male individuals may be more sensitive than women, and more caring about their families than women.                                              On other hand, in past women worked in their home. Even, girls were not allowed to go to school in many places. Fortunately, if they allowed to work, they could do only sensitive work like teachings, nursing and social work. But now men and women both have trained in their work with their own abilities. They both walk shoulder  to shoulder.                          To sum up, now women are proving their self in many ways. That's why they are taking those jobs which are traditionally done by men.",0,<4
Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The is a common belief that students’ focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results. However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.
On the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals. For instance, in China, over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field. Students can apply to those schools when they turn 15. According to a statistic from one of the business schools, 70% of their students received high scores in the national exam.
Nevertheless, a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence. Students can student various knowledge from different aspects, they can choose the subject they are interested in most. Moreover, students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university. Numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself. Students are motivated to do their best. For example, over 90% of students at the Norway University claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university. They have a full idea of what they like and dislike. They found that school life is excited and full of happiness.
To sum up, it is apparent that students can be well-developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices, however, it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests.",6,6.5
Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is a heated discussion about whether humans should take actions to protect the species from the impact of human activities. Although it is argued by some people that it is too late to take any action on this problem, I hold the opinion that we can still adopt effective measures to improve this situation.

Some people believe that the negative impact that humans have exerted over the ecological system is irreversible. Thus little outcome can be seen if action is taken from now on. For example, the breakthroughs that humans have achieved in genetic science cannot bring extinct species back to life. Moreover, genetically modified organisms might affect biodiversity, and the possible knock-on effect is yet to be foreseen. In this case, the action that aims to protect the species is neglectable. 

However, I would argue that effective and timely measures are pivotal in protecting plants and animal species from further harm. If people stop burning coal and fossil fuels and alter to renewable energy, then we are more likely to avert global temperature rising up to an unprecedented level, and more species are able to survive because of that. If we start enhancing people's awareness of protecting wildlife, then communities are more likely to work collaboratively in to conserving endangered species. Thus, the negative impacts of human activities on species can be reversed.

In summary, while it is true that it is too late to rectify some of the damage that humans have imposed on plants and animal species, I would argue that effective measures should still be taken to prevent the problem from exacerbating.",7,7.0
Young people often influenced in their behaviors and situations by others in the same age. This is called peer pressure. Do the disadvantages of this outweigh its advantages.,"Influencing plays vital role in everyone's life and most of the masses from young age are often influence by their same age people. Although, it have several advantages yet it also have some disadvantages. This essay describes both sides.

Teenagers learn more from those who are in similar age because they fell more confident in front on them as compared to teachers or parents. Also,they can share everything with each other including personal matters without any kind of shyness,moreover, young students learn easily and faster due to peer pressure which help in their academics. For instance, according to the survey of 'Times of Japan' 90% school school students perform better because they study with their same age friends during the lockdown period. This happens because students who are shy in class,they feel free to ask anything with their friends.

However, sometimes things goes wrong and the reason is peer pressure because sometimes youngest join wrong group as a consequence,they lost right track. Apart from this, In this technology world, most of the students spend their time with social  media sites and when they influence from their influencer they quite studies in between and try to do those things which the influencer done in his life without as research and they face failure and the cause is peer pressure.

In summary, peer pressure has both merits and demerits but, its disadvantages do not outweigh its advantages. Because its cons seen in rare cases.",1,4.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agre or disagree?,"Nowadays, people are more social and dedicated to helping each other as compared to past decades. Also, prefer to do unpaid jobs when they are free from their work. This essay will discuss why I totally agree with the trend which has various benefits for both youngsters and the community.

To begin with, First of all, as  fresher most graduates do not have permanent jobs and after completing unpaid jobs, they will get not only references but also experience for their better career, therefore they can easily get their paid employment. Moreover, they can also get some certificates for their services and the opportunity to meet with persons who are working in senior posts in organizations. Thus, teenagers will have broader horizons.    

Moreover, the same trend is also helpful to our humanity as well, because most  Trusts and NGOs do not have sufficient amount to complete their tasks for the welfare of  society. So with the help of various unpaid ,employees they can save lots of money which can be used for other works such as  providing food and shelters to needy people. Moreover, individuals are more socially connected with other people by providing their free services because at that time they are not doing their work for only money. Hence, it creates a bonding between the people in the world. 

To sum up, I would like to restate my vista as I am in total agreement with the same trend attracting more youngsters for the well-being of the community and providing lots of credentials to new graduates for their better future.",7,7.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even criticism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is sometimes argued that students should give feedback to their teachers to raise the quality of education in high schools, while others believe that it will disrespectful. In this paper, I would discuss both points of view in-depth and present examples to show why the first assertion is more compelling.

Those who advocate for making comments lead to losing students' respect and discipline to their teachers agreed that feedback they give is impractical and unfavourable in many ways. To be more precise, some comments from students are not constructive to improve a fully work-out lesson. For example, they will have more opportunities to criticise their teachers through rude speeches because of receiving reprimands from their teachers before. Moreover, they could have violent behaviour by virtue of criticism they made which could increase the rate of crime in the future.

On the other hand, proponents of giving feedback concur that these activities could give more chances for students to perform their thoughts and knowledge. In many terms, students could recommend what their teachers need to attend, which could help their teachers achieve their comments and teach better lessons. For instance, in Vietnam, there are feedback forms in the last lesson for students to tick what grade they mark for their teachers and make comments. Thus, educational people will receive the average score and improve their teaching skills through that comments.

In conclusion, I believe that encouraging high school students give feedback to their professors has many advantages such as performing their thoughts and knowledge, despite some conflicting opinions that they will be disrespectful because of impractical and unfavourable comments.",7,7.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment. In my opinion, there are plenty of reasons for this issue. However, I strongly believe that we could take some measures to solve this problem.

There are numerous reasons why an increase in manufacturing activities can cause damage to natural habitats. First and foremost, as more goods are produced, the number of wastes and exhaust fumes increases. For example, in the manufacturing process, more toxic wastes and emissions are released from factories to nature, which leads to two serious environmental problems including water pollution and air pollution, causing the death of many animal species. Secondly, most food is sold in non-biodegradable plastic packing. However, these products are very hard to decompose and can remain for thousands of years. As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats.

Nevertheless, individuals and governments can join hands to mitigate the problem. Governments could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories. In addition, they should invest in renewable energy. Take European Union as an example, they comply with a regulation that allows countries to buy carbon credits, ban plastic bags, and encourage renewable energies such as solar and wind power. Moreover, individuals should also try to be greener. In other words, each person should choose products with less packaging and recycle as much as possible, which helps save energy and raw materials. 

In conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem.",8,7.5
"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Sometimes, people argue that interview is not an efficient way to select the employee and believes that there are more useful process. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that Interview is a reliable method than other techniques.

First of all, I believe that recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential employees by the Viva. In the interviews, there is face to face interaction and candidates have to answer unprepared questions, from which personality quality can be judged. In other words, it also helps the companies in determining whether the information employees have included in their resume is true or not. As a result, the candidate gets the opportunity to express what he can do for the company.

Secondly, in my opinion interview is a good technique for selecting applicants. This process enables the company to quickly estimate candidate’s capability and make an informed selection decision. However, people believe that there are other selection methods with various advantages. One of the common technique is written test, which focuses on judging the theoretical knowledge of the applicant. But this process can be more time consuming as compared to viva.

To conclude, I strongly believe that interview is more better than other techniques of choosing whom to employ because by following this process, companies can get good and deserving candidates for their organization.",0,<4
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","A high number of traffic is a major issue in most of the big cities and towns all of the planet earth. The main reasons this happens is a big figure of vehicles on the roads and the viable solution is to increase  the public transportation facilities. 

The increased amount of private automobiles is one the main causes of huge traffic. It is very easy to buy a new car because of the bank's loan scheme and instalment payment and people are buying too many of them. As the number of vehicles is increasing, however,  the roads are not. As per the study, every contemporary metropolis need twenty five percentages of its land area for roads which is not a common practice in most countries. As a result, people are spending too much time on commuting. For example, capital city Manila in the Philippines, where it takes more than four hours to travel around twelve kilometres.

To tackle this problem the government should implement a better public transportation system as well as rules on buying new cars and more taxes while driving in a major metropolitan area. Most of the cities do not a modern transportation infrastructure and people totally rely on personal vehicles. As per the latest survey in the Philippines, people think if the metro railway was good, they would not take out their cars in the capital. In addition to the modernization of the public transport, the government should impose rules on buying more than one car per house as well as include high taxes while driving in the city centre. For example, we could talk about Singapore and the U.K. In Singapore, people need an approval for the authority before buy a vehicle and in the U.K people pay extra tax when they drive in London. Both countries have a minimum level of traffic mess.

In conclusion, big and contemporary cities of the world are having traffic issues because of the high registration of new automobiles and less  number of roads to support this demand, but it can be solved by the implementation of the public transport system and taxes on buying a new car and driving in the city.",8,7.5
Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.
In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.",7,7.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's society, cooperation is considered a fundamental value, reason why needs to be taught since at a young age. However, it is argued that the best path to promote teamwork is through sports at school. I fully agree with who believes that to reach an higher standard of partnership is necessary employing physical activities.

On the one hand, competitive games are not the soley way to show the effects of collaboration. In fact, different methods can be apply, such as partner pupils up for a project or assignement, so that they will promptly realized that working together will enhance their knowledge, helping them to achieve the common aim. They will soon understand that each of them brings various strength in to the group that should be utilized at their adavantage. Although assigning students group homework, which tests their cooperational skills and illustrates them the benefit gained out of it, I think that teaching this value through corporal excercises is more effective.

The results of any kind of sports, from a single player to couple or vast team, are depending on a main attitude: collaboration. If scholars are open to partner with coach or colleague, greater outcome can be obtained. Physical activities offer a deep insight on how working together can help to ease the attainment of goals, sustaining and pushing each other for improvement. Furthermore, it teaches the lesson of not giving up, due to the responsabilities and duty toward their peers.

To conclude, more path can be followed to show students how to cooperate, but I firmly believe that the best method is through team sports at school.",3,5.0
Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters suppose that for candidates, soft skills are more crucial than academic background. I totally agree with this notion as social abilities are the bottom line when getting jobs.

Firstly, being equipped with interpersonal skills such as communicating and interacting with co-workers helps job applicants to discuss with others and figure out solutions in any type of working environment. Hence, even a newbie who does not much specialized knowledge can contribute to solving and accomplishing assignments. Although academic capabilities play vital roles in the working process, they might become less effective in teamwork tasks requiring novel ideas from different perspectives if individuals are not able to connect with other colleagues in the workplace.

Secondly, the ability to multitask is also important in people’s careers, especially in these days and ages when everything happens fast and simultaneously. If a worker is merely good at technical knowledge, he might be confused due to a lack of capability to complete different tasks constantly. Consequently, he will become overwhelmed by heavy workloads with tight deadlines then. For instance, in the advertising field, being able to handle many tasks is always prioritized as the employees have to monitor campaigns, make new plans and meet clients’ requests at the same time and their performance outcomes will be evaluated based on all the aforementioned scopes as opposed to solely professional knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the undeniable importance of candidates’ educational backgrounds, I believe that being good at soft skills such as communication or multitasking is crucial in people’s careers since it can help them to improve not only individual results but also collective outcomes.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this?","With the development of human society, there are plenty of crowds who are attracted by discovering the past behind the houses or building they live in. There are two main reasons accounting for this phenomenon, which can hopefully provide several effective explanations.

There are two main causes for this situation. First, it is a pleasure for the community to notice the story behind their houses. The human society is undergoing a huge increase in recent years. As a result, there is only a little chance for an apartment to have a long past. The finding process is more like finding treasures and the result in various, which can offer a sense of adventure. This can bring joy to the public. Second, it can make an extra value for the house. The history behind a house, for instance,  a celebrity used to live here or some event that happened  can bring extra cultural value. Thus, the house owners can rent or sell the house to people interested in this and gain more benefit in financial part.

On the other hand, the most effective way to notice the history of the house is by using the internet. Internet technic has become the database of daily usage. Therefore, people can check the information by typing a few words and clicking the button, which is very convenient and quick. Furthermore, people can ask their elder neighbours. Sometimes, the elderly may live in a constant place for a long period, they may have some event that occurred before which is little known.

In conclusion, extra income and a sense of the unknown is the main motivation of people and asking people living nearby and searching on the internet are the two methods people can research.",8,7.5

While,a group of people believe that it is education purpose to use museum not to entertain. However, both the views are discussed further. My inclination is justified in ensuing paragraphs.

      Discussing on the first view, people are believes museum for entertain purpose. They enjoyable moment for so the antique items as well as many more about how to lives past life ? In addition, museum are place for interest to collect the old item last few decades by younger generation attract the collection of past history and enjoying their moment.

        On the other hand, there are more benefits to education. So, another group of people believe some museum is only education purpose not entertain. In addition, history about the information of last decade activities. nowadays many competitive exam are focused on a history of nations. To exemplify, khushi is a preparing the government exam. Therefore, they have more knowledge about history also they known Many collection of item to store particular museum.

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your Opinion?","In this current day and age, science has improved the way we work and pursue different tasks. computerization has advanced in the last decade to make certain tasks easy as well as efficient. While some people do believe that eventually all jobs will be performed by robots and others believe the right time has not arrived yet. In my opinion, jobs which put human life in danger should help of automation.

To begin with, science has always made things easier for modern civilization. Moreover, certain tasks do require a degree of perfection as well as accuracy which is better than the human efforts. Robots are a means of long-term investment by big corporates to reduce the labour cost along with incidents such as union strike. For example, financial data of the top 30 companies in Japan shows a significant improvement in financials with the handling of robots. Hence, it is evident that use mechanization is for the better of society.

In addition, certain work environments have a higher rate of injuries which puts the employee's life in danger. Furthermore, safety together with efficiency has improved drastically with the use of automation. For instance, a survey suggests that work injuries are reduced by 60% in environments where artificial intelligence is used. Consequently, machines can be used to save time and avoid injuries.

To conclude, I believe that automation will soon replace all the major jobs. Also, to imagine a world without modern science and technology would be difficult. Corporations should include programmes to educate employee's about the benefits of AI.",11,9.0
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Nowadays 2 groups of people have different opinions about the importance of art courses in school. The first belief  is, it is vital and the second belief is, it is waste of time, however, my opinion is close to the first group.

On the one hand, some people think art is such a time killer for school children due to the accumulation of time for other important courses, for instance, mathematics, geography and so on. Besides, maybe they might think art could be a distraction for their heir and catch their concentration, for example, if math and art are planned for Saturday, the children have not got enough focus on math.

On the other hand, the second group thinks art should be imperative and it is essential for school children. In my point of view, art is essential because it can lead to a great impact on scion creativity. heir in school ages are in the most part of their life, school is not only a place just teach heir academic skills but also it is a place for enhancing offspring sociable skill.

"Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than negative ones, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","As the famous saying goes, children are the future of tomorrow. They are ought to have few responsibilities towards the society. But these days, they are often laden with increased duties. From my perspective, inculcating children with responsibilities help them in becoming good citizens. The essay will discuss both the positive and negative impacts of the practice.

To commence with, forcing adolescents to carry extra duties on their shoulders has its own negative effects. Firstly, this might create an extra burden on them. As a result, it can lead to stress and other related problems at a young age. This is illustrated by the commonly seen anger and irritation in kids nowadays, severely affecting their developing brains. Finally, adolescents would not be able to enjoy their childhood happily and freely.  

On the other side, there are a noteworthy number of productive effects associated with this practice. First of all, making young ones carry extra liabilities on their back make them better and responsible human beings in future. This further helps them to become more socially and morally responsible. In addition, it will help in shaping their character as well as moral behaviour and ethics. For instance, the parents who teach their kids to be more responsible towards helping needy people, saving money, studies, country, etc., are able to watch their kids rise and become respected citizens in the offing. 

To summarise, having children to bear more responsibilities from young age, bring ethical values in them and makes their future brighter and therefore, they become respected and responsible citizens of the country. Thus, from my viewpoint, the positive effects of the practice out-shadows the negative impacts.",8,7.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is no secret that some celebrities are more renowned for their luxurious lifestyles than for their attainments, and they have a detrimental impact on young generation. While I agree with this assertion in most cases, I also support that there are several well-known people who act as positive models for juveniles.

On the one hand, the main reason why I espouse this notion is that many celebrities are famous due to their glory and reputation which are not attained by hard work. To illustrate, these kinds of people regularly attend extravagant parties and festivities. In addition, they tend to appear on magazine headlines by demonstrating their flamboyant clothes, grandiose mansions and expensive cars. A prime example of this is Jennifer Lopez because of her glamorous daily life. She often displays her fashion, cars and villas for publicity. For this reason, youngsters suppose that profile is better than a good manner, without pondering its background. Hence, it is believed that this lifestyle can affect juveniles in a negative way.

On the other hand, some celebrated individuals’ prominence is a fruit of their strong determination and great ambition. In other words, these people are a proof that accomplishing objectives is a viable avenue to become prominent in their chosen fields, so all of us hold them in high regard for their success. For instance, Lionel Messi is one of the highest-paid football players in the world. Indeed, he stated in his biography two years ago that he applied himself to develop his real skills in order to be the most talented soccer player. Therefore, he is extremely inspirational for young adults, and they perceive him as an idol. Hence, these types of luminaries can promote children to improve their aptitudes. 

To conclude, it is true that nowadays a lot of famous people obtain fame from lavish lifestyles instead of their accomplishments, and it sets a bad example for children. However, I believe that celebrities who are famous for their successful careers and great talents impress juveniles positively. Given this condition, it is recommended that renowned people should alter their way of life to be good role models with their meaningful achievements.",6,6.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Undoubtedly, these days, people have to find a way to better weather conditions. It is often argued that people are able to adapt themselves to climate alterations, but it lasts for thousand years and this is while climate change for people is extremely more comfortable than adapting themselves to this situation, which is unimaginable difficult and time-consuming. I fully agree with this fact that it is better for people to change climate and not to try to reconcile themselves with this situation. In turn, this essay will discuss ways to alter climate by people.
    On the one hand, the more people cultivate trees, the more the weather will be cleaned. That is to say that trees are unthinkably capable to absorb the CO2 (carbon dioxide), which in high concentrations can damage human body cells and eventually leads to cell death, and this is while that trees can absorb carbon dioxide and easily convert it to oxygen, which is incredibly useful for everything in the world. For instance, in forest countries, where the number of trees are a lot, several kinds of cancer such as breast, brain, chest and stem cell cancers are extremely rare. In my opinion, enhancement of cultivated trees can secure the survival of planet Earth. To sum up, tree cultivation can help people to change the climate, significantly.    
    On the other hand, the more people use fossil fuels, the higher increased weather temperature will happen. That is to say that consumption of fossil fuels is able to increase the atmospheric pollutants as well as the weather temperature causing several damages of environment such as increased melting icebergs and fires. For example, in the recent decade, which the weather temperature of the world became warmer by up to 2 oC, the rate of fires over the world increased by up to 12%. I believe that consumption of fossil fuels must be reduced by humans to decreased atmospheric pollutants happen. To conclude, people have to decrease the consumption of fossil fuels, significantly. Alongside these contents, in some situations, people can adapt themselves with difficult environmental conditions.
    Some people are of the opinion that modification of climate change is possible. In this way, they declare that enhancement of cultivated trees and reduction of used fossil fuels can help people to propel the climate changes to desired side. I am sure that several different ways are accessible to help people to change the climate.",4,5.5
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.
In conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children.",11,9.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this contemporary society, young individuals tend to inludulge on their smart devices on laisure time rathar then outdoor sports. Although, some believe teaching chldren how to cooperate through team sports is best way. I stongly agree to this perspective, largely due to the positive impact on mental development and physical wellbeing. In this essay I will explore the optimistic outcome of this act.

Fristly, children who play sports at their educational institute can exacerbate understanding with other student. Game such as soocer and crecket or even most of the game demands a team perticipation where individuals need to build bound with other player for optimal outcome on the feilds. Moreover, any kind of miscomunication could detrimentally effact on the whole team. For this instences, if student prolong thier friendship on playground, they will also create a good comunication on their classroom which will also construct a batter attachment with the teachers as well . A good understanding skills is cruticial step for learning cooperation.

On the other hand, being engaged on game that need physical involvement not only create batter understanding but also develop a leadership mentality. On the feild, athlete are responsible for their own action and their endeavors reflacts possibily of wining for the whole team. In order to , a student become use to be aware for their step which also reflect on their future ventures . For this example, that awerness capibility that children make in their schiools, playes important role to evolve their maturity. Playing in front of oppnent and handling situation with maturity a good sign of leadersip, also demonstrate a good collaboration knowledge.

In conclusion, team sports convay a vital role for a children's development, and schools are remain only place where they can actively involve with these physical activity. However, In my opinion I compleately agree that schools is the place where young people can learn cooperation through team sports.",1,4.0
Some people believe that climate affects the person’s way of life while others believe that climate has greater impact on the economy of a region. Discuss both view and give your opinion?,"Climate is a long-term pattern of weather phenomenon in one particular geographical region. Several individuals deem that one’s lifestyle has been affected by climate; whereas  other mindsets reckon, it has a significant influence on a country’s economical conditions. In my opinion, both  notions have valid points to support. Various reasons behind accepting these perspectives are explained explicitly in the following paragraph.

To commence with, climatic conditions help to shape people’s lives in one place in many ways. Depending upon it, residents are compelled to put on daily outfits. If the weather remains cold, someone will wear warm clothes and vice versa. To illustrate, inhabitants residing in cold mountainous regions often cover themselves with jackets, woollen sweaters and boots; while, people living in tropical zones require light-tinted cotton or linen fabrics. Moreover, food choices are also determined by precipitation. Where an ample amount of rainfall and sunlight is available, irrigation and cultivation practices can be done. Not only does it assist to cultivate crops but also brings diversity. In extreme climatic situations, these processes are not feasible. The Mediterranean region is known as the “fruit basket” of the world, because winter rain helps to grow a variety of exotic fruits, for instance.

 In addition, the contribution of temperature to a nation’s economy is indispensable. A diverse range of phenomena associated with this has direct dominance on financial progress. If a place receives adequate rainfall and temperature, agricultural practices will flourish. Farming can support the province’s food security as well as that realm will be able to export the extra output, which must boost the economy by generating foreign revenue. Furthermore, when a nation will have subsistence agriculture, then there will be no requirement of importing food items from another land. It can save a massive capital. However, unforeseen calamities or natural disasters can have a detrimental impacts also. For example, the Indian economy greatly depends upon monsoon rain, which aids to strengthen it. 

To recapitulate, I am a firm believer in the fact that both  views are absolutely correct. Each parameter of weather plays a crucial role in everyone’s life. As a consequence, all should try to put individual effort to prevent climate change in order to obtain the goal of developing healthier pursuits.",6,6.5
"Men and women are different in term of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","It certainly cannot be denied that men and women are different in terms of their references and capabilities. Therefore, some jobs are better done by men and others by women. I definitely agree with this situation.  The reasons for this are twofold. 

First and foremost, it is vitally important that nowadays, there are various types of jobs. Some of them are better done by men than construction, and mining. Opposing to this other jobs are well done by women. For instance, taking care of children at kinder gardens or like babysitters. Women cannot do difficult, hard work and men cannot do work that belongs to  women. It is my belief that everyone should do work that is suitable for them. 

Secondly and more importantly there are some jobs that cannot be imagined  without men or women. One of them is a professional artist. Another  kind of job is as  a singer. We cannot imagine these occupations without men or ladies. Moreover, the government need both genders of workers. Ladies are necessary to clean and cook as employers. Of course, ladies cannot be butchers or construction workers, however, some women work as skilled-craftsman by force. This is a sorrowful situation in the world. Furthermore, our country tries to multiply our homeland with workers such as businessmen and employers. 

By way of my conclusion, I believe that this issue is likely to become even more important in the future as borders between countries become increasingly blurred. It, therefore, demands  further consideration.",7,7.0
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the indivi,"pinions are divided as to whether adolescents should spend their leisure time on helping the local community without payments or not. Some hold a belief that it merits not only individually but also socially. Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.

For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to force young students to do unpaid works for the local in their school break. Firstly, teenagers are at the age of learning and they have to meet quite a lot of deadlines for homework. If they take time out to do unrelated jobs, there will not be time left for their study and some other activities for the comprehensive development, such as doing extra - curriculum activities, playing sport and so forth. Therefore, occupying their little free time is obviously not proper and unfair. Secondly, teenagers may not be physically strong enough and lack the necessary labor skills. This may easily lead to unwanted accidents at workplaces. Finally, the local residents are able to ask for help from diverse resources even without any effort rather than taking advantage of the young, and it may yield a much better result.

 

In my opinion, adolescents who help their community as a workforce do not benefit from what they do and they even will be the low-quality employees in the future society. In fact, learning is the most effective way of generating a well-educated workforce for the contemporary economy and educating good citizens for a healthy society. Case in point, in numerous parts of Vietnam, the young aged around 15 to 20 are considering making ends meet top priority, and this situation is originating the fact that they are not qualified and skillful enough as requirements of most enterprises. As a result, their applications were denied because of lacking a sense of discipline and labor skills.

In conclusion, the choice of whether helping the local or not belongs to teenagers, but I believe that we should not require them to do works which are others' responsibility.",5,6.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single –sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
 To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, in most countries, parents have the opportunity to send their children either to single –sex  or coeducational schools, however, it is considered by some that sending children to single –sex school  has drawbacks in the future. In my opinion, I believe that studying in single-sex school does not have any effect on a child’s future. Moreover,  it enhances gender specific skills and builds their confidence  which is essential  later in life.
Firstly, studing particularly in same gender school boosts gender specific skills.These skills are specific to the child’s gender for instance, in girls' schools they are more keen to learn  specific skills such as crafting, drawing, whereas in boys' schools, boys will be more interested in sports, such as swimming, cricket. Theses skills depend on gender specific interests as well as their physical capacities. Moreover, learning these skills in schools specifically for girls and boys will prepare for competition within their own sex. Some children can take these skills as profession later in their lives.
Furthermore, same sex schools' boosts confidence in children. As there  are differences in the physical abilities between boys and girls, so  judging them in competition of physical abilities will always lead boys towards winning, the same can be the case with girls as they mature  faster than boys so their competition in class will lead girls. Thus, they can lose their confidence. Equality is important for confidence as it inculcates fare standards of competition.Hence, single sex- schools can boost their confidence in the long run.  
In conclusion,  single –sex schools does not hinder child’s growth in future,Furthermore enhances their confidences and skills.",5,6.0
Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this era of 21st-century the environment's health is depleting continously. We all know the reason behind this problem is human greed.
Our ailing planet is diminishing in health beacuse of human's unlimited wants. For instance, increase in demand for electricity has left our environment in unhealthy condition. The air, water, etc are poluted these days. Rising wants of fuel as a source of energy is polluting environment. Environmentlist argue that use of such fuel must be stopped by the government, and the use of  eco-friendly fuels such has CNG and LPG must be enhanced by government through advertisements. Whereas some people believe that by rising the prices of the fuel will help economy to decrease in the demand for the fuel, but this is not the correct way of doing this. The demand of fuel is inelastic that is it is unaffected by the rise in price. This is because cars using these fuels are cheaper and people go for buying these cars. So, this will have no effect on the rising price of the fuel. Over and above, richer and wealthy section of the population will go for these fuel only.  So, according to me this problem cannot be solved through this remedy. 
Out and out , every lock has its own key. This problem has its own solution that is we can only save our environment with advertisements and creating awareness in mind of people.",0,<4
"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this has set a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Presently famous public figures are more known for their luxurious lifestyle and richness than their talents and performances, which negatively influences the younger genesis. I entirely agree that famous personalities are a bad influence. In the subsequent paragraphs, I shall explain how famous big names set bad examples for young people. 

 Firstly, some big shots are only famously known for their richness and attractive lifestyle, and often it adversely affects the psyche of the younger adults. They make you think it is mandatory to look graceful and must buy expensive products. Their acting skills might be mediocre, but they have become a sensation through the public display of their materialistic wealth and charming lifestyle. At times these  end up engaging in habits like smoking, excessive drinking, or drugs, which negatively influence the younger person.  

Additionally, someone has a harmful effect on the self-esteem of young people. personage commonly display and associate beauty with perfect bodies. When youths see that, they want to look like them. While trying to imitate them and grow thin, teenagers  develop eating disorders. Also, dissatisfaction among minors with live-like heroes often leads to seriously negative health consequences.  Besides the fact that certain good bigwigs like Bill Gates and Ratan Tata inspire  to  juvenile achieve their goals through hard work and dedication, there is a significant majority of superstars who is hypocritical.  

To sum up, famous big shots do negatively influence the youth through their public display of wealth and unhealthy habits which harm the mental health of the childhood.",7,7.0
"Some people think that robots are very important to human’s future development, while others think they are dangerous and have negative effects on society.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In this digital age, the development of robots become increasingly massive with the advancement of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) system which lead some people to argue that robots are essential in future human civilization. Meanwhile, others believe that robot devices can bring threats for humanity. The following essay will elaborate those views in detail.

On one hand, robots can help our life much easier and manageable. For instance, robots can assist to do the household tasks with a voice recognition instruction or a regularly scheduled-tasks using smartphone. Activating synchronization in our robotic devices at home using Google assistance also a smart way to enable human gives control and command even in distance, also ensure everything done on schedule, for example automatically mop the floor at 8 am everyday even we are outside home.

On the other hand, robotic devices have a greater risk to produce errors and various forms of crime which one of them is deep fake AI. Nowadays, the development of Artificial Intelligence intrigues illegal authorities to create fake and manipulative videos imitating well-known figures to damaged their reputation. Deepfake technology can create fictional photos or videos which now being used as a weapon against women for photo/video-based pornographic businesses online.  Therefore, this can affect the victims physically, psychologically, and economically.

 In conclusion, beside the advantages of the existence of robotic devices, robots are dangerous for human as they can be utilized for numerous purposes including malpractice and other criminal activity by irresponsible individuals. However, as long as we keep the data privacy and security, robots can give much benefits in life.",4,5.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding  out about the history of the house or building they live in.  What are the reasons for this?  How can people research this?","In our rather futuristic society for a number of reasons people are getting more interested in the  past of their hometowns. With the help of rapidly ameliorating technology their desire to learn  about the history can be easily put into life. But what are the roots of such  eagerness?  First of all, the hectic lifestyle that we all experience nowadays does not leave any space for  calmness and peace in our souls, so most of the people - especially adolescence - are struggling  with finding their feet, whilst having a broad spectrum of knowledge about the world around really  gives a feeling of confidence in the impermanence of life. In addition to this, it is said that being  aware of the past you can change the future. Consequently, if people want to live a better life in more comfortable environment, they have to explore the history of their homes in order not to  repeat past mistakes.  For this aims we are lucky to have multiple tools to carry out research into the subject. Despite  libraries being considered as an old-fashioned and not necessarily convinient approach of learning,  there are actually quite a few books and magazines which are not available online but which are  extremely helpful when it comes to the local interests. News, photos, articles and interviews with  different people published in old magazines indeed provide with a clear image of past events.  Brousing the internet forums is also a great idea to find new information and make friend with  mutual objectives.  Putting everything into a nutshell, learning about the history of your place not only builds a sense  of confidence but also might have a big impact on our future way of life,",1,4.0
"In recent years, ''responsible tourists'' have paid attention to preserving both culture and environment of the places they visit.

By this ,situation tourists are full everywhere, and they also make some problems to visit the site. Hence, lots of people advise these tourists to protect the environment and the places they visit, but some others say that is impossible. In my opinion, if you want that is not very hard to finish.

Although when people visit this site, it is already had some destroyed to the places, we can by protect everything around the places to reduce the hurt that we make.

People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"The prevalence of environmental issues has been a growing concern in the past few years. Many people believe that the cost of fuel for vehicles should be increased to tackle this problem. While I consider that this might be an alternative solution, I would argue that there are still some measures should be contributed greater impact.

If the national authorities raise the taxes on petrol, this will address two environmental issues. Firstly, in terms of the private cars and vehicles, this policy reduces the limitation of the number cars in the roads by motorists. This leads to the decline of gas emissions into the atmosphere. Secondly, from the perspective of the government, by providing this policy creates an increase in the number of people that use public transportations. This leads to the government would be forced to upgrade and expand the infrastructure transportations which use the friendly petrol for the environment.

On the other hand, while this rise in fuel prices might be a useful stopgap measure, authorities could adopt other policies which would be more effective in the long term. From the perspective of the industrial field, state authorities could promote incentive taxes to the companies which use green power in their productions. By establishing the incentive, strategy contributes more firms changing their visions on green-house effect into the environment. Another policy would be to introduce free bus and train passes help in the effort to combat global warming. 


In conclusion, even though the increasing price on fuel for vehicles can contribute to reducing the environmental problems, I would argue that more measures have been mentioned above which can be more effective to tackle this issue.",3,5.0
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the situation about enviromental issues is getting worse. It is considered that amount of consumed fuel should be decreased by the cost of it. However, I strongly believe that increasing the price of fuel will not handle this issue and other mesuares should be required to save our planet. This essay is aimed to support this view providing relevant arguments. 

To begin with, should be mentioned that increasing the cost of petrol for all the vehicles will not solve the enviromental problem and other measures should be required. First of all, goverments should start a propoganda of recycling, because recycling is one of the best solutions of enviromental problems and air pollution. Recycling should become more popular and common between people of all ages. If people start to recycle, it will help to reduce the amount of rubbish piles everywhere. 

Another point that should also be highlighted is that some laws such as prohibition of owning cars among young people under 21 years should be accepted. People of this age category can esily change a car with a bike. It will be better not only for the enviroment, but for their health as well. By reducing the number of cars, the amout of gas emitions will be decreased as well. 

To sum up, incresing the price of fuel to tackle enviromental issues will not work in the present, because there is a great amout of people who can aforrd to pay even twice more for gas. And other ways of solving this problem should be required.",5,6.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that youngster should have responsibility to do volunteer work in their leisure time because it brings benefits for both the young and society. While there are a number of advantages of joining in campaigns for unpaid community work, I partly disagree with this notion.

On the one hand, it is true that participating in many unpaid society activities may bring many benefits for both the young and the community. From the individual perspective, youngster can develop their soft skills quickly by learning from their colleagues if they work in the campaigns. For instance, when youngster have to work in a team, where require the communication skill and the team work skill, as much as possible, they can improve and develop those skills. Additionally, from the society view, those society activities can create a high-quality workforce, who are the leader of the country, for the future. Because of those teenagers have been trained when they are very young, so their soft skills and expertise will much better.

On the other hand, spending time on unpaid community work instead of concentrating on studying can influence the young’s studies results, which is really important for their future. A host of people agree that you need to have some degrees from universities or schools, where teach you the expertise of your jobs, if you want to have a decent job. Forcing teenagers to do unpaid community work reduce their time to improve their knowledge or participate in many seminars which can open the new world and help them more active in globalization. Moreover, not anyone like to do in volunteer environment. Commanding youngster, who do not like to interact with so much strangers, called introverts, can may them get some mental illness and some of them can injured themselves as a way to reject this.

In conclusion, while doing unpaid society work can improve teenager’s soft skills and bring many benefits for community, I suggest that we can not force everyone to do this because the drawbacks are more outweigh the advantages.",5,6.0
"Figures show that some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger.

What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?","Youth plays a vital role in the growth of many nations . Today most countries reported a dramatic increase in the younger generation compared to the older ones. This essay will discuss the causes that going to account in present and future for a country because of this development.

First of all, the younger generation can make a lot of changes to a nation because they are  really  energetic and smart. To elaborate , if the younger population increases it will lead to economic growth in a nation. It is obvious that the outsourcing of foreign companies from various regions will become more interested  to open new branches in the country to acquire more talented and creative employees so that they can enhance the productivity of the corporates. Therefore, corporates provide huge salary packages to gravitate younger minds to the institution for different vacancies . Hence, it will lead to changes in the infrastructure of the cities in the nation by accounting a significant variation in every sector such as transport , health and education , eventually , it owing to a sudden rise in  economic growth.

However, in the future , the current belief and cultures of the nations will  innovate when the younger  generation  recognise other traditions are more exciting and fun than their current  culture. Thereby, it will change the entire custom , laws and lifestyle of the country . Consequently , creating new beliefs and traditions in countries. For example, in India living together custom was seen as a crime in the early days ,  Whereas nowadays the law has completely changed  by allowing citizens to do  so. In ,addition unemployment could be major and could be a major  problem for nations to concern more , because every individual will be highly educated and talented in every profession . Thereby , it will lead to huge completion in every work sector, as a  result , major people.will be unemployed in the future.

"Public health is becoming an urgent issue now a days. some argue that government should create nutrition ad food choice law to improve public health while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. 

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some argue that the government should be responsible for public well-being because they can influence the public to be healthy while others believe that it is a person's responsibility since nowadays it is becoming a major concern. Although others perceive that the state can influence healthy eating in people, it is still vital to rely on themselves in choosing to be healthy.

It is said to believe that the government should ensure to impose rules that encourage people to prioritize nutritious food options. They are responsible for the compliance of the public in sustaining a quality lifestyle. For instance, the food and drug administration is the agency that protects and ensures the rights to the health of Filipinos and resulting in a healthier nation. However, I believe that an individual should be responsible for maintaining good health since not everyone follows the rules of the government.

On the other hand, eating a healthy meal is a personal choice. People should be more optimistic in looking for one's welfare instead of relying on the government. Having good health is essential to avoid diseases that could cause additional expenses to people. For example, eating a balanced diet and exercising are one of the many ways on improving health which starts from a person's perspective. I believe, that a person's mindset directly impacts their way of living rather than following certain rules. 

In conclusion, public health is something that should be addressed nowadays. While others believe that the government should promote healthy food alternatives to every mankind. I believe that people should be more intuitive in selecting beneficial meals to achieve a wholesome lifestyle as the saying goes ""health is wealth and change begins within you"".",8,7.5
Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is believed by some that climate has the most significant impact on people’s lives, while others argue that the economy is the most significant factor. I believe that a good economy enables people to disregard the effects of climate and thus the economy is the overriding factor.

On the one hand, the main reason given by those who believe that climate has the greatest impact is that climate determines the variability and availability of natural resources people depend on like food, water, and energy. For example, deserts are scarcely populated because of the hot climate which leads to water scarcity. Climate influences how people live and what jobs they do. People’s lifestyle including what they eat, what clothes they wear, the type of houses they live in, all in some way or another depending upon the climate the region experiences. Similarly, ice fishing is the most common profession in cold frozen countries, while agriculture is the most common profession in warm and humid climates.

On the other hand, those who believe that economy is the principal factor say that because the economy frames the choices and decisions people make regarding work, leisure, consumption, and how much to save. For example, in rich and developed countries, people tend to spend more as the governments can provide social security in the form of pensions and free health care, while in poor countries people are more likely to save. Similarly, developed countries with good economies have a more educated workforce and thus their citizens secure better jobs, while people from poor developing countries are seen employed as labour.

In the past, I believe climate had a major impact on life, but today the impact of climate can be limited by a good economy. The biggest evidence for this can be seen in the oil-rich middle eastern countries, which have established modern cities in the middle of deserts with the help of their rich economies. Their people today have the same facilities and luxuries as available in other developed countries, despite the region’s harsh climate.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although both climate and economy impact people’s way of life, the impact of the economy is certainly more.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Ageing is one of the inevitable difficult parts of life which must be experienced by every human being in the world. Due to the advancement of the medical field, life expectancy has been raised gradually in many countries in the world including developing countries. But unfortunately, caring for the elderly population is becoming a huge problem in every corner of the globe. 

when people are getting old, they tend to develop non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Moreover, ageing will lead to memory impairment and they become dependent on others not only for their physical needs but also for psychological support as well as finance. Actually, the young generation of each family should care about the senior citizens of their family. However, in this modern world, most seniors are neglected by their offspring due to several reasons. 

Many decades ago, there was a thick bond among blood relations which connected each member in many aspects. people lived in extended families rather than nuclear households. This strong bond protected the geriatric population very well. 

In contrast, nowadays, households are scattered and each member acts individually. Parents and grandparents are not spending adequate time with their children and grandchildren due to the busy schedules of their jobs. Therefore, the relationship is split which pushes the senior citizens to a bizarre living in the latter part of life. Most of the ageing population is looked after by elders' homes or community centres. 

Some people still believe that the youngsters of each generation should take responsibility to look after their seniors and legislation should be made to ensure the safety of seniors. However, it carries a lot of pros and cons. 

But I believe that  making  good relationships among family members will teach the younger generation how to care for their parents and grandparents rather than making rules.",7,7.0
Human activities have negative effects on plants and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, when our society is in the stage of rapid transformation, a tendency to increase the number of available activities can be seen and a lot of them are considered to be harmful. It is agreed ,that people make environment suffer from these and some of the negative impacts are irreparable,however, others claim that some measures can be taken to save nature. This essay,firstly,will discuss how people's actions can influence nature in an adverse way without hope to fix it,followed by an analysis of what solutions can be suggested,before coming to a reasoned conclusion.

To begin with, some activities considered to be really dangerous for forest habitats,such as hunting. Unfortunately, the majority of people do not understand the difference between farm animals who were grown to be killed for eating purposes and the habitats of the wild environment. Moreover, some species are at the edge of extinction due to people's inappropriate behaviour. In addition, there are other types of activities which harm animals,such as feeding bread to birds,as it swells in their stomach and makes them suffer from pain,which can lead even to their death. Also, for example, weeds ,which are considered to be harmful to plants, have a positive impact on soil,because they can help to defend plants from insects,but people remove them repeatedly and it leads to a decrease in the amount of them.

On the other hand, it is extremely important to provide people with information about the consequences which their actions can cause. Furthermore, the government should make a system of high fines ,in order to defend plans and animals,because the majority of people do not understand the importance of saving nature. For example, feeding bread to birds is considered to be a good action ,as someone thinks that they help animals, nevertheless, if they knew about real outcomes,they would not do this. Thus, it is necessary to keep humanity aware of risks, so that it will be possible to avoid dangers.

To conclude, this essay agrees that some  activities make nature suffer and something is too late to change ,however, there are some measures that can be taken to prevent future harm",3,5.0

On the one hand, curiosity and emotions are two possible reasons individuals look for the history of their accommodations. Human beings always desire to discover unknowns and are emotionally attached to the place where they live because the housing environment has an immense impact on everybody's lives. Therefore, as a house is the most important place that people spend a significant time on, knowing what took place in it has considerably demanded. The financial aspect can be another reason since finding the house's age and the incidences that occurred for it can help to reduce the repairing cost or even prevent any other problems in the future. For example, when people want to buy a house, they need to know the history to ensure that the structure has not had any issues for the sake of saving money.

On the other hand, there are few easy steps to finding such information. To begin with, individuals can refer to the neighbours and ask them the questions needed, especially those who live longer in the neighbourhood. For example, households can easily inquire about the last owner or tenant. In addition, there are many websites and applications related to such information. Although accessible and providing detailed info simply by filling out some forms, they might not be free and require some small fee. Nevertheless, these websites are beneficial and worth conquering necessary background about the houses.

In conclusion, as the primary reasons mentioned, due to the numerous vital aspects of dwelling's history, more people propel to know that and nowadays, it is easy to find the data needed thanks to advanced technologies.",7,7.0
"Some people think parents should read or tell stories to children. Others think parents needn’t do that as children can read books or watch TV, movies by themselves. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Whether children should read stories alone or with the accompany of parents is a question that many parents are facing nowadays. This article will explore more on this question and share my opinion.

        Some argue that parents should keep their children accompany while they are reading books on the account that it contributes to the development of children. One notable trait of children is that they can hardly grasp the correct meaning of the book even if the content is very simple. In others words, they can hardly profit from reading books that they do not understand. This might result in children wasting their precious time for learning. By contrast, with the assistance of their parents, they might gain some insights into the story and thereby enriching the time spent on reading. In addition, it is kids’ natural to imitate their parents’ words and deeds. For this reason, if parents tell the story themselves to their children in their early days, which shows that they are intrigued by the book, then it is highly predictable that the kids will enjoy the process of reading in the future.

Others believe that this assistance from parents in reading can affect the development of children. It is  common knowledge that independence is a curial ability of a human being and can only be instilled into children at a very young age. More specifically, children whose parents constantly help them with reading at a young age are more likely to show reliance toward their parents in terms of reading later. What’s more, not having children read books alone might deprive children of the opportunity to explore their interests. It is undeniable that children hardly change their minds if they have a vision of something. Consequently, once parents have failed to pinpoint the interests of their children and cannot provide books accordingly, a stereotype towards books will be formed. This might result in children do not favour reading. [40 minutes] Therefore, it is reasonable that some parents insist on not reading the story out loud for their children.

To conclude, while some argue that parents should help children to read, others maintain that otherwise contribute to cultivating independence. From my perspective, it is vital to see whether the child has the ability to read alone, if not, parents should do their best to help kids to fully understand the book.",10,8.5

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","craft is Known as better formal to explain feelings, thoughts and emotions on a small portion with a big message , nowadays some minded individuals thought that it is a waste of time whereas others think it as a great opportunity, but in my ,perspective everybody's not Capable to afford basic tools required for the profession , whereas these type of action needs more efforts. On the ,contrary it  helps to make the mind creative

To commence with, why craft exercise is not essential , because it demands more effort.  In detail working as an artist requires continuous efforts on Small Scale and one has to work in brief. for ,instance around  60% of their from primary schools love drawing as they grew up they get to know about details of each and everything , so working in detail requires more hard work and consumes more time.  scion get easily distracted if they do not have any mentor to motivate them 

Secondly , not anybody can afford most of the tools and they are not easily available to people  , for instance  working as a sketch artist one has to   purchase the various  type of Pencils and special papers for making a sketch and these Products are only available in  big cities  so those who live in a rural area may not afford it , whereas some families live in weak financial conditions if they try to afford these products for their offspring there basic needs would not be fulfilled

on the contrary , Such craft enterprise help scion to sharpen their mind and made them creative. , ,furthermore profession does not have an endpoint, one can draw anything from its own thought to express any feeling ,for instance,  Leonardo Davinci the well-known artist who had drawn a famous Painting the Monalisa, most of the researchers trying to figure  out the main aim  of the profession. at last, offspring can learn how to  express their feelings 

In nutshell, Such a type of action  would not help in future because  it requires a big motive. whereas anybody is  not capable to pursue this, on the other ,hand it helps children to develop creativeness  and they can express their feelings.",5,6.0
Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.,"People have different thoughts about the role and function of museums. I personally believe that museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.
On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a hall is to entertain. The gallery is known as a tourist attraction where exhibits a collection of interesting objects that people want to see. Almost people go to the gallery in their space time when no longer having pressure of work or studying. It leads to the fact that they seem to avoid intake too much education and academic content. It is understandable that museums often emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning.By having interactive activities or games which is quite visually spectacular.
On the other hand, educational function could be seen in the role of museums where shows documentary or objects related to history and culture. Through visiting, tourists tend to discover something new about the history behind the gallery 's exhibits. That is the reason why professional guides are employed and heat sets are offered to support visitors to easily access to detailed knowledge about history, culture, science and other aspects of life.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a good hall should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.",3,5.0
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession.   What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion,   should be done about it?","When young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they   will find a great job upon graduation. In reality many fresh graduates fail to find work in their field   and some are even forced to take up a below graduate level job. In my opinion, the root of this   problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernized.   Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of   reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly   educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of   IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is   that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business and law, and do not   recruit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour   market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers.   A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint   efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closer with employers, they   could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could   develop guidelines on how many students universities should recruit in each subject in   accordance with the market demand.   In conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field is because university education might not have provided them with the right skill set or an in-demand   profession. I think that universities and the government could improve the situation by updating   the content of the programmes and limiting the number of students in each subject in line with   the market demand.",4,5.5
Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discussed the views and give your opinion.,"There has long been controversy about environmental issues and people have a multitude of views about whether we should take measures to ameliorate the condition of the Earth or it is too late to take action at this stage. In my opinion, having a myriad of extinct animals and plants as yet, I believe conserving the environment is of paramount importance, not only to human, but also to any species on Earth.

On the one hand, some people think that the animals and plants which go to extinction, cannot be returned and, therefore, any suggested solutions are still useless. Most of the people only concern about themselves, they do not pay attention to any species as long as beef, pork and chicken that they usually consume are still available for them.

On the other hand, others think that it is never too late to start protecting the environment by taking effective measures. It is known that animals are our friends and human is a part of animals undoubtedly. As a result, if animals are experiencing extinction, so as human do in the coming future. In other words, saving the Earth tantamount to saving ourselves.

In my opinion, having living with animals and plants on the same planet, we have responsibility to keep this place in a satisfactory state of living which is clean. On an individual level, we can do some simple but helpful things, for instance, taking our own rubbish when we go hiking or beach, turn off air-conditioner when no one is using etc. More vitally, educators should start building up students' mind at young age to allow them to understand the situation of environment and ways to preserve it.

Under this line of thinking, despite the fact that we cannot bring extinct animals back, the situation that the environment is having now can not be ignored and people should take measures in daily life in order to bring positive effect on plant and animal species.",3,5.0
People nowadays tend to have children at an later/older ages. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"There is an increasing number of older people who want to have a baby in their later life. In this essay, some positive and negative views on that issue before conveying an opinion on that. 

There are some good points for that statement. First of all, the time when they have their babies will be mature enough for them to nurture their juniors to become outstanding stars in the future. Another thing is that their financial status is stable when they have a well-paid job and monthly income for their daily expenses. Otherwise, they have to worry about their expenditures if they have children when they are very young. So, it will be good timing for older couples to have babies in their older ages as they have a financially stable condition to support and nurture their offspring. 

However, there will be more risks if they plan to have a baby only when they have a stable income. For example, there might be higher chances of getting an abnormal child for older parents from the medical aspect.  Eventually, it will impact the family when they have a problematic child. In addition, the generation gap between juniors and parents will be a huge barrier for both of them. Finally, no matter what the parents try to understand their juniors, there could be some misunderstandings between them, resulting in making them troublesome ones. 

In conclusion, although there are many pros and cons to this view, I am opinion that the negative factors outweigh the positive ones in terms of having abnormal new-comers, misunderstanding between them and creating them as troublesome folks for society.",8,7.5
"Write about the following topic.Psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?","The colours and its affect on humans feelings always interested the psychologists and become a part of their researches. This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.
It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.
Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place. To give an example, the infinity effect of white colour is always used by hospitals. They paint their desks, tables, rooms, bathrooms or walls to white colour most of the time. This way, they calm their patients and help them to relieve their stress. Another example is grey. It is one of the favourite colour of the companies. They use this colour mainly in their office to make sure their employees are not distracted so they can finish their task.

"Write about the following topic.

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Art has become increasingly popular nowadays. That's why, some people start to advocate that art lessons is crucial for children, while some are of the opinion that it causes them to spend their time inconveniently. I reckon that art is an indispensable part of heirs is because it improves kids' creativity and enables them to use this skill as a job opportunity.

 First and foremost, the majority of people are thinking that only science or math courses are important and art, music or sport activities should not be covered in classes since it doesn't make any contribution to children. Quite the contrary, researches have pointed out such activities, namely painting or charcoal provide lots of benefit for children. It influences their cognitive behaviours, let them improve their hand talent and enable them to gain different perspectives. Artists' imaginations and sights are different from us. They can easily create something new, distinguish the differences between colours and they can reflect their thoughts by not talking. Such behaviours like that can not be learned by solving math problems. 

 On the other hand, due to the these courses offsprings have an opportunity to see that  job options are not only posed by doctors, engineers or lawyers. If kids have an interest in art they should be encouraged to see that this is not merely a hobby they can do this for the rest of their time. Unfortunately, parents are disagree with the argument that art is not a job it is just an entertainment activity. Therefore, they discourage their offspring. For example, even though my cousin has a huge interest in art her parents didn't let her to enrol Art Faculty, but after she graduated from the university she applied to the faculty and she took an acceptance. 

  To sum up, people have different ideas about art. Some of them think that it should be teaching children at school whereas others are in the opponent idea. Yet, ı reckon that it helps younger students to gain new skills and change their views and it also enables kids to sustain these attitudes as a job when they grow up.",5,6.0

On the contrary, some people assume  that this approach has no considerable benefits on the human body. In my perspective, I believe it has huge significance in improving health which would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

On the one hand, recreational centres such as gyms, swimming pools are plays a vital role innimproving well being of human . Owing to that fact, it assist in building endurance , strength and power that will ultimately increase the fitness level of a person. In addition, these places are accessible to every person of the community. So , one can easily use according to their schdules .All these factors in combination promotes a stragety to build a healthy nation.

On the other hand, these days people are extremely busy in handling work load and completiting targets and meeting deadlines. So they hardly get somwtime for themselves to utilise the benefits of these places. In addition , there are many other sectors  of the society which  are needed to be improved to provide good health services to citizens such as hospitals.

In my opinion , it is not possible abd afforable for everyone to get all equipments for excercising at home as they are very expensive . Recreational centres offfers them at a reasonable prices and even free of cost. So it gives chance to improve health despite of their financial condition.

To conclude, although a number of other sectors also require good funding but there are lot of incredible benefits of general games centres on health which should not be ignored.",3,5.0

Many believe that art is crucial subject for little ones, while other argue that it is a wastage of time. The following essay will explore the topic from both perspective and justify reasons and appropriate epitome.

To commence with, it is undeniable that art is a medium that connects people with the culture and society which lead them to know clearly about the context of historians as well as culture. As a result, this instills a sense of pride and confidence in them. For instance, in India, art is mandatory to teach from the primary classes. Moreover, it improves the perception and problem solving skills due to this youngsters learn to think out of the box, to innovate. 

On the other hand, many people argue that instead of art, other subjects are more important such as english, science and mathematics because it gives better career opportunities. Besides, studying art does not lead to a successful career. It is easy to see that in these days, most of the artists have been struggling to make a living from selling their work of art. Therefore, these are some reasons why other things is essential.

In conclusion, it is true that without art children does not know about their old culture and also art improves their problem solving skills, however, i believe that in order to become successful in future, one must learn other subjects such as science and english due to better career opportunities.",4,5.5
"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle

materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught

this at home.

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","It is often argued that schools should own the responsibility to give awareness among youngsters about goods recycling and waste depletion whilst others disagree and thinks that homes are considered as a better learning place for kids for such education. While primary educational institutes are considered to be the initial learning place for growing minds, I believe that parents' and grandparents' contributions can not be neglected. In this essay, I will discuss in favour of school rather than the living place as a suitable land for children to understand the importance of recycling and discourage waste production with relevant examples.

 There is no doubt that kids always follow what they see in their daily routines. Kids spend 65% of their time in homes which gives them an opportunity to mingle with family members. As a result, their learning is based on observations. Parents and others should follow the practice of recycling disposals and garbage reduction. Such materials are but not limited to; Card boxes & Plastics. For example, a number of youtube channels are available that convey a plethora of ideas about recycling such as wastage and because of the hectic routine of the elder generation, kids are often provided with a variety of electronic devices that keep them engaged. As a consequence, they learn with fun at home with their best interest.

On the hand, Schools are another professional hub for the young generation equipped with modernized facilities that make learning more interesting. I believe that courses can be designed to make recycling and waste prevention a compulsory subject. Setup the special labs that illustrate the types of reusable materials, the process of recycling, and the reduction in litter production could develop a sense of maturity among children at an early age. For instance, The Kenedy School in Brisbane is well known for its achievement in making the world's first prototype of the recycling process together with waste depletion techniques. However, it comes at a massive cost. 

 

To recapitulate, it is vital for children to learn about reusable products and the reduction in the generation of disposals. However, the part played by early educational institutes in this regard outweighs the knowledge transferred by inhabitants as school facilities significantly impact their learning process.",7,7.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Nowadays, thanks to the development of the economy and technology, consumer goods are massively manufactured. However, the synthesis of these products can bring negative impacts to the environment. The causes of this problem and corresponding solutions will be discussed below.

One of the reasons for this issue is that people desire more and more merchandise, but green technology is not advanced enough. During recent decades, the wealth of people is significantly increasing, so people have more needs and wants in various products, such as computers and telephones. As a result, the supply must also soar to match the requests from the society. Meanwhile, there are still insufficient resources that can drastically reduce the pollution of the surroundings during manufacturing processes. For example, a great deal of sulfur dioxide will certainly be formed when a factory produces toys. Moreover, some non-degradable chemicals such as plastics can pose a threat to the Earth, because the combustion of these substances can create an enormous amount of hazardous gas. Eventually, the contamination and damage to the air and the land will be much more severe unless the production and consumption pattern changes.

Based on that, a feasible solution to this problem is that we should develop environmentally friendly technology. As we know, it is highly unlikely to alter people's consumption patterns. Hence, we need to figure out some ways that can alleviate the damage to the environment. For instance, the use of hydropower for providing electricity to plants can lessen the demand for combusting fuels. Additionally, companies can start to apply degradable materials for disposable products. If straws are made of materials that can be degraded, they are not required to be burned in the landfill.

In conclusion, the underdeveloped green technology and the surge in demand for goods are the main reasons for environmental pollution. To tackle this problem, we need to invent technology that can benefit the environment.",7,7.0
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time . This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well .

A handful of people consider that volunteer works by the teens for the community during free time is ideal and, I am completely agree with this fact and will discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.

The unpaid community deeds help youngsters to utilize their time in a productive manner which would lead them to get life time skills. For instance, if a youngster will have some work which is totally his/her responsibility and they need to finish within a specified timeline, these will help them to learn time management and the task done for the community will be done by not spending extra expenses to a paid worker and help community to save the money. Hence, these works help teens to get away from the bad doings and community get a good citizen.

Furthermore, the experiences and references can also bring positive repercussions. To illustrate, these communities always have the connections with the people who work for the higher reputed companies, which can help teenagers by giving references and can help to find a prestige job. Moreover, these volunteer works give the experience to the youngsters which can benefit them, in case , they start to work in similar work replated organisation.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","The pattern of the house or building agriculture can explain the history of the specific areas significantly. Therefore, nowadays, nations increasingly tend to start studying from these accommodations  which refer to the past of the region . In this essay, I will elucidate the reason for this direction and the way to research  this, and the following examples will be provided to support my point of view.

To begin with, the most important reason is that learning architecture would lead to knowing  the history of that region in each era, whether about a political issue, economic, religion, the way of people's lives or even the important natural events which impacted to the living of people which would be the fundamental knowledge to prevent to make a mistake which was the same in the past. For example, according to the latest survey conducted by Bangkok University, it has been revealed that 80% of architecture in the ancient cities such as Ayutthaya province, Sukhothai province have expressed their social identity in each era. Learning from the mistakes or successes of people in the past from building would flourish modern society, so there are more and more people interested in this.

Another important thing is how to research the past which had happened in the past and also some evidence which could prove the truth might disappear or misrepresent. I think apart from studying in the historical class, another option to find out the truth is that experience in that field. This would be closer to the traditional nation who might have experienced it by their own or their family's members, and we would see the culture, beliefs and geography which would express the truth.

In conclusion, I think the reason why more and more people are becoming too interested in architecture in their living area is that they need to know the past to prevent to make a mistake and develop their cities , however, there are many methods to research this such as learning from academic institutes or even experiencing by their own.",8,7.5
"Some people think that in order to continue improving the quality of high school education, students should be encouraged to evaluate and criticize their teachers. Others, however, believe that this would result in the loss of discipline for teachers. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","These days, public debate has been going on over whether students should give their opinions or not about their teachers.  I tend to believe that feedbacks improve significantly the educational level for the following reasons.

Three main factors support the idea of encourage pupils to analize they tutors. The primary factor we need to take into consideration is that the methodogy used sometimes is innapropriate for a group. However, if the points to improve or mantain are suggested, the educational process flows better. Besides, the teacher is a professional who depends of a good relationship with the class to make his job run properly. That is to say, if both sides are not at the same page, the learning achievement can be harmed. A third reason for my belief is that, even a person who has a previous experience teaching needs a feedback to set up his future goals in order do keep growing. By this I mean, each professional depends of their client's return to plan his next step on career.

I admit that students sometimes confuse the idea of take their opinions considerated with a reduction of the respect to authority requested to them. Despite that, a deep explanation about the target expected to be achieve on this new approach can leads to a sucess.

In conclusion, I would argue that students considerations should be given to their teachers. Accordingly, it would be generally advisable for the school stimulate this practise in a beneficial away.",1,4.0
The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Education is a vital task for every student. Teachers teaching students in the classroom is the normal education procedure in every country, but according to some, it is true that typical teaching situations will change in 2050, as the education sector is at a developing pace around the globe. I completely agree with the aforementioned viewpoint and the following essay will elaborate on my answer further in detail. 

To commence with, the normal system of teaching students in classrooms will change to online teaching methods. Where both educators and learners can attend the class through a certain website and it is convenient for both parties. Additionally, in the past students and teachers used to refer to numerous resources with the help of books as well as children studied hours scrolling pages of books to find information regarding their learning, but with the development in online teaching and learning methods learning as well as finding data will be effective and efficient. As an example, the schools are already following the online teaching methodology. Typical classrooms in schools will be shut down as a result of new online classrooms. 

On the other hand, in the ,future there will be no longer teachers to teach the children. Every style of teaching and providing information will be done through the use of Artificial Intelligence. This method will be adequate for many children, where they have to use a few buttons to click and their voice to learn new things. According to research countries such as UK and US are already on the front line for testing AI teaching methods. However, children will adapt to artificial intelligence learning techniques in the near future. 

To conclude, I strongly agree the classic method of teaching in classrooms will change for online teaching and Artificial Intelligence teaching methods by 2050.",10,8.5
Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the population is increasing at a brisk pace. Most of the population is trying to live in urban areas thus, creating a housing shortage. This issue is causing a lot of social issues. Many people think that this can be resolved only with government intervention. I completely agree with this assumption and will support it with relevant reasons in this essay.

There are many problems that arise when there is a crisis in housing. One of the major problems is the rise in rent. For example, in cities like New York rents for a single room is somewhere around 1000 dollars. This is very high the government should introduce strict regulations that keep control.

Another problem is the rise in housing prices. People always try to buy a house for themselves. Due to the increase in demand for houses. Real estate companies inflate house prices. For example, in cities like Toronto a single studio costs between one and two million dollars. This indeed makes it impossible to buy in this economy.

Furthermore, this shortage will increase homelessness. If both the rent and house prices keep on climbing then, no one will be able to buy a place or pay a lease. This will bring citizens onto the streets. For Instance, a recent study indicates that there is already a thirty per cent rise in homeless people. The authorities should open more shelter homes to address this problem.

To conclude, the housing shortage is a very big social problem. Government should introduce various policies to keep both residence rates and leases in control. Additionally, they should build more shelter homes and upgrade the existing ones to keep homelessness in control.",4,5.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Climate change is the greatest threat to the existence of life on earth. Some people, however, argue that instead of preventing it we should find a way to live with it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce our impact on the climate of earth.

Global warming is the main cause of climate change. If both the people and the governments take appropriate actions, this can be controlled to a great extent. For example, the governments should stop the generation of power from fossil fuels which cause more carbon emissions and increase global warming. Governments can also invest in green energy sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Another practical solution that the government can implement is to impose ‘green taxes’ on industries and vehicles which emit carbon. Individuals should also try to reduce their carbon footprint by limiting the use of private vehicles and consuming energy responsibly.

Trying to live with climate change instead of preventing it is a dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. When the sea levels rise coastal cities will get submerged in water. Let us not forget the fact that almost all major cities in the world are extremely close to seas and oceans. Climate change also leads to various natural calamities like cyclones, flooding and drought.

To conclude, when there are so many ways to prevent climate change, I cannot agree with the argument that we should find a way to live with it. Climate change is threatening our very existence on this planet and it is high time we did something to tackle this alarming issue",5,6.0
"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","An ideal society where people co-exist in perfect harmony and respect, regardless of race, beliefs, or gender, is a universally desired idea. Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because it’s unrealistic.
Striving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.
While it’s beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldn’t I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress can’t be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.
In conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality. Schools, governments, and communities should nevertheless encourage people to actively think and work on becoming better versions of themselves.",10,8.5
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","It goes without saying that in recent years there has been a proliferation of voluntary organizations which are set out to prompt individuals’ contributions to the society. With regard to this trend, an array of people propose that schools should integrate voluntary work into the graduation requirements. From my viewpoint,unpaid services are definitely in students’ interest, however, students should be encouraged instead of being compelled. 
To commence with, it is indubitable that volunteerism  helps students bolster their social skills and widen the scope of their knowledge, which will stand them in good stead when applying for a permanent job. Undertaking a period of unpaid work is a golden chance for students to collaborate with an assortment of people from all social backgrounds, together with whom they can share their experiences and understandings. For example, my aunt, who is a qualified nurse, attributes  her success to the valuable experiences that she gained when working in the local hospital in the role of a candy striper. In her words, without those years of volunteering, her achievements would be far from what she accomplishes today.
Moreover, it is worth bearing in mind that through volunteer service, students will be better cognizant of the meaningfulness of life and therefore, be more grateful for what they have. As a matter of fact, children nowadays tend to have whatever they want at their fingertips, which renders their demands even more unreasonable. A voluntary trip to the poverty-stricken areas, which give them a chance to meet destitute children, will make them realize that what they take for granted is what other people yearn for.  For instance, one of my cousins, Linh, used to be an exigent child due to the indulging way of upbringing her parents use. However, once time she took part in a voluntary organization aiming at underprivileged children  . After the time there, it dawned on her that she was blessed with nutritional meals and expensive clothes while many other children weren’t and since then, she has appreciated her life more. 
Despite the aforementioned benefits, mandatory services may also be counterproductive in the absence of students’ willingness. Out of disinclination, they may try to shirk their duties or do them unenthusiastically.  Therefore, rather than compel students to join voluntary organizations, schools should induce them by showing the significance of their commitment to the local community. And if possible, students should be spoilt for choice so that they can choose the activities that are congruous with their abilities and hobbies. 
In conclusion, voluntary work is indeed advantageous to both students themselves and the society. However, to obtain the optimal results, students’ willingness should be guaranteed.",4,5.5

Overall, consumption of both the Margarine and Butter spreads reduced over time while Low fat and reduced spread increased. The Butter spread was the most favoured spread in 1981 and the consumption of it increased until 1986 from 140 grams to 160 grams. Then, it decreased gradually from 160 grams to about 50 gram from 1986 to 2007. On the other hand, consumption of the Margarine spread decreases from 90 grams to 80 grams from 1981 to 1986.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In recent years, the situation of environmental pollution has been increasing, which mainly caused by industrial plants springing up all over the world. This essay will discuss one of the environmental pollution issues associated with the production and suggest viable solutions, before coming to a reasoned conclusion. 
As life develops every day, due to the living standards of people raises, the demand for goods also requires more. The number of goods is mainly produced by machines, and output a much larger volume than 30 years ago. Consequently, waste from manufactories releases CO2 emission which causes environmental pollution and as a result leads to climate change and catastrophic natural disasters. For instance: Today, In the developing countries, because the need for transportation is high and owning vehicles such as motorbikes and cars too easy, level pollution of those countries is always in alarm condition. In addition, the damaging of the environment not only from the companies, but also from unconscious individuals.
Although high consumption of goods will help the economy to develop, environmental issues need to be addressed. First, regulations and rankings are needed to assess each company's infection level of emission and take sanctions for companies that affect the environment. Encourage the businesses to apply advanced technologies to reduce pollution levels and use clean energy such as solar energy, wind energy. For example: countries in Europe, if the automobiles want to operate on the road, they must fully meet the regulations on emission for vehicles. Thus, there are many workarounds, but applying them to all places in the world that are not easy and require a lot of time to implement.
In conclusion, besides economic development, environmental protection should also be more attentive. Because this is the planet where we live and our descendants will grow.",9,8.0
Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There have been significant developments in relation to communication in recent years, however it is often argued that this technological progress had had a detrimental effect on many people’s relationships. Although in numerous cases damage is being done to social interactions, I also strongly maintain that there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication.
Corresponding online can clearly be a hindrance in many situations. The principal drawback is that social websites such as Facebook can be very addictive, therefore people spend less time communicating face to face. It is commonplace to see group of friends or family members who are gathered together in a social situation, however their main focus is frequently their smartphones. Secondly, the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging. Due to the fact that posts and group messages are often sent without the recipient knowing the sender personally, users are frequently more thoughtless, or even abusive, compared to what they can be held accountable for their words.
Despite the aforementioned harmful aspects, the latest communication devices are also advantageous in a variety of respects. Firstly, prior to the introduction of the internet, there were limited opportunities to keep in contact with others. Many examples have been seen of childhood friends who lost contact as a result of moving to a new town or attending a diffrerent university. With the introduction of social networking, this situation is now easily avoidable. In addition, social media also provides opportunities to build new relationships with likeminded people. By taking advantage of social groups and mutual friend recommendations, connections can now be built anywhere across the world. Looking back 20 years, it was uncommon for friends to be made outside of a local community.
To conclude, there is no doubt that communication methods have been revolutionised over the last two decades. Whether this progression benefits or harms people socially, however, depending largely on individual circumstances. To avoid the potential issues presented above, it is vital that sufficient time is also devoted to more traditional forms of socialising.",6,6.5

People think that the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"It is believed that the best solution to environmental problems would be for government to increase the cost of fuel. This notion is fundamentally justified, yet other measures might have an even greater impact.
 On the one hand, there are two primary reason why raising the petrol prices is the critical way to solve environmental issues. First, motorists would limit the number and length of their journeys by private cars to compensate for the extra expense. Government should then be forced to upgrade and expand public transport, as people still have to work, travel to meet their daily needs, for example. Second, if the price of petrol increase, more freights and goods are more likely to be transported by rail than trucks. This will lower emissions from vehicles, as such reducing the greenhouse effect.
On the other hand, the importance of other measures must not be underestimated. The logic behind this is that the onus falls on government to impose restrictions on the advertising motorized transport and require media outlets to promote the positive image of cycling, one of the most environmentally-friendly vehicles. Once the stigmas around bicycling are removed and the general public are better-informed of its environmental benefits, more bikes are expected to be seen on the road. Furthermore, the local authorities in London, for example, introduced the congestion charge on all vehicles visiting in the city center. They use the money raised to subsidize the cost of fares and to invest in transport infrastructure that will improve the air quality, resulting in the reduction of exhaust fumes.
In conclusion, although raising the price of petrol is a plausible environment-related transport measure, other steps would be more effective in the long term. Government should strike a balance between these approaches in an effort to go green.",5,6.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. what are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","It is gaining popularity amongst people to be historically inclined towards the background of their residential houses and buildings. The essay will attempt to discuss the reasons behind this eagerness and provide ways in which people may be able to collect information regarding it.

To begin with, apart from the curiosity that usually tempts people to strive to find out more about their residential houses, rehabilitation is another reason why, people perpetually look for information because unfortunately, many older homes have been stripped of their original charm and renovated to the “style of the moment” by previous owners thus, for those owners who would like the rustic charm back into their homes and appreciate the original oldish figure better than the modernized one, it is crucial to educate themselves about the backstory of their houses therefore, by gaining an insight into a home’s architectural timeline, homeowners have the ability to bring back some of the original integrity and style. Or, if by any chance, the charm is still present, be cognizant that it remains. Furthermore, being aware of the conditions of the house helps people save money. by way o example, considering refinements for certain parts of the house that may have been vulnerable, people can prevent any demolishment and as a result, mitigate the risk of having to spend a fortune over reconstructing the building.

Having said that, people are acutely looking for reliable resources to establish cognition about their residential apartment nevertheless, considering the few available sources from which the information can be accumulated, the local library is the best option since it collects ancient books and old photographs which may be helpful in discovering historical facts. Moreover, asking the previous owner, the realtor or historical societies in addition to subscribing to genealogy websites may assist individuals in gathering information.

In conclusion, even though it takes real effort and passion to collect accurate information about where you live, doing so will help us acquire insight into useful details of the building to either entertain or educate ourselves and enables further consideration towards the essence and context of the house.",7,7.0
"Some people think in order to continually improve the quality of education, high school students should be encouraged to evaluate and criticize their teachers. Others feel that this would result in a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion","Nobody would dispute the fact that the responsibilities and duties of a teacher is extremely important and impactful to students. I hold the view that school pupils should be encouraged to evaluate and criticise their tutors periodically, however, many people disagree with this opinion.  In this essay, I will discuss both sides and give reasons for my opinions. 

Firstly, it is probably true to say that teachers in school as a human being are needed to treat with respects, however, teaching ways may be varied from one to another tutors, and the only way to improve in effectiveness and efficiency in teaching are to get feedback from students. For instance, when students are confused what teacher had taught in class they will tend to wander their mind and lose concentration in class, and they are more likely to fail their exam in the future. Hence, teachers should always asking for reviews and suggestions from their suggestion for better improvement. 

However, there are those who argue that teacher would result in a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom if they were to collect reviews from their students. For example, nobody would contest the fact that teachers could not take down their egos in accepting the criticism from pupils. In addition, it is often claimed that teachers are always right and have their ways of teaching the syllabus, as because of they are experienced aduts compared to youth. For instance, students often get restrictions to comment about teachers in school, and many parents are on the side of teachers. 

To conclude, although there are some reasonable arguments against feedback with regards the way that teacher teach in class, there can be no doubt that the potential advantages of getting feedback from students far outweigh the disadvantages of having one-sided learning. Therefore, head of principals should collect more feedback and suggestion from their students. It can be done anonymously to prevent bias to behappened.",4,5.5

This encourages socially-cultural awareness, helping countries extend their own influence on culture as architecture.

By increasing  cultural awareness, some people are made to acquire knowledge about the sense of house- or building-related history. They represent major engineering challenges which were faced during construction in their country.

Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the contemporary era, a noticeable shift in family planning has emerged and a growing number of individuals have a tendency is have their offspring at a later stage. I believe there are numerous benefits such as they can spend quality time together and preparing mentally, a financially better for their children.

       First and foremost, one of the pivotal reasons why individuals delay parenthood is the aspiration of young couples to spend quality time together before they must devote all of their attention to the baby. Subsequently, they can enjoy their life more with one another and can be able to understand each other. In addition, they can prepare carefully mentally before entering a new position and learn more knowledge before becoming parents. Therefore, young parents no longer be sluggish in looking after their children and taking care of them in the best way. For instance, some Western researchers said that having more understanding before childbirth can lead to lower chances of divorce after having babies and can take good care of them. 

         On the other hand, a number of individuals who concentrate on their careers first and then have babies can bring their kids a better quality of life such as a better education, an excellent study environment and even a luxurious life. Moreover, having offspring early can cause young inexperienced parents to get into trouble and cause financial difficulties for them. For illustration, several young Vietnamese parents would be capable of enrolling their children in private schools where they get quality education and learn other skills meanwhile, which are not available in all schools because they have prepared for parenthood for a long time before having children. 

        In conclusion, the tendency to have children at later ages is caused by a number of factors, such as the quality of time they spend with each other and preparing financial security for parenthood. All things considered, it is my strong belief that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.",7,7.0
Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"In today's globalised world, the introduction of smart devices and the Internet have definitely changed the way mankind communicates. It is argued that negative consequences due to the modern communication technology can be shown in relationships of any kind. Although, some people may have difficulty to engage in person with others, the advanced devices allow human-being to mantain relationship around the world and improve their contact network.
People who believe that the introduction of new technology has negative effect on how we related to other could have a point. More human-beings are comfortable with new technologies due to the elimination of anxiety or stressful feelings triggered by face-to-face meetings. Moreover, modern devices allow erasing unprofessional or informal messages with a simple click of a button. Despite the fact that people might lose the ability to communicate correctly at the first attempt, these recent technologies offer more opportunity, encouraging shy and not confident personality.

How can people research this?","There is an increasing number of people who are interested in finding out the history of their living place. They want to know because they are curious and keen on having a sense of connection to the community. They are able to reach this information by interviewing residents who lived there for a long time.

Curiosity makes people eager to understand the hidden history in terms of the building structure, style, and materials. These make people appreciate the beauty of their living place that is not noticed easily. For instance, several buildings in HK have used the building style from the UK. This makes the building very unique, and people found out the history is related to the UK colonising HK in the past. Every building has a special design, which provides architectural knowledge to people. 

Developing a sense of connection is another reason that they want to find out the history. Since the convenience of technology, neighbours might be unfamiliar with each other as they do not talk in person usually. Having a connection can provide a way to unite with neighbours and enhance the relationship within the community to remember the history of the tower. 

Interviewing old people in the building is one way to get known to the history in depth. They usually live in the building for a very long time, meaning they experienced many things and witness the changes in the living environment.

Some people think governments should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environmental problems. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental problems, for instance, water, air and sound pollution are giving government great pressure as it deteriorates the people’s health and decrease the country’s reputation in the world. It is considered by some that governments should raise the price of fuel for transport to eliminate the environmental problems. In my opinion, I disagree that rise in cost of fuel is an effective solution. However, I believe that there are other better and long term solution such as using renewable energy and improving public transportation.

     Raising the fuel price will only be a short term solution because people will continue the use of transportation as there are no other viable options to run the vehicles. In fact, people will eventually accept the high fuel price for their own convenience to travel everywhere they wish with their own car. Besides, due to increase in petrol price, the transportation costs increase causing price of goods to rise, creating a detrimental domino effect in economy and increase the people’s burden. For example, shipping fee for online shopping which is free before, now is charged due to higher transportation cost.

     On the other hand, I believe that a more effective long term solution is using the more sustainable energy such as solar energy, hydropower and wind energy to run both private and public transport which emission of harmful gases, for example, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide which contributes to deteriorating of air pollution. Furthermore, vehicles using renewable energy often engines produce lesser noise which can enhance the sound pollution. Government should take actions in improving public transport to engage people to use as well as older transports usually are not eco-friendly.

"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY ALL JOBS WILL BE DONE BY ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ROBOTS.
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION","Science and technology have aided humans with a plethora of facilities and looking at its progression one can presume that, future jobs done by hi tech robots is no wonder. Nevertheless i rebut this presumption, as it will cause unemployment and not all jobs are dependable on machines. Which we will discuss here

First of all,  humans are the fundamental source of any any development, and it is exigent for a person to nurture his livelihood.  For instance, we can say that artificial intelligent robot are devised at a high end laboratory, which is indeed built by humans and furthermore robots are programmed with specific data's, whereas humans can react with changing  parameters. Second of all, it is not a feasible task, as we all know that by mere improvement I technology and ease of work with advanced machine have cut numerous jobs for the labour class populace. It can affect same to the middle and upper workforce of any organization. 

In my opinion, I think  such immense discovery must be utilized in the highly critical area, such as chemical factories and biomedical waste management are best examples also there are many more,  where humans are at risk to perform a task. Today, considerable of people will face health issues who work in such hazardous area, so if artificial intelligence is employed in these areas, it can succumb desired outcomes. But if it is used in every sector than, unemployment and chaos could be the ultimatum. 

In conclusion, after the perusal of above thesis it drew to me to the fact that inspite of having tremendous functionality with technology, it is evident that, intelligence should be applied wisely and not unnecessarily which can deteriorate employment.",9,8.0
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

","In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influence work productivity. Some argue that uniform is not less important for employees because of the quality of their work is the main matters. To a certain extent, I agree with this opinion, however, I also think that base on the work’s properties, the staff should choose an outfit suitable for this job.
On the one hand, there is a good reason why a number of individuals think that wear is unnecessary. First of all, there are jobs that do not require dressing up because it does not yield any positive effect on work. Some technology companies like Google or Facebook are famous for their relaxed dress code. They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment. Some jobs such as website designers, programmer, that always just sit at their working desk and look to the laptop screen and file paper all their working time, so they usually do not care about the dress that they wear. Secondly, these occupations do not involve meeting customer or partner, therefore, it should be made free for employees as what to wear a comfortable dress to work. 
On the other hand, numerous people hold the notion that staff should take dressing style into full consideration. These may work in the sectors that require workers to dress up smartly and professional upfront workers like receptionist, teacher, doctor, etc who meet others face-to-face wherein one’s attire may leave either good or bad impressions. In these situations, even though how you present yourself with your fashion preference may not directly affect how you carry out your responsibilities, it could affect social interaction which are important in such jobs.
In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work.

I definetely agree with former idea due to the fact that I belive that there are no differences between arts and other sevices like schools and hospitals.

To begin with, art one of the most essential ways to be get close the society and to boost the cultural level of the community. For example, establishing vary of art museums, cinemas and concert buildings  enables to create common values for citizens. İf these places had not opened, people would not reach the opportunitiy which can strength invisible emotional communication among the society. In other words, spending money to art sector not only does has effects on community in visible way, but also it might contribute to progress relationships between the citizens.

On the other hand, no one can deny that public services such as medical services and colleges which provide to live better condition for poeple, one of the most crucial tools to take after its own citizens for rulers. To illusrate, progress of human history generally has been based on novelties which have involved overcoming health and education problems. In fact, the history has shown that the mankind could live more than it had lived thanks to capability of medical services and it have learned that to raech this proficiency have been needed the schools.  Yet, although schools and hospitals quite essential for society, it should be considered that art activities have huge importance in the same way.

"Some people say that to prevent illness and disease, government should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is commonly believed that the authorities should put more resources into reducing pollution and preventing illness from human lives. This essay will explain why I totally agree with this perspective

Admittedly, there is good reason to say that pollution is one of the circumstances of illness. To begin with, climate change makes people depleted and not have any energy. For instance, the temperature suddenly surges and declines in just one day. People need to go through four seasons in a day. They can not adapt to this kind of weather, therefore, more and more people get sick. Illness leaves them unable to work efficiently. This is the reason why the government should put more effort into reducing pollution to save residents from health problems.

In addition, there is also a compelling reason to argue that political leaders should focus on housing problems. Lack of housing is also the reason why people get a lot of diseases. A good example is homeless people. They do not have any places to go so they need to stay outside. It will be worse if the weather is cold. Moreover, sleeping outside unconsciously puts their health at risk. The authorities should provide common accommodation for homeless people. Therefore, we can reduce the number of people who get diseases or illness

In conclusion, I would argue that the government should have some method to reduce the number of people having illnesses and diseases. The authorities can deal with housing issues and pollution to prevent illness",9,8.0
"EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT, OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ROBOT WILL BE DOING MANY OF THE JOBS CURRENTLY DONE BY HUMANS. DISCUSS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS.","The use of robots not only in the technology industry but also in other industries like the medical and manufacturing fields has increased drastically in the past decade. For instance, nowadays there are robots who can perform surgery, manufacture automobiles and answer calls and respond to clients. So, in my opinion, robots will replace humans in the majority of the jobs presently done by them. This is because robots are more productive than workers as well as make fewer errors. In addition, robots cost lesser to maintain and can benefit an enterprise greatly. 

There are plenty of advantages to automating a job. Firstly, the mechanization of jobs can lead to higher productivity of a company. A study conducted by  Harvard University in 2020, stated that these appliances tended to perform their tasks 40% to 50% faster than people. It can be said that a machine makes fewer mistakes than a human. In short, the advent of machines in the industry can help increase productivity, allowing tasks to be completed faster with fewer errors. Secondly, robots cost much lesser to maintain than workers. A survey conducted by Alphabet incorporation has said that machines are worth six times lesser than humans.This is primarily due to the fact that a robot doesn't need a salary to perform. Hence, it can be said that robots will replace the jobs of one in the coming years. 

In contrast, the automation of a job has its drawbacks as well. The major drawback would be unemployment.In a survey conducted by the New York Times, it was said that automation of jobs would leave 60% to 70% of the population unemployed. Mainly it would affect the unskilled labour force, who rely on these professions to make a living. In summary, unemployment would be a major cause to stress  if the dawn of computerization arrives. Another disadvantage is the fact that equipment is very expensive to buy.Around 30% of companies have stated that while automation is a well worth investment, at the moment it is too expensive. The enterprise has to make sure that it can afford such machines and frequently upgrade them as well. In conclusion, robots tend to be expensive as a result substitution of human jobs does not seem possible. 

In a nutshell, robots can help an enterprise greatly as they offer greater efficiency and low cost of maintenance as compared to humans thus it is believed that robots will replace human jobs. However, to prevent loss of the jobs of individuals, a company must not focus on replacing human professions rather they must focus on integrating both resources to produce maximum benefit.",10,8.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university. 
The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career. 
On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete. 
For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level. ",7,7.0
"The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Although the health related issues caused by smoking are well known to society, smoking is still a popular habit amongst people. This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.
One of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked “cool” and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.
Even though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.
In conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes.",7,7.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Nowadays protection of the world environment is becoming a priority for  several concerned people. The extent of consuming products is increasing day by day which poses a great threat to this modern world, in terms of  land and air pollution. This essay will discuss two main reasons including an increased quantity of wastage and scarcity of organic resources and some solutions to address this overarching issue.

Several reasons can be considered responsible for polluting the current ecosystem. Firstly, the waste of products has increased at an exponential rate because of the industrial revolution that the world has observed in recent years. Selling a huge amount of one-time-use bottles by beverage companies is the best illustration of this thing. These canes are a big part of the problem of landfill. In addition, factories are using more and more natural resources. This not only results in depletion of organic fuel but also carbon particles are rising tremendously. It is, therefore, two main factors which are contributing to destroying numerous habitats.

However, despite these issues being significant, a variety of measures can be taken to mitigate these obvious problems. To begin with, recycling is one of the best ways to tackle this issue. For example, plastic bottles, and aluminium canes can be used again for repackaging. This activity could reduce the problem of the waste quantity of useless things. Another way is that a handsome amount of profit made by industries could be consumed to save the environment. This can be achieved by building recycling plants along with the introduction of green belts around factories to trap carbon particles from polluted air, released by industries. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the negative consequences of consumerism.

In conclusion, this essay discussed two major factors that could play a crucial role in increasing trash and how this phenomenon can be dealt with by introducing the culture of recycling and using money from the industrial sector to build green sections around them to purify the air.",10,8.5
The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is expected that future scholar generations will be exposed to a more diverse method of teaching than the current one, such as face-to-face lessons. I, personally, believe that a shift in the educational system is inevitable due to the rampant progress that technology is registering.

Nowadays, it is already noticeable a change in teaching techniques between parents and children generations. For instance, the oldest group had to bring daily physical books to follow lessons, youngsters can easily attend class with their laptop or have an interactive day, like videos and searching online information and so on. Furthermore, the disparity became more evident after the COVID-19 pandemic. When people were forced to isolate and maintain physical distance, government tried to push citizens to carry a normal life, starting by requesting schools to hold their class online. Although they had to face many difficulties in order to make a sudden vast adjustment, the results were comforting and hopeful. 

Another justification on why I agree that in the future class will not be in person anymore is that every person has access to an internet broadlabel, thus lectures can be online. Multiple reasons attest that this method is more effective and efficient. Firstly, it cuts the cost of commuting to and from school, helping families with their own financial budget, and diminish the risks of accidents during travel time. Moreover, the advanced way of lecturing will promote a responsible and independent behaviour. Not only will pupils learn the importance of these two characteristics, but they will approach a similar work condition, where they will be promoted if they are able to work or study unsupervised. 

To conclude, from my point of view, many situations will change in the following 30 years, but these will be extremely evident in the education system, where new technologies will be adopted to implement students' conditions and final learning results. These advancements will be beneficial both economically and to improve scholars' knowledge.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In our rather futuristic society for a number of ,reasons folk are getting more interested in the past of their hometowns. With the help of rapidly ameliorating ,technology their desire to learn about  history can be easily put into the activity. But what are the roots of such an eagerness?

First of all, the hectic lifestyle that we all experience nowadays does not leave any space for calmness and peace in our souls, so most of the population - especially adolescents - are struggling with finding their feet, whilst having a broad spectrum of knowledge about the world around really gives a feeling of confidence in the impermanence of activity. In addition to this, it is said that being aware of the past  can change the future. Consequently, if society wants to live a better activity in a more comfortable environment, they have to explore the history of their homes in order not to repeat past mistakes.

For this ,aims we are lucky to have multiple tools to carry out research into the subject. Despite libraries being considered as an old-fashioned and not necessarily convenient approach to learning, there are actually quite a few books and magazines which are not available online but which are extremely helpful when it comes to  local interests. News, photos, articles and interviews with different public published in old magazines indeed provide  a clear image of past events. Browsing the internet forums is also a great idea to find a piece of new information and make friends with mutual objectives.

Putting everything into a nutshell, learning about the history of your place not only builds a sense of confidence but also might have a big impact on our future way of life.",9,8.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single sex or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, choosing the right school for children is gaining popularity in ambiguous parts of the society. With the autonomy of choosing mixed-gender or single-gender classrooms, the parents are debating their choices. However, some feel that the children attending single-sexed schools may suffer in the future years of their life. In this essay, I will explain how single-sex institutions can affect the after journey of students.

To begin with, this can drastically change their confidence level to communication. Although, the pupil in the learning institutions are taught how to talk with manners but socialising with someone of the opposite sex can bring a little hesitation leading to not been able to present their ideas well. For instance, a girl studying in ""only girls"" college may find it hard to make guy friends 

. Therefore, children from thay schooling might not be very comfortable to socialise in the unisex environment.

Secondly, this might affect some individuals thinking process. Most people from the single-sex schools might find it hard to form a relationship with other genders as they might consider it a wrong thing. For example, in countries like India, especially during the old times, girls who had friends from opposite genders were judged as a bad person. Hence, in the same gender schools the thinking process continues to be like the old times.

To wrap up, I strongly agree education can work wonders to groom a human being boy having the right atmosphere and multi-gender environment around can prepare the individual in every situation. Therefore, co-educational learning system should be considered by adults while preparing the child's future.",3,5.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The great majority of people are always faced the dilemma of whether get a higher education or trying to get a job. I would say that deciding what is better for prosperous career depends on our own profession

    On the one hand, students can attain better results after practising during their university time. For instance, it is impossible to become a doctor without education or to be a pilot without knowledge as well. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that people with degree will succed later due to their specialization. As a result many doctors, engeneers, lawyers have enormous salary, though it is not everythere. If we compare countries like USA and Kazakhstan, we will see tremendous difference beetween wages

     On other hand, reason to start working after school is also tempting. In order to make many young generation starts to work immediately. It seems that because of  their rebellious nature they just want to be independent, but that's not always the case. A lot of us just don't see the point of four or more years of learning as well as passing exams and paper work. Music, IT, art and other occupations do not need educational background. To illustrate the point of this idea we need to recall the many examples of stars, inventors and other succesful people in our world. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg are good examples of such humans. Nevertheless, turning to their profession, it is obvious that without knowledge in their field, they will not achieve so unbelievable goals

    In conclusion, despite society has different views, I suppose that it would be better for all of us to choose our path independantly. You can work after school, if you have an ability and desire for it or you can improve your skills and try to do it later on.",1,4.0
Many people use social media to keep in touch with other people and for news events. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, latest information is conducted on social medias such as Facebook with their rapid developments. Instead of traditional methods, people prefer to use them as the way to obtain new information. From my perspective, in general, more advantages occur. 

There is a doubtless limitation for public to read news by social medias - possibility of having fake reports is relatively high because publishers are not all qualified; simultaneously, there is no supervision from the authority. Hence, if there was a fake report released, negative influence might exist. For instance, entertainment section on social medias always publishes articles about a celebrity's actions which are made up. Not only do they harm celebrities' reputation, but also occupy excess social resources. 

However, positive effects are various. For individuals, it is a more effective way to contact with the external world. For example, on WeChat, all public masses have their official accounts where they establish an omni-channel to provide people with services. Therefore, consumers only need to scroll their screens whenever they have leisure time and wherever they are. 

Moreover, from government, it is also a representation of enhancing democracy of the nation. Based on John Mill's political philosophy theory, a democratic polity should not prohibit citizens from the freedom of speech. What the social medias are capable of is allowing people to express their own ideas. Thus, for the government, it is beneficial to allow various information on the social medias. 

In conclusion, although there is a probobility of the existance of fake news, people can still aquire more information in an effective way, while it is also a symbol of democracy of a government. Therefore, advantages outweigh disadvantages.",3,5.0
"Some people think that robots are very important for human future development. Others, however, think that robots are dangerous inventions that could have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Ever since their inception, robots have been a polarizing topic. While the proponents of this technology are adamant that it will prove instrumental to our lives in the future, others say that robots will have adverse implications for human society. In this answer, I will look at the reasoning of both camps before explaining why I side with the former.

As the applications of robotics engineering pervade every aspect of life, it is hard to imagine mankind moving forward without it. For one, robots are key to driving economic productivity. Automated machines and processes have dispensed with inconsistent and exhaustible physical toil and ushered in an era of unprecedented output, speed, and precision in manufacturing - a feat that can only be perpetuated with the advancement of robotics technologies. Aside from invigorating production both in terms of quantity and quality, robots will help people take care of tedious daily tasks and free up their time for more enjoyable activities or more important priorities; in fact, machines like robot cleaners and autonomous cars are already starting to make human lives more stress-free. Finally, current medical applications of robots like bionic limbs or robot-assisted surgeries promise that they could help further human longevity.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned benefits, some people are still wary of robots, and justifiably so. The most commonly cited threat that robots pose to humans is job losses, as evidenced by how innumerable manufacturing jobs have been eliminated due to automation. In addition to jeopardizing our job security, the convenience of having machines perform various labour-intensive tasks in our stead also inadvertently makes us more sedentary. Another popular argument against robots is the doomsday scenario when machines would eventually outsmart their creators and enslave them. Given the possibility of robots imperilling our livelihood, impairing our health, and imprisoning our kind, it is no wonder that many people say this technology will wreak havoc on future societies.

Still, in my opinion, robots are a welcome innovation. Their contributions to human society are unequivocally enormous, and the concerns outlined above are either being addressed by various policies and regulations or, in the case of the doomsday scenario, proven to be far-fetched. All technologies carry a certain degree of risk, but if we had been averse to new inventions, the strides that humanity has made over the last century would never have happened.

Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"On the other hand, there are a massive amount of fake news on the Net. Unfrotunately, percentege of fake news is far higger than real news. According to a reacently study, false information coud spread more rapidly than thrue.

Visiting remote places is becoming more popular nowadays. This kind of tourism offers new opportunities to travellers but it also has its drawbacks. In this essay I shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of visiting areas where conditions are rough.

To begin with, certain landscapes and natural wonders located only in remote areas are unique and cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. No landscape is comparable to the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. If one wants to explore the wild nature and breathtaking scenery, one has to deal with difficult terrain. A clear example of that is the testimony of the Norwegian explorer Ann Straus. Straus, after enduring the perils of the Antarctic winter for 6 months describes in his biography one of the most beautiful sunrises ever seen by the human eye.  Thus, it is evident that there are some worthwhile places where conditions do not allow regular tourism.

On the other hand, venturing into wild places can be extremely dangerous as well. Many rookie adventurers and travellers perished / lost their lives while exploring unexplored lands. For example, the Red Cross warned that in the last two decades the casualties related with this kind of tourism increased by 75%. It is not hard to see that sometimes the price for venturing into such areas is too high.

To conclude, some of the most beautiful",2,4.5
Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve the environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a common belief that the use of fossil fuels in many vehicles is a cause of environmental concerns. I completely disagree that raising the price of fuel for transportation can be one of the best solutions to alleviate the environmental issues. There are several reasons why people should adopt other methods in order to solve the problems.

First of all, increasing the price of fuel can be a serious problem for  low-income individuals. In a number of developing countries, vehicles play a crucial role in the economic activities of citizens, going to far distances or commuting to work. In addition, some people in developing countries may use vehicles to ensure their work-life balance. For example, they resolve their stress through travel using cars.

Secondly. there are other factors more significantly contributing to environmental pollution. Many buildings around the world overuse electricity power from fossil fuel systems such as consistently turning on air conditioners or lights all day. Also, farmers destroy rainforests at a shocking rate in order to gain various resources and benefits. Thus, it is a more efficient solution for the governments to regulate laws and politics like these other factors.

In conclusion, Although some people believe that the best solution to mitigate environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel, I strongly disagree with this claim because I think there are other methods to relieve environmental issues.",4,5.5
Some people that competative sports shuld be included as a subject in school. while others believe that it has negative effect on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"When discussing whether competative sports should be included in school, one should bear in mind the complexity of the issue. Although some believe competative sposrts are bad for our children, because it focus on whinning rather than sportsmenship, others think it is a good way to motivate our children. I believe, competative sports are a good way to educate our children how to set a goal and achieve it. In this essay, I will provide reasons and explanations to support my opinion.   
One argument in favour of my view, is that through competative sports a child can learn to work hard in order to achieve his desires. For example, a young boy who is training for the regional swimming competition will practice twice a day, have a balanced diet to maintain his training schedual and go to sleep early so he will have enough energy for the next day. This will assist him in becomming better then the rest of his friends and he will eventually win the competition. By doing so, the child learns that working hard, even on the expense of other leisures can help him reach his goals, a lesson he can applay in every aspect of his life. This example show that competative sprts can teach our children about the importance of working hard inorder to achieve a goal.
Anoter view to support my opinion is that through competative sports, even unacomplished children can learn that they are good at something, a lesson that can help them later in life. To illustrae, a child who is not unsuccessful in school, might believe he is not good enough. However, if he realizes he can runs better then the rest of his classmates, he will learn that there are other aspect in life in which he is better then others. This can improve his confidence substantially. This example shows that competative sports can be a valuable tool teaching children about themselves. 
In conclusion, I maintain that competative sports is an important tool that can teach our children about hard work, as well as improving the selfesteem of children. Due to that, I stronly believe it should be incorporated as a subject in school.",3,5.0
The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a heated debate about road safety. Some people claim that the only way to improve road safety, taking strict measures and apply punishments for the violations. I would say road immunity is not just fenced in by limited options but some real determinative factors can be effective on it. I will declare my opinion in the following of this essay.

These days, you can hear through the press and media that thousands of people are being died on road trips. And it arouses a sense of downbeat and letdown among officials. They are seeking a way to drop this statistic. On the one hand, events that happen on the roads can be influenced by a huge variety of issues. For example, how to construct roads, and whether they follow existing standards or not. Also, another option can be the cars on the roads, whether they are modern and up-to-date with maximum security or are run-down. An outdated car besides that can be harmful to the air and environment due to pollution like exhaust fumes, and also can be the reason for road disasters and irrecoverable losses. 

On the other hand, the cause of a part of these events is human and might be to blame. It is partly brought about by disregarding grave immunity issues. Such as speaking on the telephone, being tired and sleepy, and at high speed. Sure, under these conditions, one vigorous way to decrease the events and crimes is fine and stricter punishments. 

In conclusion, I reaffirm road safety is not just surrounded by human causes. There are a lot of options that should be taken into account in order to improve the rate of immunity on roads.",8,7.5
Environmental damage is a problem in most countries. What factors damage the environment and who should take responsibility?,"Environmental pollution is one of the most imperative problems in developed and developing countries. There are a lot of activities which impact  natural habitats and their living organisms,,however the government has to unravel this problem because of its liability.

Recently, the industry's progress has had detrimental effects and it has caused  air contamination, soil degradation and water impurity. For example, an abundance number of chemical industries throw into the ocean their chemical waste and at the same time, all these wasted products lead to changes in the composition of water. In addition, the contamination of water damages all kinds of animals' habitats and today most sea animals has forced to lose their lives. On the other hand, the pollution of air content tents to an enormous amount and various types of health issues and this sort of pollution altered dramatically the quantity of O2 in the the composition of atmosphere, it is clear that it influences  global warming. At the current time,  global warming has impacted  the creation of climate change all over the world.

The majority of nations, where chemical and other sorts of factories exist should decrease producing all plants and should begin to build new factories. For instance, the government have to use new industrial systems that  enable to recycle of all products, from this point of view, the chemical or oil industries are not able to damage  the environment and human lives. In the contemporary world, by developing technological equipment all countries can establish modern factories.

To conclude, a lot of states have damaged  nature with their chemical industries and it is obvious that it appeared to be some environmental problems. By regarding this, all nations have to take care of the Earth which they have destructed it.",8,7.5
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement.","In this modern and ever-changing world, the advancement of technology like Robotics  are more popular and changing the ways people work in many countries.

People have different views with this phenomenon. Some people claimed that high-tech machines will finally take over human’s jobs whereas some people are argued that there will be a lot of jobs human do which AI are not capable to complete. Personally, I disagree with the statement becaus Artificial Robotics are not fully developed enough to cover all the jobs, like Artworks, Specialist occupations, and Musicians.

It is undeniable that the AI play an important role in people jobs in many countries. Some people are passionate about technology and are easily trapped by the convenience of high-tech. Moreover, they found it helps their business to save time and money than employ human . For example, producing newspapers and magazines. In the past decade , those tasks were completed by labour which means the companies have to employed a humen and pay salary monthly In order to run their business smoothly. Another work is doing house chores, particularly in urban society, almost everyone is not only occupied by their workload each day, but also their precious time with the children and family. Therefore, some people are grateful  and pleased for advancement of house chore machines which are valuable for the money as it has helped in terms of saving time and doing tedious house chore works.

On the other hand, there are several works that are usually being done by human. Fist and foremost, Artwork, this can be the prime example of humankind job that is will never be substituted by Argothrism intelligent procedure because Art is creativity performance from people who has have a particular talent in creating  unique Artwork. For instance, The Mona Lisa painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Secondly, a specialist job such as Doctor, Civil Engineer, and Lawyer. Those are implemented by people who has have a qualified degree to be able to work professionally and communicate with their clients is the most important part while AI robots has are incapable of interaction with human. Finally, music, as we know can only be produced by men who has have the skill like Michael Jackson who is a very well-known and successful musician in the world.

To summarize, although some people are strongly believed that all the human jobs will be taken over by AI Robots in the near future,there are a number of people who argue and think that there are several occupations which will never be cover replace by the high technology machine.In my point of view, even though some jobs are being done by the machine, nevertheless many specialist occupations which can not perform by the advance Robots.",3,5.0
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, 

while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. 

Discuss both views and give you own opinion","People held different opinions on the matter of whether museums should be a place of entertainment or education. While some people think the museum serves to entertain people, I believe people should be able to be educated after visiting the museum.

Many people consider the museum should be an enjoyable place for one main reason. The museum is a public facility that should first provide service to local people. That people are already tired after a long week of work, and they do not have the mood to gain new knowledge. What people need is a place they can leisurely and recharge their energy on holiday. 

However, I believe museums should be a place for education. Firstly, people always can find other places to entertain themself, for instance, they can go to a bar, a park, or a movie theatre. Thus we could leave the museum to those people have interested in learning new things, for example, parents can accompany their children to visit the museum after school. Secondly, the museum preserves the local cultural heritage and customs. This can attract visitors and travellers, which is good for cultural communication and the local economy.

In conclusion, there is a good reason why the museum should be a place to entertain people, but I believe museums should be educational facilities.",5,6.0
"Some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through another media platform. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is widely considered by a number of people that they prefer to stay up-to-date through traditional news sources, while others tend to seek updates from digital publishing platforms. This essay generally examines both perspectives before concluding that I am in favour of the former notion.

On the one hand, online news encompasses a wide range of sources including interviews, press releases and social media, which promptly provide up-to-the-minute updates. This variety of sources greatly allows e-newspapers to gather information in a timely manner, ensuring a comprehensive viewpoint of the discussed topic. A good example of this practice is the case of Covid-19 reports, as data on infection rates and vaccination progress in areas are immediately updated, which significantly supports individuals in making informed decisions based on the latest announcements. This effectively ensures that followers can fully catch up with all breaking news and data-driven decision-making.

On the other hand, one of the main reasons I am strongly convinced to stay informed through print media is its reliability and accessibility. These presses are required to follow a strict process of research and editorial scrutiny before publication. For instance, some outlets that are renowned for their accuracy, such as The Economist, have established credibility with their audience over decades. Additionally, newspapers' accessibility without the need for specialized devices has been ideal for those living in areas without Internet access, avoiding being cut off from current affairs. This generally fosters high-quality articles and enhances customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, while receiving news through multi-channel media offers real-time updates, I firmly believe that accessing publications through traditional papers results in greater reader confidence as they are reliable and accessible.",8,7.5
"Directors of large organizations earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others hold that it it unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Pay disparity is a growing concern in many large organizations across the world. Some people think that top-tier officials should earn higher salaries than other employees, while others reject this notion. In my opinion, the directors of these companies should be paid higher salaries. This essay will further elaborate my views and thus lead to a logical conclusion.

Many people think it is unjustifiable to pay managers a wage that is 10 times more than an employee earning the lowest salary in the company. The reason behind this thought is the member's mindset. They believe that the salary paid should be based on the employee's contribution to the growth of the company and not the position of the worker. They argue that a regular employee works much harder and even does extra hours and hence contributes more than the higher authorities towards the success of the organization. This discretion in salary creates low work loyalty and poor motivation among the staff.

However, these people do not understand that salary is not directly proportional to the amount of work done. The remuneration of the higher authorities is based on competition. The board members set a standard salary for executives on the basis of the scarcity of competent managers. Moreover, the manager has a lot of responsibilities. Even though he is a manager, he still has to manage his team, manage different projects, make and submit reports to the higher-ups, etc. Therefore, it is justifiable to pay high compensation to the directors of such organizations.

In conclusion, every employee in a company feels that everyone should be equally paid. But I believe, the managers should be paid higher than the others for the proper functioning of the institution.",7,7.0
Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.",11,9.0
"Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. 

To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays,air pollution is one of the major problems in the world.Some people believe that raising the price of gas for automobiles can solve this problem.I totally disagree with this view,since expensive gasolines can affect on individuals who rely on autos for work and other stuff.Needless to say that there are other ways to resolve this ecological concerns.

To begin with,people with low-income can be unfairly impacted by the expensive worth of autos. Individuals use cars in their daily life for many reasons.Cars are used to get to work,to travel and so on.It means that they spend a plenty of gasoline.In this case,raised price of fuel can take a bunch of money from them.For instance,to a person who earns 30 pounds for month It is too prohibited to spend casf for fuels.Because they save some money for food,clothes and other essentials.Finally,it is the wrong way to resolve the air quality concern.

 Secondly,we have various ways to deal with this trouble. There are many factors that bad affect air quality.For example,burning of garbage waste and cutting down the trees.As I see it,government should take actions on these things rather than increasing the price of fuels.Not only government,every human being can take action.For insttance,if we less burn the rubbish or plant some plants or even trees, it is our best to a better air quality.

To sum up,to my ming,instead of raising the payment of petrol,government should focus on more enormous factors.Not only government,It is our responsibility to keep our nature safe and clear.",2,4.5

Firstly, let us think about a beneficial point of this change. It is the fact that if the punishment becomes harder than in the past, car drivers would beware how to drive more, and it will generate some positive effects on walkers and bikers. For instance, Japanese government enacted more severe laws against car accident in 2018, and the number of the accidents diminished from 2018 to 2020, and this is because many drives have to concentrate on driving to avoid expensive payment. Hence, harsh rules would evoke the individuals’ caution more. 

However, perhaps this should not be the case. After all, although administers decide some strict penalties for drivers’ offences, many people would be used to drive under the severe guidelines. Furthermore, they may obtain nervous and anxiety from the rules, and it would produce more accidents. According to the dissertation done in 2020, one of the main reasons of the crimes on pathways is stress from driving and other things. In addition, they would drive slower, and it triggers traffic congestion, then the traffic jam generates adverse impacts on the citizens who used road. Thus, harsh penalties would make an increase of vehicle crimes. 

In conclusion, though making more strict punishments has the advantage, there are more disadvantages than the positive point. Therefore, I slightly disagree with this statement.",3,5.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational equality, high school students are encourage to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","while some people are of the opinion that an effective way for high school students to improve their educational quality is having a right to give feedback on their teacher’s performances, others believe that it brings about chaotic situations in class and is a disrespectful manner to teachers. I side with the former idea which will be discussed on both sides as follows:

The first advantage of commenting on the function of a teacher is that it prompts students to study their core subjects more and even be autonomous learners in order to keep abreast of their peers in commenting. Besides, an analysis of students’ feedback enables teachers to enhance their competence. To illustrate, if teachers found that students are unsatisfied with their methods, they would change them or try to make them better. Moreover, having an opportunity to express their opinion, their confidence can boost and develop their impersonal skills.

Conversely, others are again providing feedback by students since it contributes to a chaotic situation in which every student wants to say something although they are not qualified enough which might be disrespectful to teachers and makes them furious such as when a teacher is being reviewed by a low-level educated person . Moreover, this situation may result in not sticking to the rules of teachers by students. In order to prevent  such wreaking havoc in class it is better to impose some limitations. For instance, only well-educated students can have comments on their teachers’ performance.

To sum up, I hold the view that students who have options to react to their teacher’s task become more motivated to take in new things due to their competition with their peers. In addition, their confidence will increase. On the other hand, teachers can be more updated.",9,8.0
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Not being able to focus on class is one of the main concerns in the early-age learning journey. From educational perspectives, there are two main reasons which are the mismatched learning styles, and long-term exposure to poor nutrition and lack of sleep. 

Firstly, it is irrefutable that we all learn differently, and so do children. Some learn best by seeing, hearing or doing. Therefore, if the teachers only emphasize a specific learning style and apply it to all the children, this can result in a lack of focus and understanding. In this case, the solution is to ask the teachers to observe what are the options that they can choose to engage children in their learning experiences. For example, inquiry-based learning projects can be planned and adapted to search for the right methods. 

Secondly, it is sad to state, but, indeed, children cannot focus on their studies simply because they do not get enough sleep or nutrition. In fact, there are circumstances where many children do not have enough recommended sleeping hours or have to skip breakfast to be on time. Consequently, these children do not have energy and become distracted in class. As adults, we need to take our steps to reduce the numbers of children who have physical disadvantages. Government, schools and families have to work together to build up better schedules so children can have more time to sleep. Besides, they also must have free-food programs for poor children to make sure they are full when they study. 

In conclusion, there are many reasons which could lead to the failure of paying attention in the classroom. However, from my perspective, mismatched learning styles and lack of nutrition and sleep are the main causes. Together with families, governments and schools have to work on their policies in teaching methods and free-food programs to support children more.",9,8.0
Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead of going directly to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages for their studies?,"Recently, there has been a heated debate in the community about whether school leavers should go straight to university or take a gap year to travel or work for a while. In my opinion, both views have advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, working or travelling for a period of time instead of going to university directly can make those people more familiar with the working and living environment after graduation, and know the difficulties and hardships of making money, which can make them more enthusiastic about studying after entering university. And students can also take a gap year to engage in some high-tech jobs so that they can know where their knowledge is lacking, so they can focus on learning the knowledge they are not good at after entering university.

On the other hand, students do not go to college directly but go to work or travel for a period of time, which will increase their time away from campus. This will cause them a lot of trouble as they cannot adapt to campus life after they enter the university campus. They cannot focus on their studies and life, which may prevent them from passing exams or graduating. And bad habits developed during previous gap years may make their studies difficult during college.

In general, taking a gap year instead of going directly to college is also an option for students. Students need to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that they will not regret.",4,5.5
"Some people think that art is essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Arts sometimes reflect the heritage of a country and depict the creativity of an individual. While many believe that financing in the arts is a wastage of fund, I am of the opposite view as I believe that financing in the arts is a good idea for the government.


Supporters of the idea put forth that diverting funds towards arts hamper the national well-being. For example, available monetary resources could be put to use in building more hospitals, roads, infrastructure and schools. This means increasing care of the sick and improved transportation to previously inaccessible areas. For children, it caters for increased literacy rates. This group of people believes that art is a luxury and many governments cannot afford this extravagance. According to them, other important sectors require more money and hence a government should stop spending money on arts and invest in more critical areas.  

However, while investments in such areas are vital, spending on arts is equally important. Allocating money to the development and sustenance of arts helps boost the economy. Art galleries can attract tourists from all over the world, generating revenue in return. It is also the case that viewing and practising arts are good sources of venting out stress and recreate. Such activities also portray a positive picture of a nation and help to take pride in if pieces of arts become famous. If governments fail to support arts fiscally, many art galleries and theatres would not be able to survive.

Hence, it is clear to me that spending on the arts is beneficial both for an individual and society. Therefore, funding arts are not squandering money.",6,6.5
Many people use social media every day to keep in touch with friends and get social news. Do you think the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people argue that social media is very convenient for making friends and checking the latest news. As a result, people are  spending that time much more than in the past. I strongly believe that people lives are influenced by several social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram etc every day, all the time. However, the effects on people will not be good.

Nowadays, people always use social media. For example, when they are used to making friends. They can meet friends from other countries and other coulture areas. Because, social media has nolimit for country or culture. The other reson is that social media is only on the Internet. That is why people can convenient communicate with many kinds of people everywhere, such as on the desk, in cafe and in bed. As a result, people have information about many different cultures and new news in the world. It is very simple and easy.

On the other hand, news and other information is taken by social media very easily. And, the information make it easy for anybody can make news and other information. People accept the information with do not filter and do not affort. They do not know that the information is true or fake. And then, the information sprayed on the social media.A few times later, the infrmation has siginificatly increased. If the information of fake news will sprayed, the news would not important that is fake or true. That will be made true by people. Also,  if people will be increase to meet people via the internet by social media.  It would be more difficult to meet people with face to face. Because, people do not have little experience face to face.

In conclusion, as mentioned above, I think that social media has disadvantages.",3,5.0
"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Currently, the money spent has always been the topic of interest. While some claim that money invested in developing technology to discover space is not justified, the opposite makes a statement that there are more tremendous benefits to spending this money. I consider myself an advocate of this statement that the government should invest this money in other aspects.

There are a wealth of reasons why it is not necessary to spend money to explore space. Not all countries can afford to fund this aspect. Because the money spent on this program is prohibitively exorbitant and can not be used for other purposes. Moreover, this also pollutes the environment when the emissions in experiments are released into the air. As a result, this money should be used to find methods to restore the environment to save our planet.

Moreover, there is a myriad of ways to fund this money more rationally such as investing in education. It is undeniable that education is the backbone industry of the nation. A lot of students do not have enough financial abilities to get access to school. So this money can change their student life so that they can have the opportunity to broaden their horizons.

In conclusion, although there are some redeeming features in space exploration, the environmental problem and poverty to go to school are more necessary.",6,6.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","It is true that nowadays an increasing amount of population starts to think about the history behind their homes. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, and people can conduct the survey through various methods. 

There are three main reasons why people start trying to figure out the stories behind their houses. Firstly, with social economic development, people start to pay more attention to their cultural life, of which the history of buildings is an interesting part. Secondly, cities and countries see more immigrations nowadays, and these people are not familiar with the culture of the places they move to. Therefore, it would be a good start to learn about the history of the houses they are living in. For example, I was told my dormitory was actually built on the site of a palace of the Tang Dynasty when I moved to my university in the ancient city Xi’an. It made me really excited and then I spent a large amount of time effort to find information about it. Finally, for businessmen, a profound history might make a location more valuable so that they can sell the houses for a better price.

There are several ways to search the history of a building. The most quickest and easiest way is to check online. Just type your location and what you are looking for, you will see a large quantity of information in front of you. Besides using the Internet, one can also ask the old people who have lived there since they were young. These local residents will definitely tell some vivid stories about the place where they grow up. Also, for those who are good at reading, it is a practical method to look for archives of the city and the building in the library.

In conclusion, to learn about the culture, to get familiar with a new place, and to add value to the houses are three main reasons that push people find the past of their house or building, and they can do this online, through asking the old or in the library.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or the building they live in. 


What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Information about the history of the buildings is demanded to be known by the residents in some states. The primary reasons are that it is necessary to submit the original data to authority before the renovation is carried out and those information can be obtained on government website in most cases and from previous owners in some cases.

One of the necessities before the purchase of a building or a flat is to get to know in-depth details of the building and its background history. Without knowing them, the owner has to take certain risks to do some kinds of renovations because the submission to building authority is mandatory in some countries before any alteration is made. Besides, some original features left by the previous owner are irreplaceable and any destruction of them can be undone. For instance, a friend of mine renovated his own flat, that he bought just before the renovation, without knowing that the old sculpture is Chinese original feature and it is very hard to find nowadays. Now he is very keen to know about how his flat is built by the previous owner.

Regarding the history of building, one of the easiest ways to research is to ask the real estate agent or the house seller. They know very in-depth history of the house they are selling without doubt so that the buyer can get to know before making decision to purchase. Another reliable source is the government website where all records are kept and archived. The obvious example is that the URA space, a virtual map which shows data in visualised presentation, was launched by one of the Singapore government bodies in 2005. It can be used to know the previous records of each and every land lot which are vital important for the buyer to know before they purchase the land parcels.

To summarise, this is very positive that many house owners are keen to know the history of the building or the flat they are residing. Getting to liaise with authority for house renovation and their willingness to avoid the destruction of authentic signatures are motivating them to explore the records of their own buildings and they can do some research on the government websites and can ask the house agents if they are comfortable to talk to them.",3,5.0
some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid communuty work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Nowadays youth generation are very powerfull, independent and one step forward in every field, situation and work. Few mankind claims that youngsters should be ready to giving helping hand in community work without any cost. So it will be win-win situation for teenagers as well as community. To larger extent I will agree with the given statement which i elaborate in trail paragraphs.

To commence with, first and foremost fruitfull benefit is gain experience in work in small age. They can work in every field like Food packing, Medicine packing and etc. As a result, the level of knowledge and experience will be accumulate. Another benefit is that, youngster will meet a new person so personal contact is create. Thus, communication skills are also increased. To put in simple word, they are familier with new language, new culture and new people. Therefore, the way of communication is gain and they can able to fluent speech in another language.

Moreover, some younster can give free schooling to poor people so they will improve their knowledge and share it with other students. So poor people also can learn and study. Furthermore, if teenagers are ready to help to work community in their leisure time then community do not need to waste their money in salary and they can use that in another work.

On the other hand, because of help juveniles can not focus on their study and extra curriculum activity. In addition, they do not have enough time to play with their friends and fulfill their hobby and dream. So their study will suffer, at the end they can not archieve their goals.

On the close scrunity, I conclude that work with community without paid, it ruin study and personal interest. However, I believe that help to community is improve knowledge, experience, communication skills which is very helpfull for bright future. It is the best way to use leisure time instead of waste it in non-beneficial activity.",1,4.0
There is no need to go out to see live performance (concert...) because it is better to see them on the TV or Computer screen. Do you agree or disagree,"An emerging trend which has generated a widespread phenomenon in the entertainment field is watching home movie. I am inclined to believe that watching movies on screens is much better than coming to the social cinema. Not only will watching movie at home help us to save our precious time, but it can also be a private area to enjoy TV series.

To look at the entertainment aspect, the most important factor to consider is the daily form of recreation. If a person has his or her private applications or websites to relax against some pillows while watching the movies, it will be one of the best option for them to save an amount of huge money instead of uncomfortable going direct to the social cinema. Such a form of entertainment, moreover, will create a private place for us to watch wonderful movies without irritating the others intensely. The more people are around, the more bad emotional feelings we will get. It is true that we always find confidence and truly happy whenever we can gather with friends or family members, which can be destroyed while watching in the social cinema with strangers. In order to avoid this situation, all we need to do is self-quarantine, find a great Tv show and relax.

With that being said, everything always has its defective sides and it is pretty true on home-movie watching. What really makes audience truly boring about the film is a distraction. Assuming a person is watching his favourite movie, he might be momentarily distracted by social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or even the notification of messages which is pretty unpleasant. Watching movies in our private area can affect negatively on our routine, we might be immersed in blockbuster movies or Tv series and be lazy. Moreover, Blue light from computer screens will cause some contemporary symptoms such as eye strain, blur vision or headache.

In conclusion, watching the movie is on the rise,  and watching movie on computer trend brings both advantages and disadvantages to our self and the others. Moderation is the key to remain the balance and solve these problems effectively.",1,4.0
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is the possibility of viewing the web of companies as a multitude of money gaining apparatus, however, according to some, firms have also a duty to benefit the public in some manner. There is reasonable argumentation for both perspectives.

Those who believe in commitment of enterprises for the wider community think that it is vital for the welfare of the society. This way various issues concerning the society become coped with to some extent. Businesses get forced to tackle problems like climate change or unemployment of those with disabilities. For example, in Lithuania supermarkets like “Rimi” try to employ humans from this group and sell more eco-friendly products in order to reach their social responsibility goals. On the contrary, without an imperative to positively impact the society some corporations might harm it. For instance, “Coca-Cola” could be a company that just offers beverages, which contain high amounts of sugar and cause health problems like obesity as a result, and gain profit out of that. 

	However, the pressure for fulfilling duties for the public might hinder the economical flourishing of enterprises whose main focus differs from its expected actions. Although it can be seen as negative that some corporations only focus on improving their economy, this can increase the total welfare of the country, according to some philosophies. Economists argue that economical growth, which correlates with high figures of thriving firms, causes the social welfare to rise. Additionally, a diversification of specialization of companies might be sufficient. In most lands there are a lots of social businesses, which could be funded more to accomplish desired results. 

	In conclusion, seeking for social responsibility of firms could turn out to be positive for the people from one perspective, but economical principles should be taken into account. Maybe most enterprises should strive for achieving completion of some adequate amount duties for the public, but social businesses should act as the leader in this sphere.",2,4.5
Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"International aid is a voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another. I disagree with the given statement that governments should not give aid to poor countries if there are underprivileged people within their own country. I believe that the developing and developed countries should always step forward to help the impoverished countries.

My first argument is that if unemployment and homelessness are the criteria for not giving aid, then there would be no support on humanitarian grounds at all. Some degree of unemployment and homelessness is there even in the most developed countries such as the USA and the UK. If such nations stop giving aid, then there would be no one to help the poverty stricken world. For instance, according to statistics of 2013, nearly 6% people in the USA were unemployed, but aid given by the USA was $30 billion approximately. Even the developing countries such as India have allocated some part of their budget for foreign aid.

Secondly, most aid indirectly helps the donor country, such as for resource extraction from the recipient country or to gain some commercial access. For example, the MNCs opened in India as a part of foreign assistance, no doubt, are providing jobs to many youngsters, but in fact is paying them much less than what they have to pay their own country’s employees. Many foreign companies have opened their retail outlets in India because India is a strong commercial market due to its burgeoning population. Therefore, aid works as a win-win situation for both the giver and the taker countries.

Furthermore, in emergencies or natural calamities such as earthquakes and tsunamis, all nations should come forward and help. Aid need not be monetary; it can be in the form of volunteer workers or providing goods needed by the affected people. Such help should be given even if there are situations within the nation needing attention. This also strengthens relations between countries.

To sum up, I reiterate my opinion saying that all countries should help by giving foreign aid, even if there are problems of unemployment and homelessness within them.",8,7.5
Films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the era of digitalization,movies and video games are very popular.Nowadays,most   movies and machine games which contain killing are in demand.It is often argued by a few individuals that online games and videos which are based on  fighting scenes should be forbidden.However,  groups of people think that videos and mobile games are sources of entertainment.This essay will explore  both sides' perspectives before reaching to logical opinion.

On the one hand,it has widely accepted that computer gaming and video tapes with some scenes of killing humans are leaving negative impacts on society.Furthermore,the proponents of this approach assert that such types of graphic clips are provoking the level of intolerance in the community.As a result, it has been observed that in the last few, decades the incidents of murder are increasing day by day.The main reason behind this  the aggression of youth  is learned through such types of movies and games.For example,nowadays,a mobile game   name  PUBG is extremely famous among  children.The tasks in this game given to players are consisted of killing humans.Because of such ,features youth are being more addicted to this game.Moreover, when we come to movies which contain some aggressive actions done by the villain of films.people tend to copy the action of their dearest characters in movies.

On the other hand, few think that this is for enjoyment and relaxation.They support their claim with the argument that it is true most people feel relaxed when they win a game or watch any of their favourite movies.In ,addition it totally depends on the person,s choice whether he wants to play a puzzle game or a violent contained game,and the same case is with  cinema.For instance,to recapitulate the above-mentioned example in paragraph two.A person who plays PUBG for amusement and  wins some golden badges in that game  may result in to help  to mitigate his stress level.

To conclude, I am of the opinion that the outcomes of such movies and games are more detrimental in comparison to their advantages and such kinds of games and movies should be banned.",8,7.5
the only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offences. To what extent do you agree or disagree? ,"Some people believe that giving much stricter sentences on traffic offences is the only way to improve road safety. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement as I think there are other effective measures that can also tackle this problem. 
On the one hand, imposing stricter punishments on traffic law-breakers could be seen as an effective way of road safety. This is because it may deter drivers from violating traffic laws regulations. In fact, some people, especially adults exceed the speed limit, leading to a lot of serious traffic accidents. Therefore, giving many stringent punishments should be enacted. Also, those who drive while intoxicated or using mobile phone deserve to be banned from the road. In recent years, Viet Nam has many heart-breaking traffic accidents due to the lack of awareness of drivers who use too much alcohol. If there are fewer drivers breaking traffic laws, the roads may become safer for all road users. 
On the other hand, there are other alternative measures which would also be effective. Authorities could, for example, install more surveillance and speed cameras to make potential law-breakers aware of the need to abide by speed limits. This measure is crucial in many cities as a way to keep people committing illegal actions. Another sustainable measure is upgrading the transportation infrastructures mainly because the low-quality state of roads and streets are the factor culprits of the occurrence of numerous traffic accidents. For instance, in Viet Nam, there are many people falling off when their motorbikes go over a big pot-hole. 
In conclusion, in order to enhance road safety, it is not enough to be tough on traffic crimes by punishing harshly those violating the law. Personally, to achieve the best results, the combination of the aforementioned ideas is the most effective strategy.

Write about the following topic.Bullying is a big problem in many schools.What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.",6,6.5

This essay discusses some of the causes for this as well as how the public can encounter this information.

firstly, if there is any historical value to the place, it increases the market price of the dwelling. Therefore, when reselling, knowing history comes in handy. Some people need a connection to the house where they live in, to feel it is their home. For that reason, knowing the narrative is useful. For example, most horror movies are based on a ghost who used to live in that particular building where the main characters chose to inhabit. Therefore, as long as the memoir of the place is innocent community find it easy to live. Moreover, having awareness of when it was built, what materials were used, where it has been altered, and how the structure was used prevents unexpected disasters and helps with repairs, alterations and maintenance.

Secondly, to find out the story behind a place, public can use many options. Most of time, old structures are listed in local authorities. Searching property records can be a best option. As well as, nowadays there are online platforms where anyone can obtain information about past events. But, the easiest and most reliable way to find the background of a house is to get information from the residential senior citizens.

"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Reported 2017, Academic Test)","Numerous people claims that to decrease global environmental can be solve with the high cost of the fuel. In my opinion, I agree with this case, yet, it can lead to benefits and drawbacks at the same time.

Environmental problems are extremely crucial issues in national and global scope such as climate change that could drive many natural disasters. This issue was connected with the used of traditional energy sources such as fuel, coal, and others. Therefore, one of the solution that can be implement is by increasing the cost of fuel. For instance, nowdays transportation is one of the most highest why fuels are consume for. Hence, the raise cost of fuel can detach people to use another alternative transport that support sustainability.

On the other hand, fuel is the essential source to use in many aspects. Consequently, the rose of cost of fuel could be affect many sectors.

Then, it will brought an impact to our financial standart. So, it is immensely for stakeholders to be more innovative that can used renewable energy while the cost is still can be affordable.

To conclude, increasing the cost of fuel could be the effective way to tackle environmental problems. Although, there will convoy many sectors to more adapt with their financial needs.",0,<4

Some think that government should support retired people financially while others believe they should  take care of themselves. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"An array of people believe that the retired community shall be supported financially by the state and some say that is not and they should be self-supported. I strongly admit that there should be a government financial scheme to support the retired crowd and both views are discussed in detail below.

On the one hand,  social security is a very important factor in any country. The state should look after the children as well as the elderly population to ensure the well-being of the nation. Just take an elderly individual who devoted his whole life to the betterment of the country. He or she may be an engineer, teacher, doctor, farmer or a housewife and dedicated their own  energy to developing the country for a long period. I strongly believe that dedication should be paid off financially when those are retired.Hence it is very important to establish a social security fund to look after the retired generation.

On the other hand, some public says that everyone should save plenty of money while they work, to use during the latter part of their life instead of expecting state financial support. That is individuals are expected save a certain percentage of their own earnings for themselves, instead of spending all for their families. That can also be materialised, if their earnings are sufficient enough and this could relieve the government from the burden of looking after adults. However, as all cannot afford the cost of living while saving for themselves  some kind of state-owned fund is a must to look after the aged generations.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this period of technology, many individuals argue that news has no connection to people’s lives. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this notion, and my opinion will be discussed in further paragraphs. After which I will lead to a logical conclusion.

Supporting my disagreement to the given statement, I firmly believe that digital newspaper or traditional newspaper play an important role in people’ live nowadays. In the light of the fact that this can help people get more information happened in that day around the earth. To cite an example, if we do not read a newspaper we cannot know about the war between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, watch television news programs like BBC or CNN can help individual gain more knowledge about rules or policy. For instance, in Viet Nam there is a news channel called VTV1 starts at 19:00 every day, this channel contains overall information in Viet Nam and around the world in general to convey back to Vietnamese people.

Explaining some of the another supporting points in against this statement, it is true that watching news on televisions every day or read newspaper can help global citizen can know what happened around the world or in their country. As a consequence, people who live far away from their motherland can see special events via a TV or read the digital newspaper. Thus, that can make them feel less homesick when they are far away.

To sum up, reading the newspaper or watching televisions news programs do not waste people’s time, they make individuals gain more knowledge. I believe that aforementioned points are strongly supporting my view of points",3,5.0
"Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping will help us to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today.
Speaking about traffic problems, I always think about Moscow. No town I have ever been in has such a big trouble with road traffic. A huge quantity of public transport types, a few cars for one family, all of it creates a constant flow of traffic.
Of course the increase popularity of IT-jobs and freelance helps people to spend more time home. The Home-office concept appeared relatively recently but a lot of people choose it already. I think after pandemic this type of work will be the only viable option.
The same situation is observed with education process. The almost a year pupils and students spend in Zoom and Skype. It's hard for me to say if online study has the same quality as a physical communication with the teacher in the audience. But the time savins are obvios.
I can't disagree that home office and online studies will help us to avoid daily traffic jams. But also I wouldn't say that it's the only way.
When city infrastructure gives me a possibility to get to the place by foot, I would love to do it. If the city provides an opportunity to ride bicycles or scooters a lot of people would try it. In this way some people will leave the car at the garage. It seems to me that alternative types of transport become more popular each day. If the city goverment will support this trend, the amount of traffic will reduce without any additional measures.",7,7.0
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people believe that we are more reliant on others currently, while others argue people live independently nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent the people were in the past.

There are two main reasons why some people consider today’s society  a more dependent one. The first one is that life seems to be more complex and difficult, with  inflation  getting quicker, our living costs are also getting higher. For example,  house price has increased dramatically in recent years, so without the help of their parents, it seems impossible for young people to buy a house of their own. Moreover, people are more ambitious today, and many parents spend most of their time making money in order to offer better life quality for their families, so they sometimes end up letting grandparents or babysitters look after their children .

However, I would agree with those who believe people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people can not count on their families as much as they used to. We also have more freedom and opportunities to travel around the world, for instance, many students choose to study or work abroad  these days, so without the company of their families or friends, they need to rely on themselves. Another reason contributing to this independence is  advanced technology, people can work remotely or work alone from any part of the world. 

In conclusion, even though some people consider us dependent on each other nowadays, I would argue that due to the reason mentioned above, people are more independent than ever.",6,6.5
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The world is now surrounded by many urgent environmental problems, and many people feel that raising the cost of fuel is one of the most effective ways of combatting them. Although I tend to agree with this viewpoint, I believe there are other environmental measures that need to be taken. 

Increasing petrol prices would help save the environment in many ways. As the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing dramatically, so is the amount of vehicular emissions released into the atmosphere. However, if governments increase fuel costs, this solution would serve as a deterrent for people who drive their private cars, reducing air pollution and ozone layer depletion. Besides discouraging people from driving their private cars, this would also generate income to make further investments in environmental initiatives. Given these potential benefits of raising fuel prices, is it hardly surprising to see so many countries applying it to practice.

Apart from increasing the cost of fuel, we can also implement other solutions to environmental issues. For instance, on an individual level, people who want to help the environment should become more environmentally responsible by buying eco-friendly products, and reusing and recycling plastic bags. They can also take public transport as opposed to their personal cars, which produce toxic fumes. From a government’s perspective, it is essential to switch to green energy sources, such as solar and wind, rather than continuing to rely on gas and petrol. Thus, environmental protection goes beyond just raising fuel prices. 

In conclusion, though I attach great importance to the practice of increasing fuel costs, I think that both individuals and governing bodies should become environment-oriented in their mindset to tackle environmental problems.",8,7.5
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"In this day and age, several advertising campaigns are launched by many brands or businesses in order to improve their profit. Advertisements from those companies have massive impacts on customers, and there are , however, numerous practical solutions to solve this problem. 

Consumers can easily be affected by the huge number of advertisements that they encounter every day. Nowadays, commercials are shown almost everywhere and one might have to see it even when he or she does not want to. Being exposed to too many advertisements can be a frustrating experience, especially when these adverts interfere with people’s watching their favorite shows on TV or social media platforms. Moreover, with an enormous number of advertisements, many people, especially the younger generation may be lured to spend a lot of money on what they do not really need. If this extends over a long period, customers may have to be burdened with debts.

Nevertheless, there are lots of measures which can be taken to tackle these issues. First, in order to protect purchasers from being lied to, the government ought to control the contents of these advertisements to make sure that they are appropriate. Furthermore, consumers can protect themselves by considering all the related factors carefully before deciding to make a purchase. They should do a detailed research about the product to ensure that they pay for what they really need. 

In conclusion, purchasers may be negatively influenced by advertisements that are shown to them. However, both the government and consumers can take measures to impede this problem.",5,6.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss and give your opinion.","It is argued whether supporting secondary school students for assessing their teachers in the pursuit of improving educational quality would result in disrespect and indiscipline in the classroom. From my point of view, students' participation in teacher appraisal is definitely helpful, but it should be administrated properly.

On the one hand, it is true that feedback from learners may contribute to an improvement in educational quality. To begin with, this policy allows teachers to enhance their performance. When learners are entitled to evaluate their teachers, they enable a teacher to realize the weaknesses of his or her teaching method, improving their performance. In addition, by properly adjusting their approach to education, teachers may motivate students to dig deeper into their favourite fields. For example, at some high schools, after integrating such high-tech as computers and projectors into teaching, the student participation rate has been significantly increasing.

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks of allowing adolescents to gauge their teachers. Firstly, teachers can be vulnerable to the negative words of students. Being bombarded with students' poor evaluation, lecturers feel stressed, exhausted and may give up their career when their efforts are no longer be recognized. Furthermore, the classroom may be in chaos due to massive numbers of comments. Opinions vary from students to students, and it would be impractical for teachers to work out a way of teaching that can satisfy all students.

In conclusion, students' judgements provide an important source of data for evaluating teachers, helping them to discover their disadvantages and improve their performance. However, schools should give appropriate guidance and not allow excessive evaluation to become a window for students to vent their dissatisfaction.",7,7.0
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of population who are aged 15 and younger. What is your opinion of the current and future effects it may have in those countries ?,"An essential aspect of the country's overall development is the proportional distribution of its people by age. In many nations, the number of young residents under the age of 15 has increased dramatically and this has had detrimental impacts on society, the labour force and the country as a whole.

The development has the consequence of increasing competition in schools. Due to the intense virally, it will be difficult for parents to reputable schools since the majority of the younger generation needs to attend those educational institutions. Many poor parents, consequently, will be obliged to send their offspring to work to earn sufficient money at a young age, which will exacerbate the exploitation of child labour in many developing and underdeveloped countries. A further drawback is that the age disparity in these nations will result in a shortage of professional and qualified labourers. In industries, such as medicine, construction and aviation, that require a great deal of experience; it is difficult for children to produce exceptional discoveries due to their lack of competence and long-term experience.

However, despite the aforementioned negative repercussions, this propensity is not necessarily a burden. The youth, in my opinion, can support the community through their creativity, responsiveness and inquisitiveness. Considering this trend's ramifications, I feel it will be economically advantageous. In reality, many nations are in desperate need of ample people resources to perform manufacturing and building work. Countries with an enormous number of adolescents will contribute significantly to the countries' human resources, which not only boosts the domestic economy but also attract foreign's investments. In addition, young individuals are frequently energetic and sensitive to new technologies, therefore, I believe that the trend of the young population will assist the country in absorbing new initiatives and effectively implementing them in the host nation.

In conclusion, the tendency of a youthful population can lead to the exploitation of child labour and a lack of human resources in highly skilled fields. Nonetheless, I suppose this tendency can assist  economic development and contribute to the nation's prosperity through technological advancements",9,8.0
"Some people say that the increasing business and cultural contact between countries is positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In this day and age, it is universal truth that commercial and cutural interaction has an inseperable relationship with the growth of any aspects of each country. However, whether developing it has always been a topic of general public. While a number of people argue that promoting communication between these regions may carry some  potential dangers for identity, others have a contrary-minded that it will significantly create superb results in world's connection. Personally, I contend that the benefits that globalization brings about outweighs the drawbacks.

On the one hand, it is understandable that why some groups of community believe that the interconnection between countries will take a heavy toll on the national recognition. The key rationale is that as foreign influences, especially the Western cultures that permeate other societies, more people will embrace intriguingly external ideas and start to consider that their conventional custom as obsolete, which may probably result in a loss of the national true values. However, this thinking is totally exaggerated. As far as I am concerned, instead of marginalizing the traditional values of every country, the globalization has given a larger range of chance for citizens all over the world to introduce and open their own culture to other friends. Korea perfectly exemplifies this situation. The widespread presence of entertainment companies and TV programmes, specifically the ""Hallyu wave"", has been the key to foster and promote a global appreciation towards this country. This is a testament to positive impacts of world's contact on a country's values.

On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the global development will offer stupendous advantages. In terms of business, many entrepreneurs can expand the foreign markets. As a result, many jobs are created which will directly improve people's living standards. To give a clear example, the contribution of SamSung in VietNam has hostically addressed the unemployment of a plethora of people. In addition to this, in terms of culture, the integration among these areas will mitigate many social problems which occurs on a regualr basis. To exemplify, the thinking of Western's community will gradually turn the gender inequality sentiments on Asia society's head. Therefore, it seems sensible that we can broaden our mind towards a harmonized development. 

In conclusion, while the exchange in tradition as well as trading still exist some disadvantages, it is irrefutable that the global changing has created many significant benefits for each and everyone. It is also clear that the traditional values can be separately maintained in tandem with the global integration.",5,6.0
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by Artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Artificially intelligent machines are replacing humans in the workforce shortly. However, the robots can indeed do some of the jobs but, some other works, need a human presence.  This essay will discuss why some of the functions should rely on humans rather than on robots.

In nearly future, the robots will take over the tasks that do not need complex or critical professional skills. Accurately programmed robots can execute the work more smoothly than humans  also without errors. For example, an automated teller machine for deposit and withdraw money in no time that tremendously eradicated human inversions. For these reasons, the artificially intelligent robots or computers will substitute humans in some areas. 

There are still some tasks that need human talents for proper functioning. The areas like medical, social, and physiology need to be carried out by skilled people furthermore,  some fields need crucial and critical decisions that are only being possible by human interaction. Robots are pre-programmed machines so they cannot take decisions on such situations that they are not programmed. For instance, in the medical field, the foremost surgeries are carried out by doctors themselves, even though there are humanoids to do minor.  Based on this, there exist some jobs where cyborgs cannot replace people.

In conclusion, humanoids will potentially succeed humans in the most workforce. However, the areas need critical thinking as well as a crucial decision will be performed only by humans. In my opinion, there are some work sectors where human presence is necessary moreover humanoids are man-made things.",9,8.0
"in some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Knowing about historical buildings is highly adopted by numerous  population. However , when it comes to the places that they are living in it becomes more fascinating to search about it. Because it is the field that they grow up in ,and it is believed that the better location to start your historical journey is your home town. In this essay  the reasons why people have a passion for finding out information about their homes and where they can find some resources to extract the knowledge .

Firstly, having large data regarding history will increase the knowledge of the person, it is considered that the more you know ; the more you are valuable in society .

  Furthermore , mankind is trying to hold their culture and  heritage  by knowing more and more about their original background and houses. Consequently ,

On the other hand , as we are living in the age of technology ,people can search on Google where every piece of information is provided. But sometimes it could be inaccurate , therefore the first one is better.

Some people think that governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"A group of individuals believe that country’s officials have to shed light on minimizing the toxicity of the environment and households and cure citizen from getting sick. I strongly believe that government officials must putting their energy on tackling the toxicity on the air and households need because of two reasons which are locally and internationally.

The main reason why I believe that government have to solve the problem of toxicity in the air and their citizen’s housing is because they have a local duties toward citizen which means that themselves are obliged to offers these needs. Furthermore, countries should have go after citizen needs and one of the fundamental needs are to live in area where the air is clean and to have a place to sleep. Despite the fact, that government’s officials are citizen at the end.

Another reason why I think that countries need to solve any problem related to environment and household so because they have an international duties toward their citizens. Obviously, most of the countries are in the United Nations and to be member countries have to agree to the United Nation’s rule. In fact, most of the rules are talking about what are the human needs such – housing, jutice, safety, and health -; therefore, all countries must offer these needs to their citizen.

In conclusion, I completely admit that governments must solve any problem related to environment and household; apparently, this is because themselves have local and international obligations. I highly recommend countries to take care of their citizen’s walfare.",2,4.5
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Environmental pollution has been a major concern in today’s society, and to mitigate this problem some people argued that the best way to solve the global environmental issues is to raise the price of oil to deal with the problem. While I believe that it may help to improve the environment matter to a certain extent, other steps are essential to face the issue.

To begin with,  increasing the price of petrol can help reduce environmental pollution to some degree. This is because the excessive use of the vehicle produces the most amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment. If the price of oil is increased, individual people will stop using their cars to reduce the cost. However, the rise in fuel cost always determines the market prices of all goods and this increasing prise of consumers hit most to the middle class and poor families. I believe that the increase in the cost of fuel will not stop environmental pollution.

On the other hand, governments can take other measures to deal with the issue. Firstly, governments can increase funding to find an alternative source of energy such as solar panels, wind energy. To illustrate this the CEO of Tesla and Solar Energy ""Elan Mask"" said, that if the government funds his project of solar panels, he will completely able to remove the dependency on non-renewable resources like coal and petrol. And also solar power in the USA has proven its efficiency in energy production. Secondly, the government can encourage more people to switch to electric cars to protect the environment.

In conclusion, I believe that to increase the cost of fuel is not an appropriate way to solve the environmental problem. Renewable energy sources are better alternatives to deal with this issue, and authority can motivate people to use an electric car.",9,8.0
Many jobs in the home that used to be done by hand can now be done by machines. Has this development brought more advantages or more disadvantages?,"Nowadays, many people are using machines to do many things in the house instead of using their hands like 20 years ago. This new change of using machines in the home has some advantages and some disadvantages. I will discuss this and explain why using machines to do jobs in the house has more advantages for people. 

Life is busy and using machines at home is very normal for people because there are many benefits. Washing clothes or dishes by hand like before was harmful to people and give them allergies. This is because washing detergent has chemicals in it and it can result in health problems. Also jobs in the house can be done more quickly which is another advantage of using a machine. For example, washing a big load of white clothes needs lots of hot water to soak and then brush each cloth, rinse it and then dry which can easily take 2 hours and the machine can do it in 45 minutes. 

On the other hand, using machines is not cheap as we must expect some repairs. Moreover, technology is always changing and we have new models in the market and we have to keep on buying new machines and it is a disadvantage. For example, I first brought an oven to bake cakes, but now airfryer has a baking option so I had to buy that too. This way, I have picked up many products because of new technology. But, it is good as we can use our credit card and get on instalments so not bad at all. 

To sum up, machines are a very good development as jobs can be done quickly and can avoid touching chemicals. I feel the advantages is anytime more than the disadvantage of buying over and over or repairing it.",7,7.0
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","Numerous people have argued that school should teach a lot of skills in daily life such as cooking, dressmaking, or woodwork, not only focus on academic achievement as well as examinations. In this essay, I will explain why I tend to agree with this statement. 

On the one hand, learning essential subjects like math, biology, and language is most likely the main purpose of every school in this entire world, yet the hope of parents. Based on the statement by UNDP, courses like math, biology, and language are the foundation of children’s part of growing both in analytical thinking and emotional thinking. Moreover, the ability of children to count is because they learn math at school, their communication skill is level up because they learn a language subject at school, and they are aware of the natural environment because they learn it in biology. 

On the other hand, school should be the best place for students to learn everything, including learning hard or soft skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodwork. This idea could be added in extracurricular activities. Looking at SKY High School in South Korea, this school even has 30 clubs for extracurricular activities. The teachers also believe that the students can be rich by having a lot of skills to help them get accepted in high-ranked universities. Turns out, 60% of students in SKY High School get accepted in top 3 universities in Korea and Global because of some competitions in soft skill and hard skill like cheerleading, computing, and boxing.

In conclusion, learning cannot be lacking in various subjects only. It is absolutely important to consider theoretical achievement in examinations, but it will be more beneficial if students can master both in academic and non-academic areas.",4,5.5
"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In line with the development of the era, space science and technology has significantly improved. However, some skeptics believe that this investment is wasteful and useless because humans have an array of issues that need tackling with that amount of money instead. From my perspective, I agree with that idea to a certain extent.  

There are some main reasons why the budget for space discovery is considered unnecessary. Firstly, in order to invent more modern technology, product and launch space transportation, various nations have spent the resident's tax on employing scientists, which makes the discontentment occur. Meanwhile, citizens hope the government uses their task to measure social problems, poverty, illiteracy and pandemic for instance. Secondly, besides the economic aspect, the more space exploration develops, the more pollution it results in. A ton of fossil fuels is needed for one trip to the universe, hence, this amount of carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere once the spaceship has been launched. Furthermore, outdated satellites which are not able to come back to the Earth become space junk as a symbol of waste. 

Despite far more disadvantages, space tourism has some benefits. Research about the universe and other planets can help people widen the horizon, gain deeper insight into the Milky Way, and thus satisfy human’s curiosity. Satellites also provide the prediction of weather and natural disasters which is useful on a daily basis. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that although space discovery brings human life advantages, governments and residents ought to prioritize solving human and environmental issues on the Earth.",7,7.0
"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.
One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.
Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.
Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.
In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.",7,7.0
Some people think that the only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offences. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that the only way to enhance road safety is to increase punishments for drivers. I disagree with this view because many drivers may still violate the driving rules when they receive a chance even though the penalty is high and educating their mindset could be another possible way to solve this issue.

It is true to say that  a large number of drivers  break safety rules whenever they obtain a chance. Although governments and authorities are used to control the most sophisticated equipment , many of them are not interested to follow those laws because in their opinion some rules are not relevant and impractical. Moreover, some traffic police are also intended to charge a high amount of money to drivers rather than educating them . In Thailand , for example ,  larger numbers of drivers are paying  money to traffic police instead of obeying the laws and that could lead to the  corruption problem as well. Unless governments are taking serious action ,  public road safety could not expect to get better.

Undoubtedly , educating is more effective than punishing if we want to improve road safety.Obviously , changing the public mindset is not an easy task because governments and authorities might need to invest a large amount of time and money as well. Even though the investment is huge , we could receive better outcomes like fewer road accidents . In the UK, for instance, a wide range of educating  roads safety awareness and guidelines can reduce a significant amount of accidents in some major cities .

To conclude,even though some people say that  more punishments for careless drivers can improve road safety , a lack of proper education  can  still remain this problem in the future. Unless  we educate the public , we would not resolve the problem.",9,8.0

Some section of people believe it has a good influence  whereas others feel it should not be continued.

This essay will discuss  both perspectives on financial support to third-world countries and mention why I believe that the former opinion is the best practice.

To begin with,  helping people from a country  in need will develop a positive relationship between the nations and can uplift the spirits of its citizens. This can build a strong relationship among the countries which can lead to a better world. Suppose a country in need was left out by other nations, the suffering of people can affect negatively and build hatred towards society. For instance, India helped Sri Lanka during the economic crisis in 2020 and it has developed a strong bond between those two nations. These two countries support each other in multiple socio-economic situations.

On the other hand, allocating a budget to help needy nations can cause strain on the economy of the helping country. The government has to adjust its funds from certain departments to the service sector and it can halt some major projects due to lack of funding. For example, India has postponed one of its prestigious space projects due to a lack of budget after providing aid to Sri Lanka.

To conclude, in my opinion, it is necessary to help  needy countries even though there are certain disadvantages to supplying the nation as the positive impact outweighs the negatives.",7,7.0

To commence with, some people are so connected with their culture so they never miss any opportunity to find out ancient things . They are several behind this approach of people. Firstly, some masses are so curious about the fact that where there ancestors used to live , how they used to live that is why they conduct research in their primitive inhabitants. Another reason could be mentioned here is that , when people read any book related to history and ancient historical events these both thing provoke their desires to know more about old buildings and some other things. Hence, people look for examination on old infrastructures.

On the other hand, there are several ways by which people can feed their willingness about old home and buildings. Firstly, people can take help of archeological experts in order to find the precise history about old monuments and infrastructures. secondly, people should visit to their native places if they really want to check out the real value of ancient things. Lastly, there are a number of publications on history of old sculptures masses can take help of these books to examine their own old buildings.

Children find it difficult to pay attention or concentrate on school study what are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, children face difficulties concentrating in school classes and their studies. There are a number of reasons why they don’t focus on studying. That, I will explain and give a solution to the problem.

There are many causes why pupils don’t pay attention to school studies. The first reason is the syllabus of the semester. To illustrate, mostly secondary or high secondary academy have more than five subjects which students find hard to memorise . The second reason is the way teachers teach them. Many offspring cannot understand what tutors teach them and find their way of teaching boring. Lastly, there are fewer enjoyable activities in academy. For example, most faculty don’t have subjects like art and drawing. That is why children cannot focus on study.

To solve this problem parents and institutes need to come forward and take some steps. For instance, department need to arrange a parent meeting every month and parents also pay close attention to their children. Moreover, university can add some new subjects such as arts and crafts so children can relax in class. For example, if department add art classes so students enjoy them and it also refreshes their minds. These are the solutions to the issue.

In conclusion, because of the subject load and less mind fresh activities children cannot focus on their classes and studies. To solve it parents and institutes need to pay close attention to pupils and they also need to include some enjoyable activities such as arts and drawing in their syllabus.",3,5.0

First of all, developing your professional skills and your knowledge can be helpful to build a career. Nowadays, employees respect high education diplomas and look for your curriculum vitae(CV).

The result is that the latter will be chosen. Therefore, studying at university can play a big role in your life.

On the other hand, not only have college or university education received a prosperous occupation, but also there are a lot of successful and rich people who have alabeloned it. The good illustration is that of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, founders of ""Microsoft"" and ""Apple"" respectively. They are the richest people in the modern world. According to their experience, we can conclude that not always success comes from a good education. If you work hard on your dream, a hobby can transform into a way of earning money.

In conclusion, I would like to say that not in all situations education can provide you a prosperous future. If you work and develop yourself constantly, you will achieve your goals. Getting a high education diploma or working straight after graduation from school, is a dissection that every person claims due to his or her wishes.",5,6.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Those who have the desire to possess a house tend to do some research about the history of the new house before purchasing it. There are several reasons why they are doing this activity, and this essay will explain which approaches they can use.

There are several reasons why doing some research is popular among people. Firstly, the new residents want to ensure that they will get good facilities and a suitable environment. In other words, with high-quality facilities and a safe place, they might live in prosperity without distraction or feeling under threat with crimes. In addition, house finders have some purposes related to their work. Take a hectic worker, for example, they tend to choose to live in a place that is closed to their workplace. This is due to the fact that they do not consume their time to commute and it would reduce their expenses.

In terms of ways that dwellers can use to decide what kind of a new house fit for them associated with the advent of technology and making a communication. Through the internet, a person can access several platforms which offer a lively home. For instance, they can easily find several comments and a level of satisfaction in the residential areas. Furthermore, making communication with the local society would be an important aspect for house hunters. From this activity, they can acquire information through some conversation, such as, they would know how folk over there interact and socialize with each other. 

In conclusion, searching the history of the new home is an essential part of people's making-decision connected with the reasons of the conveniences and financial purposes. By doing this, the use of the internet and interaction with the local society is needed to find which building is suitable for them.",11,9.0
Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree to this statement?,"Holidays are deemed  necessary for the employee to rest so they can perform better. The length of days off may vary, but many believe that company should give their workers a minimum of a month per year. I believe that this is important to prevent burnout and improve overall health so they can do their assigned task well.

To begin with, holidays are vital for everyone, including workers. The company should allow their workers to leave the office for up to months per year to prevent burnout. Burnout which commonly occurs in workers, especially in a high-pressure environment, may predispose to bad decision-making and a decline in work performance. Moreover, staff may opt to leave the company that treats them badly by forcing them to work without sufficient days off. For instance, many young workers are resigned from their job in a startup company due to stress in the high-pressure environment. Hence, it is important for  business owners to give their employers several days off to take a good rest and maintain their mental well-being so they can perform well in their jobs.

Secondly, vacations are necessary to maintain the staff's general health. Overworked and tired workers may lead to a decline in work performance and decision-making. Proper sleep and rest are vital in maintaining good health to perform daily tasks. For example, a tired doctor on 24 hours shift may make mistakes in assessing and treating their patients that may lead to malpractice. Therefore, it is important for a company to allow their staff to take time off the office so they can rest peacefully and fully recharge their stamina in order to perform their responsibilities.

In conclusion,  business owners should give their workers sufficient time for a vacation to maintain the employee's mental and physical health as it is vital for people to do their job well.",5,6.0
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both view and give your opinion?","To commence with, the most important effect of economic flourish is deforestation. Many enormous international or local factories and companies are demanding large hectares of land for their various sort of developments such as building a new construction site of the new products. This has only one solution and that is sacrificing jungles and farms for the term which is called economic growth. 

Additionally, the economy expands and power growth is parallel with each other. In other words, the authorities who are in charge of applying these economical changes with the endless power have been given to them. A recent study illustrates that half of the local farming land in India has been taken by company owners. That same study also linked the percentage of poverty caused by this action which was more than 40 %.

Flip side of the coin, some say economic growth could magically vanish poverty. Economic developments tend to be a major factor of increasing local citizens' revenue by creating new ways of earning money for them. Take Maldives as an instance, the country which flourished with tourism economy growth. As mass tourism helped the locals to lessen society poverty by renting their homes to tourists. Besides, economical advancement may open the international markets for the countries which perhaps could make a significant change in the poverty rate of the citizens by trading different goods with other nations and getting the huge profit of them directly. For example, many Iranian citizens sell hand-made Termeh in international markets with a considerable amount of profit margin.

To conclude, there is a debate about poverty. Some opinions claim that poverty may harm our environment by developing the economy and some think this notion does not have any negative side and contains various benefits for vanishing the poverty without harming our habitat.",4,5.5
More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In contemporary society, there is a dramatic increase in the number of people who are overweight  this has caused a number of problems in the city such as fattening food to have low-price, and this can be afforded everywhere. Therefore, some people believe that the growing price of fattening meats can solve this trouble. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

To begin with, advocates of this proposition think that the best way to fix this matter is to raise the price of this diet. It is clear that fattening meats are the main factor in a rise in weight. In other words, eating meals which have a lot of fat can bring about a big size of the body, and disorder their health. As a result, the government also launched the policy so that buying is too difficult. For example, if people see that a cost increases, they may not  buy due to being unworthy.

On the other hand, apart from the adjustment of the value, there are several solutions which can solve this issue such as reducing the number of high-fat dishes in some restaurants or supermarkets. For instance, if they have dinner in a restaurant but this place does not have junk food like pizza, it will force them to choose other meals. Moreover, encouragement to activities such as playing sports and exercise in order to decrease their heaviness and have  good health.

In conclusion, although some suggest that plus the cost is the approach to diminishing this trouble, in my view, there are many ways to solve this issue.",6,6.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To What extent do you agree or disagree?","The public figures act as role models for teenagers and `influence their life in several ways. The youth get mesmerised by the popularity and wealth of cabrerites. I withstand the idea that some of the famous people indulge in flaunting their possessions and looks to gain publicity however there are some people who use their fame to inspire youth.

To begin with, there are influential figures whose actions or representations can adversely impact today’s new generation because the teenagers follow them blindly. These people convey the message of being rich and beautiful is the ultimate success of growth. For instance, the entertainment industry put a lot of emphasis on good looks which promote body shaming in society. Many youngsters follow diet plans to attain ideal body shape which resulted in eating disorders and low self-esteem.

On the contrary, there are people who show the right path to teens by setting an example of hard work, persistence and intelligence for coming generations. These kinds of people have high values in their personal domains which reflects in their work too. To illustrate, the Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar is a determined, hardworking and disciplined person who mostly do make movies on social subjects such as woman’s rights to access better sanitation; third gender rights to reduce the impacts of social stigmas.

To sum up, in my opinion, celebrities can influence teens in both ways positively as well as negatively. It is the moral responsibility of influencers to utilise their power to give the right direction to their followers and try to make difference in others life.",7,7.0
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it a waste of time.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion","There is no doubt that art education can play a vital role in the overall development of a child. Although some believe that including art in their curriculum is not worth their time. I would argue that it is a necessary subject that enhances the learning experience.
On the one hand, those who believe(think) studying(learning) art is time-consuming and worthless might argue that it does not lead to a successful career. This is because many artists struggle to make a living. For instance, a painter may find it troublesome selling a single piece of his art. In contrast, if the same time is utilized for learning other more important subjects at school, it will likely result in a fruitful profession such as medicine, engineering, law or architecture.
 
On the other hand, my view is that it is imperative to teach art at this stage because it imparts(communicate) different life skills. The reason for this is that by practicing arts children can develop skills like patience, improved motor ability, eye-hand coordination, creative thoughts and many more. Hence, if these skills are not taught at school, it may hinder the overall development of children.
In conclusion, while it is true that teaching art at school may seem to be a worthless and time-consuming pursuit, it is my firm belief that the time spent on it will foster life skills crucial for success in the future.",4,5.5
"Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. 


Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","The idea of providing distance education by numerous universities has become quite fashionable. Whilst I believe online courses have great benefits in severed cases, I presume that this trend may give rise to some downsides.

On the one hand, it is my belief that this tendency is likely to be profitable. One noticeable advantage is an increase in academic chances for social members. The adoption of video-conferencing technologies and free-to-use group chats in Internet-based courses may sever to facilitate the study of busy workers without leaving their current jobs. Furthermore, students can get access to academic lectures by prominent professors from world-famous universities via e-learning classes. Another point in favour is convenience. Online distance education enables students to not only take the initiative to plan their study schedule, but also review lectures, discussions, comments or share notes with each other on demand.

On the other hand, there appears to be potential shortcomings stemming from this trend. One disadvantage is the lack of interaction with the instructor and fellow classmates in the light of the internet disconnect. This procrastination may discourage learners from meeting their deadlines and completing their assignments. Students’ plagiarism and dishonesty are areas of concern as well. Some critics feel that it is easier to plagiarize or share answers owing to reduced surveillance and increased connectivity. Consequently, this copyright infringement could drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study.

Overall, based on what has been discussed above, it seems to me that learning activities through the medium of the internet has both the desired and adverse effects.",6,6.5
"Some people believe that the government 
Should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reason for your answer and include examples from your own experience","Some people believe that the government should finance civil onset like retirement pensions for adults instead of spending its budget on public services like agent needs while others say individuals should save their funds during their working period. This essay will delve into the upcoming paragraph and subsequently will explore perspective in turns.

On the one hand, I believe the government should definitely allocate a large part of its budget to public work. The economic sector determines the overall quality of life, ensuring basic sectors such as schools, hospitals and roads are available to all the citizens irrespective of their income and social status. The population needs  civil work. thus proper funds are needed

For example, the absence of medicine in any country will create significant problems. That's why the ministry should adequately finance  public services in the first place. Becoming old is a normal thing for everyone however younger population participate an important role in the country's economic growth.

On the other hand, retired adults are a vital part of  every family. Who encourage their close  as well as provides their experiences. I think adults must save their funds during their working times. However old people are also an integral side of the nation. Some ancient can save their money but most of the old population could not save money because of the high expenses. I think the state should provide free medicines and treatments for low-income citizens.

For instance,  Sri Lanka provides pensions for old citizens.

In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic,  I believe the ministry should allocate a large amount of its budget for argent needs.

However old society is also a crucial part of  society. I think the authority should implement a long-term concept for this issue. thus if not it becomes a huge impact on their life.",7,7.0
"In Some Countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.


What are the reasons for this?




How can people research this?","People nowadays who live on rent are more interested on finding out about the history of the houses or the buildings they live in. It has become a trend for some people where some finds out about that in sincere curiuosity.

There can be multiple reasons. Starting with certain countries like eastern cultural people beleive in Jinx and various other factors when they purchase or start a new thing in their life. Also it can be due to safety mesurement to ensure the strength of the building or how friendly the neighbourhood has been,

However, to research on this matter there are variuos different ways. If its a modern built house or building most details will be available online but also its no suprise if you even find a 15th Century building daetails on online as interenet has become smarter and smarter 

on a summary my personal view is that it is a good thing to research about the history and well being of the building which you are going to live by but it shouldnt be a case to put much weigh as certain things in life cannot be changed no matter how hard we try as there are things in life which is in no control with us.",0,<4
Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages.,"There is a common belief that nowadays  teenagers have to face up to the accepted and validated by their friends or peers.In my perspective, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. 

On the one hand,a notable upside is that peer pressure may motivate young people into discovering new interests that they may not have considered otherwise.This means,if they have pressure by their fellow millennials they will try their best day by day.To illustrate, after seeing photos of their peers at the gym, an adolescent might feel encouraged to take part in similar physical exercises, which is helpful for their physical health in turn.Besides young people usually take others, especially with whom they have close intimacy, as role models. Therefore, if peers can set a good example for their counterparts, they will probably achieve improvement in both academic and social aspects.When teenagers look at their friends get successful they will have an effort to keep up with them.

On the other hand,the negative should not be overshadowed by the positive. It is worth mentioning that the stress originating from a comparison among children would make them feel inferior to others, which leads to the fear of expressing themselves as well as potential self-distancing from family and friends. This can be an alarming issue as the worst consequence that may follow is suicide.

In conclusion,although peer pressure can prove conceived by supporting motivation, it is extremely tiny when compared to its multitude of drawbacks.",2,4.5
Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve the environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles.,"With the boost development of the world, the growing greenhouse gas emission has led to the environmental problems become tricky. Several people believe that increasing the cost for fuels cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to settle the environmental problems.However, I absolutely disagree on this view.

To begin with, there are many kinds of the environmental problems and fuels is unlikely the most serious pollution sources of environmental problems. There are also amounts of pollution, such as noise pollution,light pollution and three waste pollution which includes waste gas pollution, waste water pollution and waste residue pollution caused by urbanization and agriculture. Although increasing costs can release the adverse impact from fuels which used by cars and vehicles in a short term, there still has anther way to avoid environmental problems. 

Furthermore, the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles is a heavy burden which could not be estimated precisely. The more extend be polluted , the more capital is supposed to be invested. Even several developed countries could afford the expenditure, there are a large number of developing countries’ citizens who are suffering from the lack of primary needs, like hunger or disease.

In general, I strongly believe that increasing the cost turns to new energy resources could be better than the cost of fuels for cars or other vehicles to solve the environmental problems. Fuels will be used up ultimately as the non-renewable resource. And there has a thrive tendency that the market is turning to electric cars rather than the traditional oil-fueled automotive, which is eco-friendly does not produce the greenhouse gases.",5,6.0
Some people think that charity organizations should only offer help to people in their own country. But others believe that these organizations should give aid to people in great need wherever they live. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Helping the poor by the humanitarian groups is a matter of debate these days. A part of society believes that charity should only be associated within the nation while others argue, and assert that it should be for everyone in need across the globe. In my opinion, NGOs should assist each and everyone in their hard times regardless of their country.

The individuals who are in favour of the former view have various reasons for their assertion. The preponderant is, charitable trusts rely on the funds and benevolence, which generally provided by local citizens; thus, they have the first right on these services as they are keen to see revolutions of problems occurring in their society. Owing to this, giving services to another nation could antagonize fundraisers. Apart from this, It is pointless to serving others when people in own area is facing many difficulties. In short, Donors should prioritize their own country to curb social issues.

Conversely, there are opponents ,including me, argue that humanity has no boundaries. A person in need might be helped by the charity without asking his living place. The major argument in support of my viewpoint is, It would always better to help someone,who has not any way of living , instead of the one could survive by laborious jobs. Another major concern is natural disasters as they are perilous and man is helpless in such situations; thus, people residing in developed areas should assist the victims of these disasters. Many organization are working on humanity basics, such as Khalsa  aid- A UK based trust, they provide essentials and medical services in the disaster prone regions, no matters in which country it happened. All in all, all human belong to one earth; thus, donation corporations should do their jobs without partiality.

In conclusion, after delving into both type of arguments,

 I opine that charity should be regardless of nations. It seems to be unreasonable to assist in own region only.",2,4.5

Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Since the origin of mankind, we have been a part of mother nature. But, not like the other species on the planet, humans are interrupting its natural flow and changing nature as per their requirements. These activities have made an impact on the original balance of nature and climate changes are the key output of it. While some nations working on challenging climate change, some believe that the most suitable option is to get used to coping up with it.

The institutions that fight against climate change have to invest a huge amount of money in experiments. This includes the infrastructure cost, solution cost and testing cost too. Also, it is hard to predict the changes in temperature in the next fifty or hundred years. So, whatever solutions we come up with at present, might not be viable in future. Thus, this has become a never-ending process now. People have started to worry about the future, instead of enjoying the present moment, which is another sad situation.

Meantime, all the other species have been gradually adapting to the changes in the climate. Even humans are also capable of doing it and that is what we have been doing throughout the generations. Hence in this content, other animals are a step ahead the humans. The genetic generations have to be evolved to withstand the challenges in the coming period. It will only happen if humans are exposed to the present hardships. Otherwise, the future community will be a prisoner of the controlled environment which is created by themselves and none of them will ever live freely in the open air like us.

The climate and nature have been changing since our origin on the planet and we are as a species, so lucky to exist even after thousands of years. That is because of adaptation and evolution. So, in my opinion, the better option is to live with climate change instead of stand against it.",6,6.5
People think that the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinions.,"As society is advancing by leaps and bounds, people attach great importance to the protection of the environment. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus can hardly be reached as to whether the government should raise the price of petrol for transportation to solve environmental problems. While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue that other measures would have a greater impact. 

Firstly, it is noteworthy that if the government has a sharp rise in petrol prices, people would limit the number of their cars and the length of their journeys in order to save an extra expense. For example, the government would have to upgrade and expand public transport provisions such as trains or buses, as inhabitants would still need to travel to work, to school or to travel to shopping or hospitals. Secondly, from the perspective of freight services, more items would have to be transported by rails rather than trucks. Therefore, this measure could cut down on emissions from vehicles such as private cars, motors or lorries; and help to reduce the greenhouse effect.

On the other hand, while the above-mentioned method might be useful, the authority should adopt transport policies which would be more effective in the long term. For instance, the government of London has introduced a new policy called the congestion policy, which allows all vehicles to visit the city centre by paying a congestion charge. They then use that money to subsidize the cost of fares for citizens and to invest in transport infrastructure. As a result, this policy would help to improve air quality. Another measure would be to provide free-bus and free-train, this could help to reduce pollution for private vehicles and to combat global warming. 

In conclusion, increasing the cost of fuel would be an environmentally-friendly transport measure to solve environmental problems, although, in the long term, other methods would be more effective.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the present age, most people have an opportunity to get a higher education. However, some of them choose not to, and after graduation, they start working at various places. In this essay, I will discuss both views and state my opinion.

To start with, in the last year of school every teenager is encouraged to apply to a university or college and get their degree. That is why a vast number of students choose to study there. They are convinced, that it is the best way to ensure a bright future for themselves because it is well known that employers are more willing to give you the position of employment if you have finished any sort of school of higher education. Your degree shows that you are a better expert in a certain field and can do some tasks, which most people can’t. In other words, studying at a university helps you develop some exceptional competencies, that not many people have.

However, not all young human beings share the same view. Some of them believe, that it is useless to spend a few years studying and learning how things work only in theory, which is what most schools of higher education are offering. Those people choose to enter the labour market and gain needed skills in a practical way, which is considered to be more beneficial amongst some people. They share a view that theoretical knowledge will not help you in the real world when you start working, and that practical experience is the key. That is why a fair share of students choose to start working straight after finishing school.

Overall, as humans, only we know what is best for us – spending those 3 or 4 years in a university or college or getting a job straight after school. I believe that both of these options can be beneficial for a young person, trying to find his own path, but I personally am in favour of the former view, and I think that it is better to learn some thin",8,7.5
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only governments actions can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that low-quality house construction in big cities can lead to negative outcomes related to people’s lives. I personally believe that authorities are the only organizations that can address this issue.

On the one hand,  high-quality accommodation requires a huge investment which most people can not afford, causing the lack of houses with good conditions resulting in a need for government support. In other words, besides housing, people have to spend their money on other essential services and food, contributing to a consideration for balance expenses. Consequently, individuals with limited budgets take a small amount of money to pay for low-quality housing regardless of risks related to safety. As a result, it is necessary for administrations to be in charge of raising house funds to lend to residents with low interest if they use the loans for good housing. Furthermore, governments can diversify levels of taxes, applying lower taxes for communities with low incomes, helping them to decrease tax burdens, contributing to consideration for better accommodations.

On the other hand, authorities need to enact stricter regulations for house construction processes. The lack of integrity in housing establishments from some organizations is observing an upward trend. It means that they decrease housing investment budgets for personal purposes causing lower amounts of money that can merely afford low-quality building materials, consequently attributed as a main reason for the shortage of housing. Hence, in order to address the aforementioned issue, authorities are the sole institutions which have sufficient power to control this bad situation by banning heavy fines for individuals who are working illegally.

In conclusion, the housing crisis caused by the deficiency of quality can be solved by no one except authorities as they can apply supporting methods and regulations to improve the occurrence",6,6.5
Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.,"In the last few years, the debate regarding museums has been raised. Some people believe that museums are a place where you gain knowledge and education. However, Some others claim that  historical places like museums should be attractive and enjoyable to the public. I believe that museums are  educational places but also they can be entertaining to attract more visitors. 

On one hand, a historical gallery is a place where the visitors explore the history of nations. In addition, they can learn about the tools as well as the methods that had been used in the ancient era. For instance, the Louvre museum exhibits  ancient Egyptian clothes and statues. As a consequence, such galleries should not accept any entertaining activities that will disrupt the tourists. 

On the other hand, recreational activities inside the museums will attract more community members to come and learn about our history. Furthermore, such activities will enhance the people experience as well as encouraging them to bring their children. For example, display a relevant adventure movie with high-quality sound, this movie may focus on some historical events in order to gain youth attention. Moreover, some ancient venues organize competitions to bring more participants as well as more media coverage. As a result, more revenue can be generated to support the employee's salaries  together with expansion projects.

In conclusion, museums are a great venue to gain knowledge regarding ancient events. Although it is an educational zone, we can include some enjoyable shows. Such activities will motivate more youth and children to visit museums. This can include movie shows and competitions.",8,7.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Every living organisms life are influenced by the weather system. Due to different types of pollutions, global warming and other factors the climate begins to change. A few peoples have the opinion that finding a living method according to the climate method is the better choice than that of controlling climatic changes.

Climate plays a significant role in the food products we consume daily to survive. Though we have a plethora of varaities of food across the world, every country will choose their own variety of food which suits their climatic condition. Frequent climate change will also impact the cultivation of crops. Mostly, farmers select the crops to be cultivated based on the seasons. For example, In India, the northern half remains to be cold and dry, so the farmers will cultivate wheat whereas, in southern half will have good rain and also it remains warm in few months of the year so the farmers in the south will choose rice. Even though we are in the technology developed world, there is no alternative found for food.

Not only humans but also other living organisms will also affect by this climatic change. Most of the animal breed based on the climate only as a consequence of climatic change the particular animal may move to the verge of extinction. Furthermore, It will also affect the trees and plants across the world. Factually, the average life span of trees are around 60 years and also they will grow based on the climate and soil types alone. If the climate started to change, there is a high probability of extinction of the trees. Trees are the major oxygen producer of the world, humans inhale oxygen to live. As a result, there is no possibility for the survival of the living organisms in the world.

In conclusion, by the above discussion, I strongly oppose the opinion of finding the method to live according to the climate change. If we chose there is less probability to get a high success rate. Because it requires the reconstruction of the whole world based on the climate changed which includes food, trees etc.",3,5.0
"some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligence robots.
what is your opinions?","Nowadays, the pace of replacing humans in the workforce by artificial intelligence is increasing constantly. In my opinion,it’s probable that unskilled jobs will eventually be done by robots, however,it’s unlikely that works that involve human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why the human presence for some jobs remains imperative.

All human labour that doesn’t require any specific or complex human skill would be eventually replaced by Robots. This simply because artificial intelligence is more effective and less expensive than human resources, that is why companies will be less interested in hiring. For example in ROMANIA more than 50% of Mature Automotive staffs have been replaced by an automated line that cost far less than employees, moreover,it works around the clock without asking for vacation or vacation pay. For these reasons, in the future robotic intelligence will substitute human in all menial jobs.

However, there are some fields where human is really indispensable and cannot be replaced. As artificially intelligence is limited it cannot achieve the capacity to do some tasks which require human touches such as psychology, education, medicine and social works. A Psychologist needs advanced human skills and a lot of experience to do as well as his job. For that robot as a machine can never adapt to the specificity of these jobs.

To conclude, it’s increasingly likely that robots will eventually succeed human in a great number of jobs. Physically efforts jobs that don’t require a high skill level will be entirely executed by machines; nevertheless, the sophisticated jobs that include specific talent and experience will always exist. Eventually,  very few jobs will be saved in the future in an increasingly artificially intelligence workforce.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your opinion?","The world has become very well-placed thanks to technology. Scientists have been creating many robots. Some individuals think that robots will do people’s jobs while others believe that they cannot do citizen’s occupations. From my point of view, they will more develop but they cannot do what people make all things. 

  To begin with, artificial intelligence has been developing in the world. They can cook, they can fight but they cannot think like the community. For example, human is the only living thing on the planet that can think. Scientists give them software and then they move according to this program. If their program is down, they cannot do anything. Therefore, eventually, all jobs will not be artificially smart automation.

  Furthermore, automation has a determinate time. They have a charge and they cannot do what they want at any time. For instance, a war robot can run out of battery at the most critical moment of battle or doctor automation break down in the surgery. Everything is possible. However, an individual is not like them. if he didn’t die in the battle, he can battle or if he is not sleepy, he can operate. That is why cyborgs can't replace humans.

  To sum up, there are more cyborgs produced than in the past and more advanced now. They make more thinks than past. In my opinion, they need more time to do community’s occupations as we do not have enough technology for this but I strongly believe they will not ever do citizen’s jobs.",9,8.0
Some people believe that time spent on electronic games can be valuable for children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the highly developed technological word, game industry has been growing dramatically, especially electronic games such as TV, video and computer games. While it is claimed by some people that these game bring children with certain benefits, others believe that gaming may be detrimental to them. The following essay analyzes both views and I firmly support for the idea that electronic games influence negatively on young generation.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why it might be argued that electronic games have specific merits. The most widely acknowledged positive impact is that playing games promotes children’s cognitive skills regarding concentration, imagination and sympathy. A case in point is that when the young approach to such a game that is kind of helping others, they tend to show more empathy in their daily lives. In addition to that, electronic games are significantly beneficial for players’ mental health. To illustrate, games can entertain players and help them recharge their battery after school. Therefore, to some extent, it is worth for children spending time on electronic games.
Despite the above arguments, I contend that electronic games have a detrimental impact on young generation. Firstly, the most concerning problem that these ones may adversely affect children’s physical health. That children glue their eyes in front of the screen playing game can pose the risk of obesity, heart attack and a certain form of cancers. Moreover, exposure to high video game violence is likely to have effect on behavior in children. As a result, they have a tendency to get aggressive manner whenever facing with a problem in real life. For instance, when they get into trouble with friends, they resort to violence to deal with their problem easily. 
In conclusion, while it is argued that electronic games bring their own merits, I still concur that they do harm the young and suppose that time spent on games should be controlled strictly.",5,6.0
"If a product is good or it meets people's needs, people will buy it. So advertising is unnecessary and no more than entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?","In the modern world, masses purchase only those things which are of great quality and meet their requirements. Therefore, individuals believe that adverts are no longer needed, and these are just a source of entertainment. I completely disagree with the notion because advertisements help people to know about new products, and it influences them.
To commence with, if companies advertise their products, the customers can come to know about their newly launched items as they not only gain information about its features, but also tell them how to use it. So, this is the prominent reason why advertisements are needed. For example, Apple, known for its quality products in the mobile phone industry, has captured fifty percent market share in India after advertising its products in the Indian subcontinent because this brand provides accurate information in its promotional. Hence, advertisement plays a pivotal role to increase customer awareness and selling new products for organizations.
Moreover, commercials also support the institutions to influence the consumers to purchase goods because there is a huge competition in the market among the competitors, and a number of high-quality products are available for sale. Thus to boost the sales, adverts are essential. For instance, in India, there are two big brands, namely Bajaj and Hero Honda, which manufacture motorbikes as end products of these brands are equally efficient, and they promote them to convince the people to buy their products. Thereby, it is apparent that advertising is vital in selling things.
To summarize, advertisements are significant, even if the product quality is superior. In my opinion, it tells masses about new launches as well as helps them to choose the right brand.",7,7.0
Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help prevent illness and diseas. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Man-made pollution has became a challenging problem over last century, that is increasing with significant speed over the world. Moreover, rapid population growth and subsequent lack of their accommodations have acompanied it to increase the prevalence of ailments. It is argued that the government as the most responsible authority of a country should locate solving these two problems above all to impede diseases' distribution. I am completely in agreement with the above-said idea. This essay will overlook two reasons that support my notion.

Firstly, the role that pollution plays as a risk factor for diseases is blatant. For example, waste that factories have released into the oceans has been contaminating many types of marine habitants, that not only is affecting those creatures but also is posioning humans who are consuming them. Consequently, taking measures to solve pollution will preserve the nature and the countries' settlers, which is the main goal for governments.

Secondly, Distribution of contiguous diseases is more probable to happen in crowded areas. For instance, statistics of dead cases due to Covid-19 were higher in cities with higher population concentration during the pandemic, especially in those places where the prevalence of people living on streets were high, like Mombie. Thus, the spread of some diseases will decrease with better housing facilities and will result in the better public health, which is the priority of each government.

To sum up, the government might be able to overcome many illnesses by emphesizing on the pollution reduction and providing housing facilities. I believe that  pollution is one of risk factors of many medical conditions and poor living situations can exacerbate spread of the others, so by concentrating on these two matters, governments keep their people safe.",5,6.0
Many universities graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. what factors may have caused this situation and what in your opinion should be done about it?,"As the world keeps moving, making adapations and innovation which encourages artificial intelligence working instance of humans's duties. Some people believe that the main factors are humans do not have enough experience and creativities while other oppose that companies saving cost by using artificial intelligence. This essay will examine why the new generation teenager cannot provide job and my prespective will be discussed. 

If the world is a big competition, experience is an essential role for runner to approach the goal. From my point of view, the initial reason why new students do not have opputunity to apply is that their do not have experience. For instance, most employee need employer who have a working background. To illstrate, one of the way to receive the job is to gain experience which organizations do not have to waste the money of training and another sources.  

The another reason is that after the covid-19 pandamic has been spreading extremly fash which let various factories use an artificial intelligence which their do not prefer fresh graduated pupils. Futhermore, this is cheaper than the human resource.  To explain, if they is no food, they is no life. Food provides energy for human to do acticities in dairy life while it will not happen with the smart devices. This means that it will save the budget and time at the same time. 

To sum up, in my opinion, why companies do not allow the graduted students to apply is that after covid-19 they have new way to save cost which they do not have spend on the new employees anymore. Lastly, the company tries to save cost by provides oppunities for people who have an experience.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after shcool. Discuss both views.","What you gonna do after  high school is an important decision inactivity. Most students would go to a prep faculty because they have  confidence in it is the most appropriate measure to success in growth. However, others believe getting straight to a career, learning in practice and gaining some experience is a more accurate move to advancement. This essay will discuss both views.

On the one hand, studying at an educational institution  will give you 

that security you have a knowledge of the position of employment and the certificate will prove you know how to do the situation. It becomes clear over  time that employers will choose people who are well-educated individuals rather than other less-educated people for high positions. For example, 86% of the students who pass the prep institute got an assignment after  graduation. It entails going to an educational institution is an accurate approach to advancing in one's career.

On the other hand, not everyone thinks of this action . Some individuals assume the academy is the waste of time and not necessary to go to. And will say attending an educational institution and spending 4 years on learning along with reading unnecessary loads of books that you might forget or not even use  of them is a useless thing to do. Those who got a position right after school become more experienced and tend to achieve more in the heart. For example, there is a lot of case of people who were working and reached more along with gaining valuable lesson, while others still learning at the academy.

In conclusion, the educational association is an accurate and understandable use to reach more in the heart. But being gainfully employed  can give you an important lesson that leads to success.",6,6.5
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages.","The question about the perfect time to have children is debatable. In recent times, the trend of having children has increased significantly. This essay will discuss both the positive and negative outcomes of having children at older ages, while also explaining why the advantages tend to outweigh any perceived downsides .

To begin with, one of the main benefits is stability and maturity. Many individuals often lack sufficient time for their children at a young age due to career commitments and an unstable income. After having a great career, they can easily afford the best and the stable life for their child. According to a recent survey at Cambridge University, in developed countries, 80% of respondents plan to have children after the age of 35 years old. Furthermore, more mature parents tend to possess financial stability and independence. This stability can create an environment where children's needs are consistently met, improving their overall upbringing.

On the other hand, it is essential to emphasize potential disadvantages. To commence with, complications during pregnancy can be increased by advanced maternal and paternal age, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and genetic disorders. In addition, older parents might have concerns about being able to provide for their children throughout their lives, especially if health issues arise later on.

 Also, the generation gap between older parents and their children might cause communication problems and difficulties in relating to each other’s experiences.

In conclusion, despite several downsides, this trend should be welcomed and encouraged. Older parents might have more time to spend with their children, but the quality of that time might be influenced by physical limitations or generational differences.",7,7.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is an ongoing debate among people concerning  climate change, and what we should or should not be doing about it. While the environmentalist advocate for the actions that may reverse the effects of  climate change, I strongly believe it is high time that we learn to live with it. 

There is a deluge of arguments in favour of my stand. Firstly,  climate change is a global phenomenon, and it has been taking place all across the globe throughout centuries. In other words, this is an on-going process; consequently, its changes can not be undone instantaneously.  As a result, we as a society should collectively invest our capabilities in developing the appropriate systems to combat any of the unforeseeable events that may happen in the future. For example, the Australian bushfires of 2019 have not only significantly destroyed the lives of the wildlife, but also considerably affected the livelihood of the communities in those areas. Therefore, the government and people should be ready with the right resources in case there are bushfires anywhere else in Australia.

On the other hand, climate change activists recommend that people should reduce the use of fuel vehicles to decrease  carbon emissions in the air.  This means that people should walk or use a bicycle in order to commute. However, according to the recent report by the Australian department of meteorology, the average days in summer are warmer by 2 degrees compared to a few decades ago. Thus, people tend to use their cars to travel in hot sunny days. 

In conclusion, having considered both the views, I am of the opinion that we have to live with the effects of climate change.",7,7.0
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time . This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well . To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the ultramodern epoch, it is a point of debate that the group of teen agers should help to poor people who have not money or things to live of life. Undoubtedly, this notion remains successful in keeping the majority in its favour. The upcoming paragraphs would cast light on my argument related to very conception.

I wholeheartedly concur with the statement that those people who belong from 13 to 18 should do something for community. These myriad reason in  favour of my argument, intelligent pupils should help to children those have not house for living and they are lived in footpath side of the road. They have not money for eat to food then how they start their study in school. Pupils should help to them in study for unpaid because if they will educate they can achieve some good jobs and this effect is also good impact on country economy.

To add a few more reason, how can one forget about? , there is some also have cons this. To justify the some, there is epitome of if juvenile doing unpaid work in community they will face some problem. They are also student and they have not lot of time. If they will go help for community they can loss of study. Apart from all this they will disappoint from the people who are also working for community. And they will see the people who cannot get job from the Government and in good company. Even they are well educated and have high degree from university. This is definitely bad impact on student. They will distract from their study.

On a final note, I am of the opinion there are different pros and cons about help to community as there is not any plausible argument against the very phenomenon.",1,4.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your opinion","There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over the personal idea contribution of people having a learning journey at high schools. While some claim that it is recommendable that potential students should show their views or even judge their lecturers, the opposite makes a statement that it can bring a negative effect on students’ respectful attitude and demolish classroom’s regulation. I would contend that it is comparatively essential for teachers to receive their student’s comments, yet it is only valid to some extent.

Without a shadow of a doubt, expressing students’ individual viewpoints is tremendously beneficial to teachers. Since it is obvious to realize that these actions from students who directly absorb a wide range of theoretical insights greatly helps their teacher acknowledge their strength and weakness in their teaching methods. For example, instead of imparting this amount of rocky theory by using textbooks, having a sympathetic ear from students’ wish to pass them down in some powerpoint, video or intriguing games is a more suitable tactic of teaching for professors in this technological development’s era, which make their high school students kindle more interests in their digesting knowledge. Hence, learners’ conception plays a relatively vital role towards their educators so as to enhance the quality of education.

While the redeeming features of conveying opinions of students are widely acknowledged, they need to show their comments with appropriate behavior in order not to overcome the boundary of disrespect . Apparently, an appropriate attitude is put into the priority rather than other elements, which is the reason why negative contributions of immoral learners demonstrate an unthankfulness towards their imparter on whom bring enormous disadvantageous influences. For instance, in this day and age, there are a wealth of  harmful comments of students who are not grateful for their teachers on some social media, namely Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which become one of the alarming cyber violent problems affecting the spirit and reputation of their lecturers. Thus, these actions without thinking is also the obstacle of the high respect for teachers. 

In conclusion, even though making some individual contributions from students is of essence, a student’s disrespect etiquette with their teachers will be expressed clearly if it goes beyond the limit.",3,5.0

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others think that it is better to get a job straight after school. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, the use of technology is spread over the globe. Some claim that teachers will be completely replaced by technology in the future. I ultimately disagree with this view, as understanding students' feelings and interaction with them in the class are tasks that can not be achieved without teachers. This essay, therefore, will discuss these reasons in more details in the next paragraphs. 

Teachers, as human beings, are able to understand the feeling of students, while technology alone can not do this rule. This is because,  feelings are a complex process and technology is yet far from dealing with such a process. For instance, teachers are able to know if the pupils misunderstand a certain topic through their facial expressions. Without teachers, students will face many challenges in the classroom, while no one knows or understand that. Therefore, technology can not take the rule of teachers, due to a lack of understanding of students feelings.

Furthermore, without teachers in the ,classroom there is no interaction with students. Because, only humans have the ability to interact, while other technological tools do not. According to a recent research published by Freiburg university in 2019 : Scientists are unable to make interactive technology as humans can interact. Even though, with help of robotic teachers in the future, interaction skills are probably to be absent in the classes. Therefore, technology can not replace teachers interactions. 

In conclusion, even though, the spread of technology, I disagree with the ability   to completely take place of teachers in the classroom. As it can interfere with the feelings of students and interact with them as teachers do.",6,6.5
". Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children at a later age. What do you think   are the major reasons for this? Do advantages of this trend outweigh","In recent years, having children later has become a popular trend. There are several reasons for   this phenomenon, and I believe that it has obvious disadvantages for every family and our   community.  There are two main reasons why more and more young people are refusing to have children when   they are in the early stages of their careers. Firstly, instead of becoming parents at an early age,   modern women are more likely to get higher education and want to move up the career ladder. If   they get married and have a baby, it will be difficult for working mothers to divide their time to   devote themselves to work and care for their offspring. Secondly, young childless families may   have a strong sense of self-satisfaction. This leads to the fact that they prefer to enjoy life rather   than raising children. For example, modern women tend to take care of their body and   communicate with friends more than raising a child.  However, the postponement of childbirth is no longer a private affair of each family, but also   greatly affects the survival of the whole nation. This trend negatively affects older parents and their   future children when wives decide to get pregnant. In fact, after age 35, older mothers may face   the risk of miscarriage or difficult childbirth. Moreover, if mothers have easy deliveries, babies are   at risk of developing Down syndrome. As a result, it could negatively impact those who shape the   nation's tomorrow and the quality of our future productive workforce.  To sum up, there are several reasons why many people tend to put off having a baby in their lives.   Therefore, it can negatively affect every family",4,5.5

Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With the rising globalization and industrialization, the climate in the world is changing drastically and living beings are facing numerous threats. However, majority of the people hold the view that we should get adapted to climate change instead of finding solutions to stop it. I completely disagree with the aforementioned view and the following essay will elaborate further with examples. 

Commencing, with the developing world people have created drastic changes to climate change and today people ate trying to live with it without finding solutions. When the world tries to develop overnight governments destroy natural lands to build buildings and fill oceans, and lakes will excess garbage which is emitted by factories. Hence, different sectors of society have to face challenges such as droughts that can harm food production and human health, and flooding that can spread and damage infrastructure. As an example, in Sri Lanka majority of the rural areas are destroyed by cutting down trees and filling up massive reservoirs with soil which ultimately leads to heavy droughts. However, people try to live with serious issues by neglecting them. 

On the other hand, human health is a controversial issue that people have to face today due to climate change. Changes in weather and patterns have put lives at risk where the majority of people are subjected to heat phenomena. As an example, today a plethora of children in middle eastern countries die due to heavy heat conditions where there is no food or water to drink. Besides, dry weather conditions lead to wildfires and bushfires which bring many health risks. 

In conclusion, I believe that as a society people should start preventing climate change thus if this condition continues in the future it's we who have to face the most vulnerable risks.",9,8.0
"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is an opinion that the costs of fuels should be risen to create a solution to global environmental issues. Given this observation, in my contention, this viewpoint is correct in that as much as this situation forces industrial factories to seek new resources for energy, and should the price is not increased, individual car usage cannot be reduced.

What strikes one first about environmental issues is its relationship with the industries which highly consume fuels for production. In fact, because of the absence of compulsory factors like the price, companies do not research a new harmless fuel. Notably, in the farm sector, the fossil fuel expenditures being considerably low, nobody prefers to use renewable energy resources. To illustrate this point, the UK’s farmers do not want to build new solar panel systems, because building costs way more than fuels. Therefore, prices must skyrocket in order to clear the way for the consumption of environmentally beneficial fuels.

Yet another reason why prices should be increased is the number of vehicles, which consume 65% of the fossil fuel all around the world. No one would dispute that drivers can be deterred from these cars thanks to increased costs only. Not only can it force people into a new type of vehicle, but it also can alleviate emitting harmful gases. It is exemplified by TESLA, which is a new electrical car brand, their board members claim that the cars reduce carbon emissions by 55 per cent. Thus, having highly expensive prices for fuels can disappear the percentage of emissions.

In conclusion, increasing fuel costs has sparked much debate among some. I concur with the idea that the rate of cars in traffic and industrial companies are responsible for the environmental problem, hence, prices must be risen for deterring them.",6,6.5
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Concentration difficulties or not paying enough attention to lessons has been one of the big issues facing children, parents, and teachers for years, draining a lot of time, resources, and putting heavy burdens on all partys envolved in the process, through this essay I'll be discussing this problem causes and possible soultions.

   From my prespective, there are number of reasons leading to pupils' loss of concentration during classes. the first cause would be domestic troubles, minors are very sensitive to instabilities, divorces, any of the parents absence, violence, financial problems, under nutrition, malnutrition, or unstable daily schedule resulting in lack of suitable sleeping hours, study time, and enough period to play and have fun so Juniors can release their energy.

  The other factors are schoold related, starting with schooling system which doesn't consider what type of sciences the kids are attracted too, some loves art, the others prefers biology, and others are fond with history, also the educational techniques and materials that in many cases are boring and forces any one to fall a sleep.

Finally, the most proper way to end such dilemma is by eradicating the roots of this problems, Homes shall provide safe haven to the young and schools has to be appealing and pay attention to how the service is provided and how to yield what is fruitful.",0,<4
Newspapers have influenced people's ideas and opinions. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation? the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation?,"People are  impacted a lot by media including newspapers in terms of how they view and perceive the situations they read. I will discuss the reasons for this and why I believe it is rather a neutral situation. 

To begin with, the public tends to depend on the information they received and trust it undoubtedly. The newspaper does not only contain the real content of the circumstances like name, age or the place of the incident but also how it feels about the occurrence. For example, the  editor might put his personal emotion or notion or even hidden words behind the story. Thus, those individuals reading the news could easily have common feelings with the writer and  conformed to those ideas. Moreover, the more they consume the information, the more they trust the sources and views of the information. The social will get used to receiving  information from the same sources and are likely to have the exact feelings and opinions. For instance, if you support the current Thai prime minister, you will always get the news praising him for doing his best for the country and is against the pro-democracy group. 

I personally view this as a neutral situation as it truly depends on the sources and origin of the news. If they are proof-checking the data and do not try to persuade or mislead the readers or viewers that is rather a positive situation. However, there are publishers or writers who might be supported by some political groups, therefore they might overly support that particular party and hugely affect the viewers' stances. This could be a negative situation. 

In conclusion, the effects of the newspaper are entirely based on the contents  and the perceptions shown. If it is misleading or way too persuasive, I view it negatively. However, when it provides truth, it is rather a positive incident.",10,8.5

with that sounding strongly controversial, with no middle grounds to meet, I might as well take a side. no. I don't think this sounds logical.
throwing your parental responisbilities on outside factors such as 'government' or 'a universal conspiracy' is merely being paranoid. the government does not benefit from creating obese children, nor do they have the leisure time for such idiotic problems. point such allegations on business companies, it sounds more believable.
whenever obesity is mentioned, my mind jumps into the bigger picture of children given allowances, of which they barely save from and continuously spend on unhealthy food. that, my dear, is the reason for obesity. lack of observation, lack of strict rules, lack of awareness. as a mother, it is important to monitor your children's diet and health. it is equally important to give them a good space to play sports in, which would greatly decrease obesity rate. assuming that the government has a hand in such trivial matters, they won't control you from looking after your children properly. that, as well as a point metioned previously: what do they benefit? spending money and effort and time on, lets say, sponsors to attract children to candy, funding children sweets, and sponsoring for attractive street food to engrave the constant need for those in a child's mind. the question is, what do they gain in return? it is foolish to fund that that doesn't give back equal benefit
so let's state it again, only a foolish government is responsible for the rise of obesity in children",4,5.5

In my opinion , I believe that the advantages of this development can outweigh its disadvantages.

On the one hand, it is argued by some persons that robots can be a negative trend and may  engender some problems . The major reason is that the unemployment rate has increased when companies start to use robots rather than workers because one robot can replace , for ,example ten of persons and then engines remain more cheaply than humans , that is why managers prefer having robots instead of real people . In addition , the excessive use of  those tools can make people lazier and practice less  physical activities , as a result , they have more chances to get some diseases , such as obesity, which remains a negative issue among communities and affects negatively its advancement .

On the other hand,  machines play a pivotal role in the advancement of manufacturing and making easy and convenient the lifestyle of citizens . Firstly, the industries have shown a positive evolution thanks to robots which have improved  productivity and  efficiency. For example ,the swing robot has changed the way in which the clothes are made because it increases the number of products and minimizes the probability of errors . Secondly , the lifestyle of individuals become more convenient and comfortable thanks to the house robots , such as robot vacuum cleaners  which helps people to clean the house fastly and efficiently . As a result , citizens become less busy with the household and save their time which can be invested in working and studying , which can be useful for the development of the country .

In conclusion , Although those machines have some obvious adverse effects on communities , I believe that it is a positive tendency and can help manufacturers to improve their businesses and make the life of citizens more comfortable and convenient .",8,7.5
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many people deem that the corporations not only just cheasing money, they are obliged to the populace and ought to make contributions for the society.

"Some people think that it is a good idea to give children a small amount of money each week to spend on what they would like. Other people think that this is wrong and that it is a waste of money.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Few people believe that children should be given some money as a weekly allowance to spend as they wish, and others prefer not to do it, thinking that it is not fruitful.

When we hand over money to children, we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life, which will be very helpful for them as they grow old. For instance, my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week to her child. I remember, there was a time when she wanted an expensive toy, and had to save her pocket money for 1 year in order to get it. This way not only she learnt about savings, but she also understood, which items are worth spending on.

However, providing money to children can sometimes be the cause of major problems, as the parents have no control over how the child will use it. For example, one of my friend’s son used the money he received to impress others in his school, and spent it on the items he can show-off, like the latest toy or buying expensive dessert. This increased peer pressure on the poor students of his class who started demanding money from their parents as well. This is not a favourable situation for the poor family as they barely have the money to raise their kids.

In conclusion, my opinion is that money should not be handed to children to make expenses on their own. Rather, it is a better idea to keep their spendings under adult supervision, so that we can guide them about the positives and negatives of their spendings. I do not think it is a wise decision to give weekly allowance to kids.",8,7.5

To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it in another way, the management should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses. Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the matter of even distribution of homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore, are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes on bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example, the Canadian ministry restricts the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the problem of the housing shortage. 

On a contrary, people could also solve this problem by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer living in the suburbs and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. The community can find more job opportunities like farming in villages to earn their livelihood. This would help in bringing more employment to the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages. The fresh air of villages would also make people more healthy and less stressed. Therefore, it would reduce crimes in society. 

To conclude, although people move to metropolitan cities in search of better opportunities, they still face residential issues. Therefore, it is the responsibility of both the law and the community to resolve the issue by encouraging people to live in vertical housing and villages.",5,6.0
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","It is argued that there has been a rise in count of parents who educate their young ones themselves at home instead of educating them in colleges. This essay argues that disadvantages of this outweigh the advantages because of the serious issues it can cause. This essay firstly discuss  lack of exposure, lack of updates as the disadvantages and then brings saving money as the one of the advantage.

Firstly, if youngsters are trained by their parents then children may lack face to face interaction with others. This is because school is a place where one can interact with different kind of children and staff members so the child may not feel difficulty in starting a conversation with a stranger. Moreover, it gives the opportunity to create good friends. Further, the teachers in a school are highly trained. They keep themselves updated with subject knowledge and they know in what way to teach so that the student can easily understand. This is not the same in case of parents who educate their children. Even the child may get bored by a continuous long teaching from his elderly ones. 

Now a day's fee in school has become a serious problem. Many parents cannot afford  the high tuition fee demanded by the school. If parents had the enough subject knowledge and potential to develop their kids then this can save a lot of money. This saved money can be used for further purposes. Some of the parents are teachers and they have the ability to uplift their heir.  To illustrate this further, a man named 'Rahul' who was disabled had got admitted in the most reputed institution IIT MUMBAI by pursuing training from his parents who cannot afford for his primary education and training, whereas the students who spent a lot of money for getting trained in a standard institute have not gotten admission.

In conclusion, on the fact that without the peer to peer exposure it is difficult for any individual to survive so the disadvantages stand strong and clearly destroys the advantages. Even though there are some advantages but the disadvantages are innumerous and critical. Hence the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages.",5,6.0
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"In the contemporary society, it is true that advertisements play a pivotal part in our daily life. In my point of view, the growth of advertisements brings both benefits and drawbacks in equal measure to people and society as a whole.
On the one hand, advertisements might have negative impacts on people and society in numerous aspects. As for individuals, increasing advertising results in people live in a consumer culture where their choice of goods might be manipulated if they were over-reliant on commercials. Nowadays, since companies focus on selling their brand images, advertisers aim to persuade us that buying those goods will eventually lead to happiness, which might become the perfect for businesses or companies to exaggerate or even distort the products’ fact. For example, marketers often bombard consumers via media outlets or by giving goody bags with a view to catching people’s attention. Furthermore, children’s mind can be easily affected by advertisements, they insist on putting pressure on parents to buy them things especially toys. Besides, some commercials have inappropriate content which may be harmful to their mental development onwards.
On the other hand, regardless of those above-mentioned reasons, advertising is an astonishing form ofpromoting products that meets the need of customers and firms as well. Firstly, advertisements keep people always up-to-date about newly-launched products. Hence, consumers will have a greater arrayy of selections to decide which merchant is the best for them. By dint of the large-scale expansion of advertising in almost every kind of mass media and nearly all hoardings, this sector is likely to generate a diversity of employment opportunities. It will create more occupations to logo designers or copywriters to compose the ideas and contents for commercials.
To summarise, I strongly believe that both individuals and businesses gain significant benefits and drawbacks through the development of advertisements.",5,6.0
"Some people think that it is a good idea to give children a small amount of
money each week to spend on what they would like. Other people think that
this is wrong and that it is a waste of money.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Offering minor currency to children to spend on their own on a weekly basis is a common practice in any society across the globe. There has been opposing debate going on for a long time conflicting the moral aspect in both the cases. In my opinion, both views carry pros and cons equally, but offering money in little quantity along with proper parental guidance will do a great help to the financial knowledge of the young children. 

Primarily, offering tiny amounts of funds on a weekly basis with good adult monitoring would help the younger generation practically understand the transactions in the day-to-day activities. They learn how to segregate the little fund they have and accommodate major part of the most essential activities and spend the rest on the pleasure giving items like candy and ice cream. For instance, a recent survey done by the Times magazine has revealed that the youngsters who are given freedom to buy things on their own faced fewer financial management difficulties when they finally move out of their parents’ homes. Hence, providing the opportunity for children to spend small cash on their own would be a great idea. 

Secondarily, there is another view which contradicts the idea of offering currency to children. People with this view believe that children would become spoiled with free funds in their hands and develop a reckless attitude towards spending finances as they grow up. For example, a survey revealed that this point is valid considering the number of teenagers who didn’t learn the value of money due to the frequent perks they receive from their parents or guardians. In this regard, offering hand cash to the Children is considered a morally bad practice.

Exposure to finance, though how small it is, will shape up how a young person would turn up as an adult. Offering only perks in the form of cash will make Children take their benefits for granted and on the other hand providing nothing will make them financial illiterates. To summarize, the role of parents or guardians is emphasized here as it defines the character of the children while giving away free perks.",9,8.0
"In Some Countries, More And More People Are Becoming Interested In Finding Out About The History Of The House Or Building They Live In. What Are The Reasons For This? How Can People Research This?","It is undeniable that in certain countries occupants of houses are eager to scrutinize about the history of their houses or buildings they live in. The main reasons for this could be to identify any cultural significance and to check for any legal disputes on the property they occupy. Hence, there are a several ways to obtain such information. 

To begin with, people living n these properties research the past mainly to scrutinize on any legal issues pertaining to the building. In other words, if the house has any legal disputes or court cases in the past it would certainly cause problems for the current owners. For example, there are many instances where the previous owners have gained ownership through fraudulent acts. In such instances current occupants will also be dragged into disputes. Ultimately, all parties involved will be in trouble. 

Moreover, some houses are built with a strong cultural and significance influence which directly enhance their market value. To illustrate this further, certain old houses in Sri Lanka have been refurbished and used to attract tourists in the Southern part of the country. In these circumstances knowing the history of a house will certainly provide the edge for the  future business oriented decisions. 

Thus, there are a serveral avenues to search for such information. First and foremost, the property owners could obtain the assistance of the government authorities such as department of housng and lands to get legal clearence of the building. Secondly, people could not only use local newspapers but also could talk to the local community or neighbours to investigate on the history of a particular building which would facilitate to obtain pivotal details. 

In conclusion, more and more people have a tendency to find about history of the shelters they live in. Having legal clearence and historical values could be the main reasons for such initiatives. Hence, the discussed methodologies would assist in accomplishing these objectives.",3,5.0
"In many countries, people have children later in life than in the past. What are the causes of this? Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In view of the fact that a large number of people do not give priority to have a child in their life, this trend has attracted much attention. Multiple factors have driven this transition, and in terms of the security of pregnant women and the long-term social advancement, I believe the problems of this change outweigh its positive impact.

In contemporary society, many people have busier careers and lifestyles far than before. Particularly, women have more educational and career opportunities, therefore they do have the choice to master their lives instead of just focusing on their families. Moreover, the expenditure of raising offspring has tremendously increased to the extent that some families could not afford it. These various conditions justify the change that people have children later.

It is not a good phenomenon for a country as considering that declining birth rates will harm  society advancement. Labour shortages may be the first problem we need to take into consideration. Fewer children now mean fewer teenagers in the future. This demographic change, with an increasing proportion of children, will inevitably cause labour shortages in the not-too-distance future and has a negative effect on  social development. Simultaneously, high-aged pregnancy would drive women to be exposed to danger. Some researches show that pregnant women who are older would more likely to suffer from diseases and bear more risks.

Admittedly, this choice also enables people to have more time to achieve their career goals and parents could have children when they are prepared financially. I can fully understand why some people delay parenthood, but it’s hard to deny that it will reduce productivity in the long term.

In conclusion, as far as the security of pregnant women and the long-term social development are considered, people delay to have children is harmful to older pregnant women and the social productivity, but maybe beneficial for individuals’ careers.",7,7.0
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem,"Currently, most students have been having difficulties paying attention during classes. Although they make an effort to focus on the class it is a hard task. This essay will discuss what are probably reasons for this problem and what can be done to address it.

Firstly, with the advance of the fast-paced world, people are always very busy both in their private life and their professional life and this phenomenon happens also with school-age children. Certainly, the logic for the lack of focus and attention are both the pressure of the parents and a huge variety of activities in which graduates are submitted during the day. For instance, nowadays doing a variety of extra activities outside of the school such as dance lessons, swimming classes the young student has a life as busy as life`s adult. In addition, many parents punish their kids if they do not have a great score in the educational department how if this was the most important thing of life. Both pressures take off the attention and focus of the pupils which can lead to low academic performance.

Due to previous reasons is necessary to promote a healthy life to students once without so much pressure they will perform much better in the educational department. Therefore, parents and schools should incentive the practice of physical exercise as an alternative to outlet the stress. For example, sport is the best way to keep focal point once it teaches about discipline and behaviour. Besides, the family should not overwhelm pupils with a lot of activities. Children need to have the responsibility and duties of a child rather than having the obligation of an adult. The more pupils are overwhelmed, the less the attention on the school subjects.

In conclusion, nowadays graduates should be stimulated with pleasure activities because the pressure will minimize their attention. This essay argued about the reasons for the absence of a focal point in the lives` students and what can be done to tackle this problem.",11,9.0
"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves.To what extent do you agree?","We have various duties in our whole career from the personal life to the social community. It is a common believe that the younger generation ought to very careful to their former generation, specially, when they become old, and week both mentally or physically. I partially agree with this statement. This disquisition will delineate why young people should take care their aged people and how government can help the older community.

To commence with, nurturing the grey-headed group is the must duty for the young team. To elaborate, when these young black-headed people were child, the present older members were so careful about them and tried to nurture with the full of facilities within their ability. So, they deserve assistance as a result of their work from the younger. For example, most of the Bangladeshi citizens look after their father and mother in their last stage of life in light fact that they count it as a part of their responsibility. Thus, several countries around the world try to aware their schoolchildren about the future duties on their parent. However, sometimes caring the older people become so hard in terms of economy.

On the hand, the government should spend some money to their senior citizen. To clarify, the poor community are not able to give proper facilities to their previous family members due to the financial crisis. For instance, Japan government authorities always support their grey-headed people by providing money, and free treatment. Hence, the local authorities should sanction few facilities for the senior, which is ultimately very helpful to their family.

To conclude, the junior community should help and nurture their elderly member as a human common duty within their economical limit, although country’s management ought to grant different scheme to aid the older inhabitant.",5,6.0
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the diaadvantages?","In recent times, decisions are taken by some individuals to bear children at maturity. I strongly believe that the demerits outweigh the merits as these can lead to terrible health conditions for the woman around labour as well as stigmatization in our society. These will be further explained in the essay.

To begin,  having offspring in old age can lead to health complications during birth. As life progresses the human body depreciates,  thereby causing loss of function or reductions in the activities of the body. However having children by an aged individual can make the woman come down with severe complications like eclampsia,  uterine rupture, fibroid and bleeding during and after partum which can eventually lead to death. All these can be averted if decisions are taken to give birth early. For example,  about a decade ago,  a woman of 44 years had her first pregnancy and put to bed after several months but unfortunately came down with a complication after delivery. Furthermore, the society we live in and relatives expect more from a newly married coupllatteey can be tagged as barren due to the delay in bearing offsprings.

However, conceiving when matured comes with its own merit. This creates enough time to plan for the future especially financially. Couples have sufficient periods to plan for their upcoming wards. Plenty of ideas and ample knowledge are gathered to apply after having a children. Also , adequate income is acquired for the family as well.

In conclusion , the decision to wait till old age before bearing children is of great disadvantage compared to the advantages.",5,6.0
It is important for all towns and cities to have large outdoor public spaces such as squared and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that there should be more open squared spaces and colossal parks in all cities and towns. I do completely agree with the given statement and would give supportive points in this essay. 

Firstly, places like parks and gardens with beautiful flowering plants and trees provide an identity to a city or town and undoubtedly provide considerable benefits to the surrounding community.  Furthermore, these are beneficial for personal health as well. 

For instance, children can have outdoor sports, and adults after their busy tiring work life can have a relaxed time as well as can do routine walking in a healthy space. 

Such spaces allow citizens to appreciate nature's arts and to have knowledge and connections with its vast beauty among city skyscrapers, industries and other townhouses. One can easily understand and appreciate this while sitting in the Royal Botanical Garden in Melbourne City or Hyde Park in  London. These cities are recognized by these gardens and attract even tourists.

Another very significant point is about their role in cleaning pollution. As we know, these days air pollution is a major issue due to traffic and factories and it is considerably affecting people's health. Therefore, it is essentially a requirement these days to have spaces on every corner with implanted trees and plants in the form of squared spaces and central bigger parks. Trees and surrounding greeneries clean atmospheric pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. 

This thus keeps people away from many air-borne diseases and stress and they can work more efficiently with a healthy body and mind. 

In conclusion, it is a fundamental need nowadays to build parks in the cities and towns for the benefit of its people and  our earth and I completely agree with the given statement.",6,6.5
"Some people think that governments should change the way individuals live, while others believe they should choose the way themselves. Discuss these both points of view and give your opinion?","Although it is sometimes thought that the way people live should be changed by the government, other people think the government should not interfere with how individuals live their lives. In my opinion, I consider that choosing your way of life is more practical and people should be free to live the way they want.
On the one hand, some people think the government ought to change how others live basically to curtail lawlessness.
In other words, the rate at which people are quick to commit crimes when rules and regulations are not enforced can be alarming. for example, in third world countries such as nigeria where the law is easily broken, there is no guarantee that if the governement decides to change the people's way of life that it will work, because the police officers and those who are meant to enforce it are equally corrupt. Although, the government changing the way people live should also not be forced to prevent a slavery perception. if people feel caged it can lead to rebelling, revolution and outright disregard for the laws in place. thereby belittling the effort of those in authority.
on the other hand, it is often believed that it is better if people have the right to live the way they want and i agree. if the emphasis is on correcting the orientation and mentality of the people from their childhood, that bad behaviour affects their loved ones and the community and inhibits growth. Naturally, human beings copy what they see over a period of time, if they see those in authority doing the right thing, it trickles down to the bottom.
Another reason why people should live freely is, in Africa at the moment, several people who belong to the LGBT community cannot express themselves openly due to stigmatization stemming from the government laws against them, afraid for their lives, they eventually leave and claim asylum in other accepting countries.
In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, i think that people thrive better when their orientation or mindset is directed towards development and therefore they should live the way they want.",2,4.5
"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some today argue that only governments are capable of countering problems in cities resulting from housing shortages. In my opinion, although governments should be the primary actors, human beings can also offer aid.

On the one hand, only governments have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. Governments by design make decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.

However, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. People will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.

In conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform. Governments will ideally enact laws based on the needs of the general populace.",6,6.5
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 
What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.","There is no doubt that using cars are the most common transport way in the whole world, which increase the rate of traffic. The question is, what are the reasons of the traffic problem in some areas in the world and what can we do to stop it? In this essay, I am going to discuss the reasons of traffic and how we can solve this dilemma. 

In terms of problems, the price of petrol is different from regions to other regions. Countries with low price suffer from traffic more than countries with high price. The main reason given to support this claim is that the people will use their car freely without any fear of the cost. To illustrate, Saudi Arabia has less petrol price than Turkey. For that, the rate of traffic in Saudi Arabia is more than what is in Turkey. 

Additionally, alternative transport gives the peoples anther choice to move which will lower the traffic by the cars. For example, using the metros or the trains is suitable for some kind of people. 

Also, the population centres in the main cities which make them more candidate for traffic.

To solve this problem, the governments on these cities and towns should provide alternative transport ways for the people to lower the pressure in the highways and the roads. Likewise, they should try to distribute the population among all the areas in the country by encouraging them to move to the countrysides. 

In conclusion, it is evident that the traffic is a common problem in some countries. Government must ensure steps are taken to prevent this phenomenon from deteriorating further.",5,6.0
Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a well-documented thought that the growth of fuel’s price is the best way to address worldwide issues related to the environment. From my perspective, I wholly disagree with the statement. This essay will analyze how unwise it is to use fuel’s expensiveness as a means to tackle pollution before pointing out the merits of other remedies which are more efficient.

On the one hand, it is understandable for the governments or leaders of some nations to raise the cost of fuel in order to reduce pollution. Obviously, the general public may consider more thoroughly on the usage of this unalterable source of energy, which is likely to result in the decline in daily fuel’s waste. However, it is undeniable that people will face troubles in controlling their finances and some even can not travel around because of their inability to afford fuel. Consequently, the action of boosting fuel’s cost may negatively affect a majority of a nation in the case of transportation rather than help them with raising their awareness in conserving the environment.  In brief, I would contend that it is flawed to take advantage of fuel’s availability to solve environmental problems.

On the other hand, it is better to involve people in planting trees campaigns. First and foremost, trees’ plantations contribute directly to the protection of the environment. The key rationale is that unlike rising fuel’s price which have foreseen shortcomings, numerous trees will dramatically ease the continuous rise of the Earth’s temperature. As a result, most issues associated with the environment such as climate change, which is a worldwide concern nowadays will be addressed as soon as possible. 

In conclusion, while there may be some justifications for attaching costly fuel to tackle pollution, I believe that the plantation of trees plays a more pivotal role in solving the aforementioned issue because of its direct effectiveness.",5,6.0
"In many countries imprisonment is the most common solution to crimes. However, some people believe that better education will be a more effective solution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Whether imprisonment or education is a more effective ways to deal with criminals has long been a heated debate in many parts of the world. Regardless of some benefits of the former, I still believe the latter would produce more long-term results.

          On the one hand, prison can be justified on the ground that it better serves deterrence and retribution than other punishments. The prevalence of incarceration in many countries could stem from a common belief that prisons are a suitable place to execute punishment on those who have committed an offence. If violating the law is shown to come with a severe consequence, those who have served their sentence  might be more wary of re-offending the law when they are released. This, however, could prove counterproductive to petty crimes such as minor shoplifting, or pick pocketing. The criminals of such illegal acts would bear resentment, rather than grow a feeling of repentance like being expected.

          On the other hand, education could resolve problems with imprisonment and better still, bring more benefits in the long run. While detaining criminals may frighten them away when thinking of the consequence of committing a crime, rehabilitation stands a higher chance of making such criminals understand why they should conform to the law willingly. Once the awareness is raised, one possible outcome is that the crime rate would be diminished. This is especially true when it comes to teenagers who can be easily influenced by peer pressure, proper education at school can deter such juveniles from committing delinquency. And even if one commits a crime, he will be more inclined to contribute to society once he understands his wrong, rather than hold a grudge. 

         In conclusion, education instead of imprisonment would be a desirable measure as it can raise people’s awareness of obeying the law and eliminate the resentment one may have after having served the sentence.",9,8.0
"Many studies have shown that most criminals have a low level of education. Some people say that to reduce the crime rate, criminals must be educated within prisons. It will improve their prospects of employment when they are released. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and relevant examples.","It is argued in many research that lack of education is one of the factors of criminal. Some people believe that educating criminals during their captivity in prison will help to reduce crime in the future because they will be able to manage a job after getting punished. In my opinion, I completely agree that introducing education in jell will facilitate criminals to manage a job by learning skills, norms and manners.

The first and foremost reason why prisoners should be educated in prison is that it will support them to see the life in a new way. In other words, criminals will understand with behaviour is accepted in the society and try to earn through the socially approved ways. This exemplified by handicraft business, which is run by a man who got punishment for stealing. In the prison, that man learned basket making process, which helped him to launch his business.

Secondly, education helps any person to take a place in the community. Moreover, when people will see that a prisoner is getting education facilities in a prison, it will be easier for them to accept that criminal after release. Without society's acceptance, it will be difficult for offenders to adjust them into a new life. Otherwise, they will commit crime again if people ignore them. Thus, education is must for the criminals in the prison.

Finally, no people born as a criminal in the world. Poverty, lack of education and basic need drive a person to commit a crime. Thus, it is the government responsibility to educate criminals so that they can lead a life by doing a decent job. For example, in the Netherlands, government aids criminals to do voluntary training, which leads to the country's 1% reoffending crime rate from 10%. Therefore, government should educate criminals to reduce the crime rate from the community.

In conclusion, education is must for the criminals in the prison so that they can find a prospective job by learning skills and adapt to the society.",6,6.5
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do 

unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They 

believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society 

as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?","It is sometimes argued that younger adults should participate in volunteering because it may prove beneficial for society. While society emphasizes to volunteer wor, but I believe that this can either help society or individual. 

There are various reasons why society should not force young people to take part in unpaid activities. Firstly, students always find themselves busy with homework and exam revisions; even sometimes it seems like full time job as their school schedule follows tuition. For example, in India, school children stay from 9 am to 3 pm in schools, and after the visit , tuition to cover up their homework, which is quite hectic. Secondly, they do not have enough time to spend with family, relatives, and friends and that their childhood should be meant  to more playful, stress- free and full of leisure activities. Despite that, society still, believes in getting unpaid work done through poor children who do not have time for themselves.  

On the other hand, volunteering is helpful to develop excellent characteristics in a person, and also useful to get a job in the future. Although there are good reasons to do free work, society can not bide rules or push youngsters to participate. If society takes  actions to increase unpaid work involvement, this will not benefit them; perhaps it can affect severely on their reputation. It can be assumed that young people might choose social welfare or social services after their studies completed. As a result, individuals should be given choices because they could feel pressurized, which can lead to suicidal mental eagerness.  

In conclusion, the community  could benefit from volunteering if youngsters show willingness for involvement in the social activities instead of push over by people.",3,5.0
"money offered for postgraduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. do you agree or disagree?","The progresses of postgraduate research are highly dependent on financial support from governments. I agree that instead of investing in research that barely contributes to the world in a good way, money should go to subjects that could provide solutions for difficulties nowadays.

To begin with, one of the cogent reasons why governments should put the majority of money into certain postgraduate research, including science and medicine, is due to professional areas as such playing essential roles to tackle various issues which need to be fixed urgently. For example, researchers in  science are keen to use clear energies, including solar power, or hydroelectricity, to replace  traditional power supplies, such as thermal power. That is why compared to literature and history, science research provides more practical usage. 

Secondly, it could cost a tidy sum to support the process of research, be it upgrading equipment for experiments, or maintenance fee. Furthermore, some subjects need participants to be involved for a long term, which will provoke a great among of spending. With limited budgets, correlative departments should make good use of it by carefully evaluating research for their potential and practical usage in the world. For example, medical research could provide solutions for rare diseases, which could enhance the life span of human beings. Without financial support from governments such progress would be hard to achieve. 

To conclude, I believe it is necessary for governments to support postgraduate research that could contribute to the world the most, despite that they might need to trade in the opportunities for other professional filed. I agree that governments should provide more financial subsidies to encourage certain postgraduate research to provide useful solutions.",6,6.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In some countries, society increasingly want to learn more about the historical and cultural values ​​of the houses and buildings in which they live.

First of all, I had no knowledge that people had such a curiosity. However, when I saw this article, I suddenly started to think about why such a situation could be. Frankly, I think one of the biggest reasons for this might be social concern. Apart from social concern, people who are interested in architecture and urban planning are likely to engage in such research. For whatever reason, for this kind of curiosity to awaken in one's mind, the building or house must reflect cultural or historical integrity. For example, while it is very rare to find such a building in Turkey, it may be much more common to find such a building in Italy. Apart from these reasons, there may also be those who wonder whether the building has a spiritual past.

I believe that for this research to be carried out, it must have a real historical value. While you can only learn from state institutions or organizations when the building was built and who did it. If this has a historical or cultural value, these institutions may be insufficient for research on it. For this research, it is possible to obtain informal information from the elderly living in the region. If the building really has a value from the past, it would be most logical to research it in places such as libraries that have a special section on this subject. If you are wondering if there is a spiritual event in your past, the only place to apply in this regard will be the neighbours. Of course, this will not go beyond rumour.

Regarding this, there was a house where I lived in my childhood and which was claimed to be haunted. Most people in the neighbourhood put forward various assumptions about it. A common aspect of the stories on this subject was that some electronic devices such as televisions could still work while all the electricity in the apartment was gone. Of course, it was understood that this issue was only a technical problem resulting from an engineering error.",5,6.0

This essay will discuss both views.

On the one hand, it is fairly easy to understand the advantages of studying at university or college. First, the educational institution guides them to have a good foundation for their future life because it helps them to learn what they didn’t learn from the faculty, which cannot be achieved if they choose to work right after they graduate from academy. Second, they believe a higher-level study improves their qualification and the door to a better places. Also, helps to get good remuneration. Professors who are able to give a recommendation letter to land in a good office could be a good example here.

On the other hand, the idea of working straight after high institution is justifiable in some ways. It is common knowledge that working straight after high institute instead of pursuing higher teaching can help youngsters collect practical working experiences. If they do not want to go for another learning process, they can begin to seek an activity as early as possible. As a result, they are likely to start their professional career sooner than their fellows. Moreover, young people can live independently on their own income without asking for financial support from their parents for the reason that they are able to earn money by themselves to meet their basic needs. 

            In conclusion, it seems evident that both going for higher study at academy or college and working right after school are advantageous in their own ways.",6,6.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people think that the getting a knowledge at college or university is greatest way to take a position in every wanted sphere.However, others reckoning that this is better to find employment.Although,there are benefits from working after school,I would argue that it is better to go to university or college .In the following paragraphs,let me elaborate both viewpoints and share my position on this drawback.

The point of start work straight after school is so stunningly solution .Lots of people want to earn money as soon as available.And this is crucial reason to start working after high-school.Because of job,many teenagers are able to get experience to future humanity career.This means that,on account of less responsibility on your head,when you make a significant mistake in your teenager ages,you would have to more chances to correct it than in adult years.But the accomplish,which you can get at the your job time,will be able to help you in your future position in each sphere.

On the other hand,we have to think about new technology on science or on our lifestyle,which is speedly improving by years.Humanity must develop his all sides respectively to new technology.In my opinion,we have to be ready for new generation of technology.Because active evolution of technology poses a threat to humanity that the robots and machines can replace position of people in future.But do not forget that the robots and machines are absolutely without emotions and morality.And because of them Humanity also must be developed,and people should go to university to improve his knowledge about a world and humanity.And this is noticed that consequence from study at university is better than working straight after school for us.

In conclusion,I believe that find employment after school have many benefits for our life,but consequence of ending university would be better.",1,4.0
A lot of old people suffering from loneliness these days. They also lack physical fitness. What are the reasons for these? Can you think of possible solutions?,"A group of elderly citizens is now being lonely due to not being able to move with the younger family members from place to place, as they lack physical health conditions. This essay will discuss the premise associated with senior citizens being on their own in contrast with an explanation of resolving this matter.

There are innumerable individuals who are self-made person and too stubborn to be dependable on someone else, including family, therefore, they face the dire companionship issues because of self-esteem. On the other hand, there are people who long for the love of family members, but, since being busy with work life nor their kids neither relatives, have enough time to spare for them. As a result, they end up in nursing homes in the supervision of a full-time nurse because of a health condition. 

However, just like every lock has a key, there are possible ways to overcome loneliness for an aged person. If each family member takes less time from their busy schedule to spend with the elderly, then situation won’t be this much empty for them. For example, organizing a weekly get together with all the children will cheer their minds. In addition, support groups for the parents and grandparents, where they take a walk in the park, practice laughing therapy with their own agers is a miraculous option to overshadow the isolated feelings.

 To conclude, for a time being, everyone is entitled to face isolation and non-adaptive situations, which doesn’t mean there is no escape to this remote sense. With the help of family and friends, plenty of solutions can be figured out while physical health can be improved by daily monitoring.",3,5.0
"Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, technology's progress has increased  dramatically,therefore, it undoubtedly has a high impact on people's everyday lives . It is agreed, that despite a huge number of benefits,some still argue about the influence that this issue has on society,depending on whether person is rich or poor. This essay, firstly, will discuss some positive  sides of this trend, with the following analysis of drawbacks,before coming to a reasoned conclusion. 

To begin with, a variety  of available technologies causes drastic changes in the lives of people of different economic statuses. The sharp development of different innovations led to the current situation when nobody can imagine their everyday existence without gadgets. For instance, household chores are not such time-consuming as they used to be in past. Moreover,wealthy families can provide some with work, such as cleaning or gardening, so everyone can earn money. In addition, a lot of businesses organize charities and become volunteers so poor receive useful opportunities. In a working aspect , employers can buy training courses ,which enable teachers to earn ,while people in low-paid positions can learn and succeed. 

However, in the desire to get the latest models of gadgets or show off an expensive car , people forget about humanity. Consequently, employees who have lower salaries are deprived of abilities to be equally equipped with modern technologies. As a result,a huge gulf is formed between different classes of society depending on their financial status. What is quite noticeable,is that this tendency to divide people into two groups, has a pestilential effect on children's mental health,as their peers can be cruel to the kind from less wealthy families. 

On the other hand, this issue may become an incentive to achieve success in future. In addition, people who achieve goals through hard work usually appreciate it more and help the poor ones. 

To conclude, this essay supports the idea that modern society is influenced by technology progress a lot. However, despite some drawbacks , people have a lot of advantages which affect their lives in a positive way and can lead to different classes coming together to help each other.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligence robots.
What is your opinion?
Give reasons for your answer including examples with your own experience and knowledge.","It is argued that a number of transnational companies are opening their production plants in poor countries. This approach helps the companies to take advantage of the cheap labour although, it may lead to poor quality products which affect their sale. 

Undeveloped nations provide labour at affordable rates as compare to workers in the developed world. This is to say that there is a huge difference in the currency exchange rates between affluent and poor nations. In addition, there is no standard wage setup system in developing counties which provide the opportunity of paying less wages and employing more workers to get advantage from economies of scale. For example, according to the survey by WorkTech, the Swiss Medicines had employed ten workers in India for a price of single Australian worker on daily basis. 

Overseas manufactured commodities are often sub-standard and result in the poor sale. In other words, every nation in the world has its own requirements for quality assurance and what is acceptable in one country may not be acceptable in others. This difference is a major risk when products produced in developing nations are transferred to developed countries as they fail to satisfy the customer needs thus reduces sale. For instance, in a recent report by Clinical Laboratories, lead and cadmium traces are found in Swiss energy tablets, which are produced in India. These chemicals are banned to be used in medicines in Australia whereas Indian authorities have no objection as the percentage is minimum. This report brings the outrageous response from Australians and company lost a major stake of its customers. 

In conclusion, production of goods in developing countries provides the benefit of saving on labour cost but it also results in the compromise in quality of these.",4,5.5
"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Currently,the way authorities spend money has never failed to provoke debates among people.While some argue that it is not justified to invest in technology for space discovery,  others make a statement that there are more favourable ways to allocate this budget.I am in the middle of these schools of thought,yet the latter still outweighs its counterpart.

It goes without saying that space exploration plays a certain role in our life since it is the way for humans to find their new inhabitants.This dire problem comes from the fact that the Earth’s living conditions have to face tons of threats such as climate change,pollution which mainly stem from the irresponsible and improper actions of humans.These make the natural environment’s situation become more severe and can not be an ideal place to reside in anymore.Therefore,the government should spend money on developing space technology with a view to finding an inhabitable planet like the Earth as a backup plan to maintain human’s life in case having some urgent disasters.

Although the importance of investing in space discovery is widely acknowledged,there are still some pressing fields that need financial support from the governors such as education. Apparently,education has been a backbone of the industry as it creates a well-educated workforce that can enhance productivity and economic growth.Consequently,the government should cash in this kind of aspect such as the scholarships with a view to assisting students who have low income and can’t cover their tuition fee.Moreover,thanks to education,the government will also be benefited from knowledgeable employees.Thus,it is obvious that education should be invested in.

 In conclusion,although discoveries about outer space bring a wealth of tremendous benefits to human beings,the authorities should distribute the budget reasonably to other aspects instead of just focusing on space exploration.",9,8.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve the quality of education, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even criticism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is true that the question of whether students in high school should criticize or make a complaint as a way of promoting the quantity of education remains a source of controversy in education. From my perspective, I agree with the first idea, and this essay will discuss these two viewpoints in depth.

On the one hand, the biggest reason why do not allow the student to make a comment to their teacher due to this issue leads to a loss of respect and discipline in the educational environment. Firstly students still think Impulsive and immature to give accurate comments as a result the review becomes a criticism of the teacher. Moreover, some schools prioritize developing the economy over educational quality which leads to displeasure from students or even parents. for this reason, when students do not feel satisfied with the attitudes of teachers or the quality of education they should make a comment that creates motivation for the schools to solve these problems.

On the other hand, students should be encouraged to give complaints to these teachers. In order to improve environmental quality open discussion between teachers and the students may be a valuable solution. For example, when students feel not satisfied with the attitude of infrastructure in the schools they can consider this issue proactively and discuss it with the teacher, expressing their own opinions so that eventually come up with the best solution. Furthermore, teachers might have an opportunity to adjust themselves to students’ common that has wide various advantages to areas interesting classes and suitable with both.

In conclusion, students are not suitable objects to give comments or criticisms but open discussions will have a lot of benefits to improve educational quality.",10,8.5
Men do most of the high level jobs are done by men. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women ?Give your own opinion.,"In this modern era, people can not get employed easily, although, in some areas only male workers are employed ,therefore , the authorised should be encouraging women also for doing a job and they can reserve some place for women so all females might find jobs.

To begin with, the main point is equality both males and females are similarly important in all sectors. For example , Indian women work in many different fields because of the encouragement and policies. Moreover, the government should take care of women workers in their respective fields , all workers get bonuses equally and also they get promotions for their hardships.

I completely agree with this statement because in the present women can achieve any goals also according to one survey, more than one-third women are working in different fields in all over the world so if this figures could be increased then all states publicans take some rules regarding women sits in jobs because it is also profitable for their growth and economy of nations as well.

In conclusion , in my opinion , it is very advanced and very necessary to include women in businesses because it is not only beneficial for companies but also for the development of the economy.",3,5.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people claim that while studying at university or college will bring a good direction for career prospects, getting a job after graduating from high school will be better. In my opinion, the latter seems more challenging for newly graduated high school students, whereas the former is more convincing.

The most frequently cited rationale for being a worker after graduating is to earn money earlier. When you work directly after school, you will have more time making money, so you can easily afford cars and have your own house soon. I have some friends who have less affluent parents. They work really hard to earn money for their families while other peers are still studying at university or college. As a result, they have their own cars and houses sooner than others.

Albeit conceding the merits of having a job directly after school, I still believe that studying at college after graduation is the optimal choice for your future. When you have a chance to learn in university, you will be taught about the expertise of your chosen major and various related skills that will serve helpfully for your dream job. This will bring you a decent job with high-paid salary in the future, and you can also have many quality relationships (with lectures, friends,...) that help you a lot in your career prospects.

In conclusion, I have a firm belief that the merits of taking a job after high school can not outweigh the benefits of spending time studying at university. In my point of view, juveniles should have a thoughtful consideration about this because this will be the turning point for their future.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. 

What is your opinion?","Many people work for parliament for their whole life such as banks and lawyers etc. Thus, they believe that the government should look after them once they retire since they have worked as normal citizens. While others think that it is the worker's responsibility to care about their own future.So,they should save cash when they are capable of earning.I will discuss  my opinion in the next paragraphs. 

Most of the people who contribute to society  have professions like soldiers and sportsmen.Moreover,there are many circumstances when they have to risk their lives for the nation and civilization.So,it is the government's duty to look after them once they retire by giving them a pension of certain amounts of wage. Because they will not be able to save capital by working on the country's border.For instance, there may be some injuries that can result from not earning payment.

However, in other professions where one does not need to risk his life namely doctor and teacher, should take responsibility for his own future by saving funds in his working life instead of having bad habits to follow ,for example, drinking alcohol and smoking.authorities should not look after them without any special situations.Besides, higher-ups should encourage young ones to save funds. ,also they could hold conventions for their minor employees.

To sum up,Although it is necessary to care for old generations by giving them a pension for their contributions.but this should be considered by authorities per person's job risk and opportunities of saving funds with keeping people’s behaviour in mind before giving them loans and pension since one should be responsible for his own future.",4,5.5
Many jobs that used to be done by humans are now being done by machines. Does this development bring more advantages or disadvantages?,"Nowadays, progress in the world goes faster and faster day by day. For example, jobs that have been done by humans, are done by robots and machines presently.  From my point of view, this tendency has much more advantages than disadvantages. Firstly, it saves time for people to do more important work, such as creating new technologies and doing researches. Secondly, workers now have more time to spend it with their families and friends.

To begin with, high technologies are essential in our modern life. Scientists have a lot of time to bring new inventions to the world, while machines do simple monotonous job. For instance, there were 20% more innovations introduced in the past 3 years. This research, that was published in the BBC in March 2020, proves, that mechanization has a lot of positive sides.

Furthermore, people who used to work hard in factories are now doing a simpler work, such as,  adjusting machine’s work and so on. In this case, they are not so tired at the end of a day, so they can spend their free time more productive and interesting. For example, go for a walk with wife or play some games with kids. That is why technologies are useful.

To sum up, all this examples show, that mechanization has more pros than cons. In my humble opinion, it should be developed faster to bring the society even more inventions and give more time for relaxation. I guess, it will be no work, that must be done by humans in 5 years.",3,5.0
Money should be spent on creating  new public buildings such as museums or town hall rather than renovating the existing ones. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"As people seek a more comfortable and convenient life today, their demands increase and diversify. Some people believe that there are more advantages when the fund is invested in constructing new public buildings instead of renovating old ones. I generally agree with this view for the following reasons. 

On one hand, it is more beneficial for the government to provide financial distribution to create new public buildings because it invigorates the local community and economy. In other words, the government is able to provide advanced services to suit the various needs of the citizens. For example, a modern library which has a cafeteria and a spacious garden is recently built in my town. It promotes relaxation and excitement among the users in contrast to the lower quality of service offered by renovated facilities. In addition, public buildings in new areas can attract many people from outside, which results in raising their popularity and the local economy will prosper with the rising numbers of visitors.

On the other hand, in spite of several advantages the public can gain from new public buildings, there are some negative consequences the government should take into  serious consideration. Indeed, a larger amount of financial investments are required to construct new museums and city halls than old ones. Therefore, that money should be wisely distributed to other significant fields such as welfare and education. For instance, digital learning and improved pension systems are immediate needs in  modern society.

In conclusion, constructing new public buildings is advantageous to both individuals and society. However, the authority should carefully determine its financial distribution to promote the happiness of individuals and the local economy.",8,7.5
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots,"Some individuals consider that eventually all works will be done by artificial intelligent robots. So in my opinion it is bad for factories as well as for population too.

On the one hand, using robots instead of man labors is bad for the factory because there will be problems like lack of electricity and robots can be damaged and that time the factor can be stopped may be for 3 days and it is big problem for the factories. A clear vision is that, recently from the TV program I have seen that one of the important factory of the world which is produced microchip has problem with their robots and for this reason their factory stopped for  13 days. At the consequence of that they went bankrupt the value which s consist from 784 014$ because they can not provide their customers with their product. That is why mans labor is valuably for everybody.

On the other hand, replacing humans labor on robots is bad especially now, that  unemployment increasing day by day.  A lot of people unable to feed their family because they are have difficulties for finding job. However using humans labor is good for the quality of the product because their mind better than robots and they are able to recognize a small problem on the product which is unclear for the robots. For example, from the magazine called «Time» we can see that rate of the quality product higher where used individuals labor than robots. Exactly from the statistics we can know that 3 products from the 100 produced with some problems where used humans labor, when it comes to robots their rate more than 3 times but there faster than human.

Taking everything into consideration, I think that people should use both humans and robots labor because both of them has own advantages for the property of factories.",4,5.5
Some people think that robots are important for the human's future. Others think that robots have negative effect on society. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Over the years, technology has played a prominent role in making informed automated decisions for various spheres of livelihood. There's an ongoing argument that some people think robots are important to the human future while others think robots have a negative effect on society. This essay will take an exhaustive look at both views and conclude with my opinion.

      Robots are important to human features because of the reduction of the cost of human labor it will offer. Many organizations will reduce the usage of human resources and wages/salaries being paid in carrying out various job functions because of the digitalization and automation being offered by robots. For instance, for construction companies construction at the site will no longer be done by various human beings but rather done by an automated creature that will be built based on the role needed to be performed by it. Robots, undeniably will make work easier for different entities on the planet earth and save the necessary cost.

     On the other hand, robots will lead to so many unemployed human beings on planet earth. Many human resources will become unemployed due to the fact that the necessary functions to be carried out by human beings are being done by an automated resource. For instance, chefs in a restaurant will no longer have to cook or prepare a meal for any guest, this will be done by a robot once an authorization is given which may lead to complexity. Undoubtedly, robots will make a person less active and unemployed on planet earth.

  Conclusively, robots will make life easy for various individuals especially the business owner, and also make so many individuals jobless in society because of the alternative given to carry out their various job functionalities. However, it is invariably safe to say that robots are the future of society, especially because the world is embracing technology and its offerings which have helped in the automation of various business processes and its portfolio.",5,6.0
"Money should be spent on creating new public buildings such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that money ought to be disbursed on forming new public settings, for instance, museums and town halls as distinct from the renovation process of the current buildings. In my opinion, the public finance should be allocated to both the renovation and the creation of cultural areas as they are valuable assets of a city independently of the mode of existence. 

Governments should pay attention to conserve historical museums, regional areas or other buildings, as they are vital for a country to attract tourists. Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones. Take for instance, the United Arab Emirates are constructing hundreds of buildings every year to develop its nation culturally, and thus it is one of the most visited country in its region. 

European countries have many renovated museums and halls, and this gives a feeling as you were in a time tunnel. However, newly constructed buildings are also successful at transmitting the ancient texture of that city to visitors. In terms of costs, the renovation can be by far more expensive than the construction of a new one, yet rich countries will overcome this problem easily. 

In conclusion, public settings play an important role in the cultural development of the nation, and thus they are highly preferred tourist attractions. I believe that, money should be spent on both of them. Rich countries may allot more funds for the restoration, while poor ones have to focus on building these with spending the least amount as possible.",7,7.0
"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree","Certain individuals are of the notion that technology makes things even more laborious ergo,things would be less tasking in its absence. In my opinion, I vehemently disagree with this school of thought because technology since its introduction, has been ameliorating all aspects of life, medicine in particular. 

      To begin with, innovation has improved the health sector greatly. The use of high-tech equipment in medicine has helped improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of diseases while at the same time reducing the stress medical practitioners undergo. Evidence of this can be seen in article released by the Chancellor of School of Medicine, Ukraine who stated that medicine had moved a milestone since the introduction of technology to improve diagnosis by detecting diseases as little as inconspicuous tumors to severe diseases such as kidney stones and has also helped treatment of cancer with the use of  radiology. Additionally, the use of technology in medical work has led to advancement in research works. Scientists have been able to synthesize new and effective cure or vaccines to combat infections. 

      Furthermore, technology has helped in the improvement of education worldwide. Teachers from a distance have been able to successfully impact knowledge to their pupils with the use of devices such as iPads and projectors and these devices were used to teach even in the absence of the teacher. For instance, the online learning approach has been adopted my almost all schools nationwide as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak and this has helped so many schools complete their syllabi and even hold graduation virtually. Furthermore, technology has helped bolster relationships across continents. A lot of people these days are engaging in long distance relationships and this would have been almost impossible without the use of technology. Phones, tablets with strong internet connection has helped these relationships stand the test of time.  

      In conclusion, while other opinions may vary, I strongly disagree the opinion that life would be easier without technology because of its impact in ameliorating every sector of our lives is evidently seen.",7,7.0
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is a controversial perspective heating up a debate over that it is not essential for employers to take how their employees dress into consideration since job productivity is the major final aim. I partially uphold this notion.

Without a shadow of a doubt, some people hold a strong view that wearing a uniform irrelevant to one’s work performance and will not cause any negative impacts in the workplace. This can be true since what people are wearing does not contribute directly to most of things they do at work. For example, Facebook and Google are one of some large enterprises that do not restrict how people dress at work because their employees have to spend most of their time at a computer or a desk and what ever they wear, may it be formal, casual, or semi-casual, it does not change the level of proficiency. Thus, some companies may not be affected by how their employees dress.

While the outfits of employees do not do harm to some firms, it may result in some undesirable problems regarding some certain jobs. Having a smart outlook can facilitate the overall assessment of a company by its customers, potentially leading to an increase in revenue and profit. For instance, as a receptionist, a career which relates directly to an enterprise’s first impression so they must dress formally for customers and guests to put more trust in the company. Hence, a certain type of job like receptionist requires people to dress properly so it cannot worsen the company’s productivity .

In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly influence productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work.",7,7.0
Some people believe eventually all jobs be done by artificial intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Near the future robots that produce artificial intelligence knowledge will take over the place of humans in jobs. While I believe not all types of jobs also will be replaced by robots and for some fields, human contact must be needed. This essay will discuss why technically improved machines cannot fulfil all the jobs of human beings.

The technically modified machine would be taken over the easy task job, such as work that does not require any specific talent or complex human skills. And also these robots are not needed monthly salaries and holiday leaves. As a result, many companies will tend to hire these machines rather than people. For instance, the replacement of waiters in Japan by robots. Because of that the serving efficiency of this restaurant become increased and customers also showed positive reactions to that concept. For these reasons, occupations that are not needed specific human skills could be replaced by robots in the future.

On the other hand, there are some specific career pathways that can not take over by machines. Because these are the most needed human senses, which cannot be covered by computer-based knowledge and programmes. These are the jobs that are important for education, medical, social and psychology and can not substitute by a machine system. Finally, robots cannot act in some work fields like humans.

To sum up, there is a high probability of replacing human jobs with artificially intelligent robots in the near. Although, only a few jobs that are doesn't require significant experience and human sense can be accomplished by these things. Ultimately, the most demanded human skills-based jobs will remain while the development of technology.",8,7.5
Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people’s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement.","In this modern and ever-changing world, the advancement of technology like robotic are become more popular and changing the ways people work in many countries.

 People have different views on this phenomenon. Some people claimed that the high-tech machine will finally take over human’s jobs whereas some people are argued that there will be a lot of jobs humans do that AI is not capable to complete. Personally, I disagree with the statement because Bobotics is not fully developed enough to cover all the jobs, like Artworks, Specialist occupations, and Musicians.

It is undeniable that the AI play an important role in people jobs in many countries. Some people are passionate about technology and easily being trapped by the convenient convenience of high-tech. Moreover, they found it provided their business to save time and money by not employ human humen. For example, producing newspapers and magazines. In the past decade , those tasks were completed by labour which meant the entrepreneurs a company owner employed a humen and  have to pay salary monthly In order to run their business smoothly. Another work that people can benefit from using robot is doing house chores, particularly in urban society. Almost everyone are is not only occupied by their workload each day, but also their precious time with the children and family. Therefore, some people are grateful  and thanks appreciate forthe advancement of house chore machines which are valuable for the money as it has helped in terms of saving time and doing boring house works.

On the one hand, On the other hand, /On the contract ,there are several works that are usually being done by human. Fist and foremost, Artwork, this can be the prime example of humankind job that is will never be substituted by Argothrism intelligent procedure because Art is creativity performance from people who has have a particular talent in creating  unique Artwork. For instance, The Mona Lisa painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Secondly, a specialist job                                    such as Doctor,Civil Engineer, and Lawyer. Those are implemented by people who has have a qualified degree to be able to work professionally and communicate with their clients is the most important part while AI robots has are incapable of interaction with human. Finally, music, as we know can only be produced by men who has have the skill like Michael Jackson who is a very well-known and successful musician in the world.

To summarize, although some people are strongly believed that all the human jobs will be taken over by AI Robots in the near future,there are a number of people who argue and think that there are several occupations which will never be cover replace by the high technology machine.In my point of view, even though some jobs are being done by the machine, nevertheless many specialist occupations which can not perform by the advance Robots.",3,5.0
"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by the government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people believe that the government can make laws regarding nutritious food in order to improve public health, while others say that a person has the responsibility for his own health. Although the state can make strict laws about the selling of nutritious food items, this essay believes that people can alter their lifestyles to become healthy.

On the one hand, there are those who think that the authorities can impose strict guidelines on food companies in order to enhance public health. This is because if some food companies and restaurants are not providing food up to the government’s standard, then strict action should be taken against those. For instance, it has been found in a recent survey by The Sunday Times that peoples’ health can significantly be improved when the government imposes strict laws on food companies about the nutritious value of their food items. However, I disagree with this viewpoint because of the following reason.

On the other hand, it is thought that men and women can improve their health standards on their own. This is because they can include more fruits and vegetables in their daily diet and can do some physical activities by making small changes in their daily routine. For example, I was a fatty person and used to eat junk food daily. But when I started doing exercise and eating healthy food by making changes in my lifestyle, I have become a healthy person. Therefore, I believe that someone’s health depends on their own by altering their lifestyle.

In conclusion, although the government can make laws to boost public health, I believe that it is a person’s responsibility to become healthy by changing the way of living their life.",8,7.5
"sudies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","The debate about if an individual become a criminal is highly according to the education background has risen. Some people believe that people who commit crimes because their character is bad, but others think that all communities should get proper discipline that could demolish the bad motivation from a human. I believe that everyone deserves positive lessons to learn how to live with healthy mental status.

After understanding criminals' stories and complex motivations, most of their solutions must tightly originate from their educational background and their living environment. People without fully educated find it is hard to survive and feel society is treating them unfairly. Thus, they are eager to find a way to solve the problem by hunting others or rubber others' property. For example, undeveloped countries have higher crime rates compared to developed counties. People in the undeveloped countries rarely have abundant education resources to learn how to make money. Therefore, to survive, they have to rob or steal to get a penny.

The other point is criminals have the right to learn how to perform good manner with secondary education. A person becomes a lawbreaker is not fully their own fault but also contributed by the society. Therefore, once they made a crime, the public must give them a chance to give the person a second chance to learn the proper way to make money and how to get along with the social community. For instance, jail provides robbers opportunities to learn how to work in a factory. Twisted mind person can learn how to cooperate with others when they are having group living with mental teacher's assistance.

In my opinion, it is undeniable that criminals are formed due to civilization. Therefore, we should provide a second chance for them to restart a new life as a basic human right.",6,6.5
"Many people argue that in order to improve the quality of education, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even critism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respects and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While some adopt the view that students ought to be entitled to comment or even criticize their professor so as to enhance educational quality, others think that respect and discipline loss will be a result of that. I will discuss both sides of the essay before my point is drawn at the end. 

On the one hand, it is generally believed that learners had better be empowered to evaluate their teachers for educational growth. In fact, in  modern days, pupils are inclined to be the centre of the class, which empowers them to raise their voices over their studying issues comprising teachers. If the instructors compelled their learners to follow their path, the youngsters' confidence and creativity would suffer. Thus, it is essential that schoolteachers should encourage children to give feedback, which would help them look back and move forwards. Without such  assessments, the lecturer couldn't internalize new insights from children, contributing to diminishing teaching and learning quality. 

On the other hand, however, there is a widely held view among people that cultural values would be a negative consequence. Having said that, the Asian countries, especially Vietnam, traditionally teaching is considered to be the best career, therefore, it is true that pupils had better listen to and comply with their instructors. Nevertheless, that has not been compatible with  modern educative innovation  these days. If individuals still remained that belief, they would not meet the requirements of the globally general growth, which inspires the youth to debate and express their thoughts freely. 

In conclusion, human beings deem that the young generation should be supported to evaluate their teachers. Meanwhile, others believe that this will mitigate the intrinsically cultural belief. I strongly think that educators had better listen to learners' ideas to have a far superior tendency of their cultivation while students ought to think over before commenting.",4,5.5
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think the advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?,"Social media has become an ever increasingly used tool to connect with the people and to get the daily scoop of the news stories. This essay shall first discuss an advantage of the quick and the easy access to the people and the news that the social media provides, followed by a disadvantage of people losing their ability of having a human connection.


Technology and the social websites in particular, enables us to get in touch with our friends and family at a touch of a button. Not only can people connect with each other from miles away, but they can also be virtually present in important family events to feel more involved in the lives of their loved ones. Additionally, While the people are away from their home, they can keep themselves apprised about what is happening in their region. For example, many students studying in foreign universities stay connected with their families back home via Facebook and Instagram.


On the downside, a big disadvantage these websites causes is it diminishes the need to have face-to-face interactions. When the people can talk to someone by just clicking a few buttons, they neither feel the need nor the importance of meeting someone in person, which in turn makes people more distant from one another. For example, these days, many kids wish their parents on their birthday by posting a message on Facebook unlike in the olden days when they used to do it by giving their parents a warm hug.

To sum up, although social media can give us a rapid connection to the people across the globe, it can make us lose our human nature of meeting people as well. In my opinion, the advantages of social media surely outweighs the disadvantages because humans have an innate ability to connect with people.",7,7.0
"As well as making money, business also have social responsibilities.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","It is commonly true that all businesses are relying on the social community. Being making a profit, the company should take care of the effect that can harm  the public. I agree with the foregoing statement and in this essay, I will discuss my points of view with relevant examples.

The business should come out the strategies for both the community and the company. The most predominant reason is that there is no company that can stand without public support. For example, the drinking water bottle company,  produces their products at reasonable prices as well as maintains their purification level to serve for people to be healthy. Furthermore, they should show the customer benefits which means that their product is outstanding among the competitor products. As a result, the people will see the care from this company and finally they will buy these company products that can increase the business profit.

On the other side, the social environment can knock down the business. There is no doubt that the business cannot stand any longer if  the company is not interested in public requirements. For instance, the customer bought their products at a high price but the quality is not much different from other products. In addition, if the people think that the company is cheating the customer later they disseminate this information from their online group. If the company can't stop before it spread the news that will be too late to control  the company's reputation. As a consequence, the business will bankrupt or shut down the operation.

To sum up, however, all the businesses are affording revenue not only concentrating on profits but also taking care of customer benefits. Personally, I agree that if the company is looking forward to customer satisfaction rather than their profits their reputation will stand longer.",9,8.0
"some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Nowadays, an increasing number of people are getting enthusiastic about searching out their living places and histories in some countries. I think the reason behind this excavation is related to the nature of people's knowing the unknown and also for their personal security. My suggestion for conducting such research would be to collect information from the neighbourhood.

Since the beginning of civilization, people have always been interested in finding out the unknown, such as stories about their ancestors. The curious minds of people make them find out the lineage of the owners of their house. In some countries, it has become a tradition. For example, in developed countries, people always want to know about the history of the land or house they want to buy. If someone cannot find or be convinced by the information about the house, they might not be interested in buying the building. Moreover, the reason why the history of the shack is crucial is to repair or replace necessary things. If the accommodation was built a long time ago with poor materials, replacement and maintenance would be important. For example, many authorities have enacted a restricted law limiting the usable life of a building to about 50 years. After that, the building has to be repaired or destroyed.

To conduct the research, one should first go to the neighbourhood because the possibility of knowing the former owner is high. They can provide accurate information about the previous owner or the history of the house. Second, local communities or local gathering places could be  potential places to look because local people often gather in these types of places. For instance, a café is the best place to collect information. In addition,  senior citizens of that particular area could be considered a valuable resource of instruction because they have been living there for a very long time.

In conclusion, people become more interested in finding out about their livelihood out of curiosity, and it is very necessary to relax their minds.",6,6.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","people have different viewpoints about whether should people put a stop to climate fluctuation or accept it. while i accept that people should stop climate change, i would argue that people should also try to live with it

on the one hand, there are numerous of reasons why the governments and individuals should prevent climate change. due to the rapidly natural disaster caused by the global warming, people might face a great number of difficulties. for instance, storms or droughts have negative impacts on crops. this might lead to sufficiency of sustenance. if there are not any storms or droughts, crops would be intact and therefore there will not be lack of food. additionally, rising temperatures also has horrendus infulences on species. since the temperature is becoming higher or lower, the extinction of worldwide species might occur. for example, polar bears might become calsuaties of climate change due to lack of habitat, which is resulted from melting ice. this may lead to the disappearance of polar bears. if the temperature is persistent, the polar bears would not vanish

on the other hand, individuals should also manage to live with the climate change. the world is getting hotter or colder which might improve our adaption. for example, living in cold place such as russia might boost our immune system. this might lead to a stronger and more flexible body. since there is a rapid development of technology, people might evolve. for example, in the year of 3000, people might have a new form, a stronger, more powerful, intelligent, persistent than the old ones. as a result, people might have a longer life expectancy and have the competence to do everything that used to be out of their league

in conclusion, coexistence between climate change and humans appears reasonable. in addition, individuals and the government should also prevent the climate change",5,6.0
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both side of view and give your opinion.,"Following the increase in children's education, parents and teachers argue that the fine craft classes are a crucial lecture or not. Some sets of people disagree that the painting lecture is a waste of both time and money, conversely, others believe the painting will bring various benefits of young children's growth. I personally agree with the latter opinion, and I will write both sides of view.

In the first place, some folks think that teaching painting does not an effective way to all children. For instance, some children are indifferent to drawing or creating something,  educating craft skills should be considered all young kids' personalities and interests. More specifically, a boy who is not interested in technique class, then he hard to focus on the lecture, compared to other pupils who are eager to learn the drawings. Furthermore, some parents who prioritise practical lesson than potential value argue that students should learn mathematics or science than drawings. They believe that Investing money to practical subjects are more valuable than abstract subjects.

On the flip side, some parents and instructors agree with the idea that art is vital to children's development. On top of that, from the perspective of young students, creative activities help to develop their imaginations and creativity. This is because, drawings and creating lead understand another perspective, for example, when give a kid a topic that draw the happiest moments of their parents, the kid will remind his or her memories, and will draw certain moment with imagination. These lectures will help to raise understandings of others'. Secondly, as far as the nature of art is concerned, it leads to express one's thoughts or feedings through artwork. It will help to not mature children, especially, introverted kids who cannot speak their idea without adult's assistants. In this case, teachers or parents will understand more via the kid's artwork, and recognize their feeling than before.

In conclusion, considering the pupil's development stage and a certain exception case, I strongly believe that the creative activities will play a pivotal role at school. The school and government should pay attention children's fine arts education, and spend more budgets.",11,9.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teenager can learn a lot through working in community in their free time. Many people believe that this can be advantageous to the community and the childrer because services like picking up garbage, helping elders can teach teenages to keep the place clean and tidy, and to respects their their elder.  I believe , however , that they should be paid for their work and time rather than doing for free.

Childrens do have free time compared to adults. When this time is utilsed in a right manner and they are paid, it can motivate them to participate in this activities. In other words, knowing that they will earn through their hard work with push them to paricipate voluntilarity without even have to  force them. For instance, if a teenager want to buy pair of sports shoes, he will work in the community and earn that money rather than asking parents.

However, if they are asked to just work for free, they might end up not perofrming the tasks really well. They will find reasons to avoid performing services to the community. They can be forced to do the job, but the outcome might turnout to be poor. Therefore, it should be complusory to pay, when they are working in their leisure time.

In conclusion,  teenages should be paid for working in the community as it will motivate them. In addition , there wont be any need to force them because they will voluntrialy participate considering the reward they will earn.",3,5.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that the most effective way for children to learn how to cooperate with one another is to engage them in team sports at school. Personally, I completely agree with this idea and will outline several reasons why in the following essay.

Firstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which are essential for effective cooperation. When children are engaged in team sports, whether it be basketball, football, or any other team sport that requires communication between the players, it is essential that they learn how to communicate with one another effectively in order to win the match. This can be achieved through verbal communication, body language, hand signals, or other forms of communication, and by regularly practising the many forms of communication involved in playing team sports, children are improving their ability to cooperate with one another simply through an improved ability to communicate.

Secondly, by taking part in team sports at school, children learn the effectiveness of working together in order to reach a common goal, which is the basis of cooperation. By playing team sports, children are forced to learn how to work together in order to win a match. In many team sports, training sessions focus on drills that train students how to execute certain strategies that require them to cooperate with one another, and by doing so, they get to experience the benefits of working together firsthand. If children do not have a good understanding of exactly how working together to reach a common goal is far more effective than working independently, then they will not have the desire or enthusiasm to cooperate with others. 

In conclusion, team sports help students improve their communication skills and allow them to experience first-hand the results of working together, which will then inspire and motivate them to cooperate better with others in the future",4,5.5
"Nowadays, we are surround by advertising in our daily lives. Some people believe this has a positive effect on society. Others, however, say that it is a negative development. Discuss with both views and give your own opinion.","Advertisements have been part of our daily activities for a long period of time now. There are those who believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks and vice versa. I, on the other hand, believe that there is more harm than good that these advertisements bring.

 

Due to advertisements, we are able to be updated about upgraded products and trends that will surely make our lives easier. For instance, high-end cell phones and devices have been flooding the market and have shown different upgraded specifications and functions. Through advertisements, we are also being offered  the best deals like huge discounts and markdowns on once popular products. Advertisements have been constantly reminding us to check out the latest trends and upgrades. 

Nonetheless, advertisements seem to have become more intrusive nowadays. The means resorted to catching the attention of consumers are barely filtered out already. On the internet, for example, advertisements have been popping up more often that  instantly distract the viewer from browsing the actual content he or she wishes to see. Another instance is paper flyers that have ended up being scattered anywhere in the streets and thus become garbage polluting the surroundings. Every nook and cranny is now covered with sorts of advertisements and has destroyed beautiful scenery. 

In conclusion, advertisements can be helpful in keeping us up to date with the latest improvements that will make our lives easier. However, due to unregulated postings, advertisements may have become more of a nuisance and distraction.",3,5.0
"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important, and governments should spend more money on this.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education has been an important issue across the globe. While educating the younger generation should be given priority over the illiterate adults, in my opinion, they are equally crucial and I agree that the governments should invest their resources in the non-literary group as well.

To begin with, it is important to acknowledge that the young generation is an asset to a country’s development. This is because they are the catalyst for their nation to change and progress for betterment. They are likely to have unique ideas that could revolutionize human life, but without acquiring state-of-the-art knowledge that would be impossible. Technological advancement, for example, in the field of artificial intelligence is already started to transform human life in all possible aspects, such as healthcare analysis, online shopping and autonomous vehicles, which could not be achieved if people were not literate. Therefore, more progress and development could only be feasible if governments prioritize educating young adults.

On the other hand, my view is that literacy is necessary for everyone in society. No one should be left out at this point as all citizens play their own chief role in a country. The reason for this is that adults are often viewed as role models for the younger generation ,especially children. If, for instance, they are not educated, they are more likely could not raise a literate generation, and this ,in turn, could possibly have a negative impact on their nation’s future. A country can only be considered well-developed if the majority of the population is taught.

In conclusion, although the advancement of a nation depends on the future generation, it is my firm belief that the government should strike a balance across both generations in order for a country to grow healthily and steadily.",11,9.0
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the present age, the major section of  society has a mindset to conceive a baby after entering  the thirties. People believe that they should first focus on their career and after being successful, they will plan regarding family life. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.

To begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.

Though  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. 

So, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles.",8,7.5

Earthquakes, floods, landslides and volcanic eruptions, in the short term can have an impact on the victims died, victims of serious injuries that require intensive care, increased risk of infectious diseases, damage to health facilities and water supply systems. The emergence of health problems, among others, starts from a lack of clean water, which results in poor personal hygiene, poor environmental sanitation which is the beginning of the proliferation of several types of infectious diseases.

Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Stepping into the 21st century, thanks to state-of-the-art technologies and the economy, there are more and more complications that politicians and citizens have to resolve. Whereas many folks argue that researchers should prioritize human health rather than other troubles, many roots for the idea that there are more persistent problems needed to be solved than healthy ones. In my point of view, I believe that every domain, which I will delve into herein as well as explain my opinion, should be resolved equally.

On the one hand, health complaints are one of the most dangerous things that experts need to resolve. Recently, it has been the boom of the covid-19 epidemic since 2020, which directly impacts our lives. In detail, this contagious virus can be infected through respiration, thus the number of people contracting this affliction has been increasing day by day. Therefore to end this pandemic before it is out of control, not only an individual nation but also the whole world have to accompany. Pfizer from the USA is the pioneer in experimenting and manufacturing a specialized covid-19 vaccine to alleviate. 

However, there are some domains besides the epidemic that need researchers and government to pay attention to it. Firstly, due to the pandemic that I mentioned above, the unemployment rate has increased. In-depth, many companies, hotels and restaurants have to suspend, therefore, they have to cut down on employees to diminish their losses. Secondly, Russia has been making a proclamation of war with Ukraine, which affects some fields such as gold and oil costs. With advanced technologies, a war does pose a threat to not only citizens in both 2 nations but also the people of the earth unless this war is ended in soon time.

To conclude, healthcare is one of the most essential things that politicians, as well as experts, have to encounter but I also believe that every dilemma should be resolved without any bias",10,8.5
Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, it seems more important for employers to consider the job applicant’s social skills before their academic records. In my opinion, I strongly disagree as not always good social skills are enough to complete a task satisfactorily, as well as having academic qualifications are not a guarantee of dealing with the job appropriately. I believe that the combination of both aspects should be the best criterion in order to select an employee.

To begin with, employing people based only on their social skills would probably be insufficient as they may not be well prepared to do the job. For instance, it has been claimed that, far away from being overrated, university studies are necessary for  society as many people are being formed in short Online courses trying to take faster paths to get a job while the truth is that 90% of them fail getting hired as they profiles are not enough to deal with all the situations of qualified jobs. This means that it is absolutely necessary having reliable qualifications that allow one to work professionally. However, I am not saying that only  academic records are enough, we all definitely need to have acceptable social skills if we really want to succeed in a working environment.

On the other hand, considering the other extreme of only taking into account their academic records it also does not guarantee successful employment. For example, it has been proved that numerous business sales with competent personnel that were not kind enough at the time of dealing with people, were losing sales dropping their numbers considerably. This explains why it is important to understand that qualifications and social skills contribute equally to the performance of  a better job.

In conclusion, employers who think that it is preferable having great social skills than to have professional skills are wrong, as considering one on top of the other, no matter which one is,  would decline in failure as both are truly important. In my opinion, I strongly believe that employers should consider both aspects in order to choose the best candidates,  which the criteria would be performing a good job while using their social abilities to interact with other employees and clients, working naturally as a part of a team.",9,8.0
Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than the negative ones while others disagree. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"In this modern world, young people play a vital role in terms of a country's representation. Youngsters are always allocated with additional duties and their impacts can be seen in both positive and negative ways. In this essay, I will discuss both these views and also share my opinion.

Firstly, it is very easy to learn skills at a young age. Kids will be self-centred and independent by these responsibilities which will shape them to handle real-life problems in a better way. To support my view, I would like to illustrate the survey performed recently which indicates that the young people with more experience can survive in any new place irrespective of their barrier against the culture and language.

On the other hand, people may argue that  young age is the best time to relax and lead a stress-free life. Besides their basic school work, they must not be pressurised with additional work which may affect them mentally. For instance, suicide rates are quite high among the kids compared to the adults due to their inability to handle the stress.

However, a perfect balance is the best solution for this. Students must neither be allocated more than what they are capable of and make them unhealthy nor be assigned with fewer duties and make them lazy and tired. Each one is unique and the parents are duly responsible to analyse their kid's characteristics and act accordingly.

To summarise, young minds pave the way for the future and the country's growth. If they are fine-tuned and embedded with necessary skills and responsibilities for  survival, they will be forecasted as the best leader and leading example for  future generations.",7,7.0
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession, what factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opnion, should be done about it?","It is clear that unemployment has become a tremendous issue for long years due to many factors including recession, lack of appropriate skills, experience, etc. This essay will discuss how these obstacles can be addressed for forthcoming graduates. 

Firstly, freshers and unemployed folks are experiencing continuous failures in terms of achieving a job they desire. Despite working vigorously and building their skills, they are not getting a position they are struggling for which is leaving them helpless. A perfect example is a demonetisation held in 2018 in India, following the corona pandemic in 2020-2022. This has turned out to slow down projects of numerous businesses which in return has caused employees to lose their jobs or lessen their wages. In addition, pupils are not sufficiently skilled during their learning period to sustain working independently regardless of any economic circumstances. Thus, the abrupt fall of the economy and theoretical education nationwide has led to jobless adults. 

However, these problems can be resolved if the government takes a few initiatives which will transform the current scenario for generations. New schemes like loans for startups or free skill development centres for every career can boost  efficient labour, consequently rising the economy. Besides, the curriculum can be changed into more practical with innovative participation of students rather than just theoretical and pressuring youngsters to achieve excellent results. 

To sum up, I'm certain that these above actions will bring in creative and smart young ones who will attain their goals through their talent without relying on companies or feeling hopeless about their future.",4,5.5
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in our everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"It is true that advertisements are relatively popular in modern day. Despite several drawbacks, I firmly believe that advertisements have positive impacts on society.

On the other hand, the advertisements have several detriments. Firstly, viewers often are bothered by advertisements throughout TV programs. To be more specific, people generally tend to feel angry when something suddenly interrupts their moods . Secondly, numerous advertising strategies become gradually ridiculous in separate platforms especially social media leading to disturb significantly consumers. For instance, my country has carried out blocking unknown phone number which was used to advertise their products and bother the consumers if they don’t have buying demands.

On the other hand, the advertisements get people a number of perks as well. To begin with, advertisements is literally a potential field, hence, it also provides countless occupations for freelancers, artists, and designers. To be more clear, Microsoft corporations annually employ more than one thousand employees for their marketing department as a result many youngsters have their dream jobs and stable incomes. In addition, without advertising, we would have less choice because the consumers may not be aware of less-known brands. Indeed, if the market has only a few choices for consumers, the monopoly definitely emerges, and that means increased prices due to reduced competition. Hence, if there is a competition between lots of products, the consumers may have better choices.

In conclusion, though advertisements influence people in different ways, I suppose that advertisements are essential in human development.",3,5.0

How can people research this?","Nowadays, there is a trend of individuals around the globe to discover the history of the accommodation they are living in. This essay will discuss the reasons for this interest, as well as the method for research progress.

Firstly, people nowadays tend to be interested in finding the historical meanings of their house or apartment. For example, there is a TikTok content creator who films video about finding mystery objects in his house that is left from the 19th century, which leads him to a lot of scary incidences, this content is very popular for a big while and starts the trend to find the secret of each house. It is humans spontaneous that want to seek the things they are not familiar with. Thus, this trend happens because folks are interested in the mystical things that are not solved.

More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. some people say that the price increase of fattening food will solve this problem .to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many people become obesity due to eating fast foods and sugary products. it is agreed that government should implement a tax on these kinds of food which price will go up and consumers reduce to use that as a result. I totally support for this ideal and suggest that physical programs should be introduced and encouraged.

Beside eating much fast food, limiting in physical activities is also the reason which make people become overweight significantly these days. These issues will give people many bad impacts such as heart disease or obesity. To prevent those, the high tax should be applied in price for some kinds of food such as fast food, sugary products or fattening food while applying the promotion for healthy ones. Citizens will be likely to reduce use those which are expensive and replace by affordable ones. 

For instance, if the price of one hamburger increases to $10, people will choose noodles or bread instead. 

In addition, beside implementing some taxation  regulations, government should build the sport center with well-equipped for community which will attract citizens to do physical exercises. These programs not only let people keep fit but also reduce some diseases. Citizens who are good health in physical and mental, work productive who finally bring much benefit for the nation. 

In conclusion, to have healthy populations, government not only apply duties  for unhealthy foodstuffs but also encourage its citizens to do workouts frequently by building more sports centre. These actions  will bring benefits for both personal and nation in a result.",3,5.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?","These days, as the number of people increases the competition for jobs raises as well. So, some people think that, If you are an ambitious person and you want a very good course you have to go to college or university, While others believe that a key to a successful race is a straight job after school. This essay will discuss both sides and will draw my personal conclusion.

In one hand, looking for a job directly after graduating from high school and starts from the beginning is considered the best way to build your course, For example, many successful businessmen did not go to university. So, that is why some think that you have a better chance to be successful if you starts early while you are very young.

On the other hand, completing your higher degree such as bachelors or even masters is the best way to get your desired career, studying will allow you increase your knowledge as well as getting social relationships. Moreover, after graduation, you will have a better opportunity than those who have not completed their education. In addition, the salary always will be higher than others who did not complete their learning. To illustrate, if you take a higher degree after school you will gain knowledge, exquisite social relations, and earn a better salary. Hence the belief that complete education is the main road to build a successful course. 

In conclusion, after a careful analysis of both point views, I believe that the key to a prosperous future is the education of all kinds.",8,7.5
Some people  belie that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent  robots. What is your opinions?,"It is irrefutable that humans are eventually replaced by the machines in the world. Some people believe that it is beneficial to the future generation while others argue that it is not completely possible. I personally agree with the latter view. In this essay, I intend to discuss my opinion towards artificially intelligent with the examples. 


On the positive side, it's necessary that some jobs required robots because complex jobs cannot be doable by the mankind. What I mean by this, there are few jobs which require robots intervention to accomplish such as  building gigantic towers, heavy lifting weight and redundancy process. Automation process machines have replaced human labour. The computer manages our banks and tickets at the airport are issued by the robots. In addition, robots have entered into the houses to help with household chores. These computer certainly replace a few of the human jobs. Moreover, robotic surgery is being done to overcome the limitation of human beings. Microscopic surgeries and eye operations can be better done with the help of robotic surgeons.


On the downside, if robots replace human being's work them, they will be a plethora of employers lose the job. It certainly increases the unemployment and causes more damage to individuals. What is more, people would rely on the computer and become lethargic which would lead to problems like obesity. Finally, robots may dominate our world just like what is shown in fiction movie today.


To put it in a nutshell, I pen down, saying that robots might benefit to fasten the work of certain stream but ultimately its create more harm to people. Considering the above points, it is not advisable to choose the robot technology and use where it is vital.",9,8.0

 Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Nowadays children are very modern and they use phone computer and watch tv .Some people think that this is not good while other people believe it has positive effects. In my opinion these views , there are some negative and positive impacts. 

    On the one hand , there are several reasons why watching TV is beneficial for children. Firstly video is informative and learning everything. It serves as portal of information can help more creative and familiar with the world. Secondly , television can make studying enjoyable it has educational cartoons children love to watch . Most teachers prefer to have computer set in their classroom to help them watch tv programs are educational for children.

Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the environmental issues such as air and water pollutions are associated with the high level of fuel discharge. Some individuals believe that the best way to solve this problem is to increase the fuel cost for vehicles. I think that it is reasonable to say that the higher cost might help to deal with waste emissions and this essay will discuss some of the reasons.

First of all, over recent years the environmental situation is becoming even worse than before and the main cause probably would be increasing usage of cars and fuel working vehicles. Many people prefer using personal cars, finding this kind of transport more convenient than public transport, which causes increased traffic congestion and accordingly to more exhaust gases in the atmosphere. The additional taxes could help to reduce the number of vehicles on the road or lead people to use alternative “environmental-friendly” transport, such as bicycles or electro cars.

Moreover, it is certainly true that a fairly large earth area and territory of the ocean is already polluted, and financial resources are needed to clean up and free territories from waste products. Another benefit is that government can spend the money received through these taxes to purify the contaminated areas and even develop alternative energy production which can prevent future negative changes in the environment.

To conclude, as discussed in this essay, there can be plenty of advantages in the decision of higher price for fuel and how this solution can give assistance to global environmental problems.I strongly believe that the benefits outweigh possible disadvantages.",6,6.5
"Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions)","Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task.

Environmental damage is a problem in most countries. What factors damage the environment and who should take responsibility?,"It is certainly true that the environment is closely related to the nation’s destiny, therefore, dealing with natural destruction is a must-do task and a revolutionary mission. In this essay, the writer has the intention to delve into determining the contribution factors and propose appropriate remedies for this challenging question about the degradation of the environment.

  First and foremost,  two primary convincing motives behind the damage should be thoroughly examined. The most noticeable factor could be the spread of growth of agriculture, aquaculture, and industrial evolution, which was forced to maintain to respond to such a crowded population. It is undeniable that no matter how hard international law tries to fix the factory’s contamination treatment process, the massive stress that the environment has to deal with still does not seem to be improved. Moreover, most modern people enjoy a convenient lifestyle with fast fashion and instant plastic and it leads to continuous behaviors that are eco-friendly. The more unconscious of the detrimental habits the Earth’s inhabitants are, the fewer positive opportunities the environment could get a turning point to improve in the near future.

 In other to elaborate on the above-mentioned roof causes, there are certain constructive suggestions. Initially, governments around the world should notice that their direction in development is basically concerned most with the global economy but sacrificing the environment for the industrial revolution is not a positive idea and it should be stopped as soon as possible before all the land and sea are unbelievably contaminated. Equally importantly, each individual might not have such a high standard of living driven by consumption society because nature and clean surroundings are the essential survival conditions that humans need, not this current plastic lifestyle. People’s awareness should be encouraged to be more widespread and increase the environmental habit of shopping: maintaining the hand-me-down culture or following minimalist stuff is not only saving money but also good for the environment’s health.

To recapitulate, mass destruction in nature is an alarming issue that each person living on this planet should take responsibility for. Providing every attention and the smallest action change, the environment will be recovered gradually as it deserves.",5,6.0
Some people think that museum should be enjoyable place to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of them is to educate.discuss both views and give your opinion..,"Around the glove, every year many individuals visit museum and it means several millions in profit for this amenities. Museums are public and private amenities that store items of great value for humans such as portraits, paitings and crafts. Besides these amenities help citizens to get distrated and learn more about its belongings. Although many people argue that museums should be more enjoyable places, others belive that the real purpose of them is to educate children and adults.
On one hand, according to some researches carried aout by specialists, humas tend to learn more through enjoyment. Just as children learn while playing, so many adults prefer to do the same in order to increase their knowledge. Consequently, under no circumstance should learning places be boring. Setting a good example, many teacher have confirmated that is easier to attract pupils' attention by playing while the acquire new skills and knowledge. Besides, this technique is funtional not only for children but also for adults. But others think that is not the real funtion of this places.
On the other hand, traditional individuals refuse to change the way that museums have been managed lately. The most formal and respectful is a learning place, the better for visitors have stated several authorities and it should continue as it has been. However, some of them after a discussion have accepted that some restriction should be modified in order to encourage citizents to visit this places. Proof of this, at the waxworks of the city, chindren under certain age are not allowed to get into this amenity, so that many families select other activities instead of visit this museum.

"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.
What are the reasons for this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","In the present day, most students have been having difficulties paying attention during classes. Although they make an effort to focus on the class it is a hard task. This essay will discuss what are probably reasons for this problem and what can be done to address it.

Firstly, with the advance of the fast-paced world, people are always very busy both in their private life and their professional life and this phenomenon happens also with school-age children. Certainly, the logic for the lack of focus and attention are both the pressure of the parents and a huge variety of activities in which graduates are submitted during the day. For instance, nowadays doing a variety of extra activities outside of the school such as dance lessons, swimming classes the young student has a life as busy as life`s adult. In addition, many parents punish their kids if they do not have a great score in the educational department how if this was the most important thing of life. Both pressures take off the attention and focus of the pupils which can lead to low academic performance.

Due to previous reasons is necessary to promote a healthy life to students once without so much pressure they will perform much better in the educational department. Therefore, parents and schools should incentive the practice of physical exercise as an alternative to outlet the stress. For example, sport is the best way to keep focal point once it teaches about discipline and behaviour. Besides, the family should not overwhelm pupils with a lot of activities. Children need to have the responsibility and duties of a child rather than having the obligation of an adult. The more pupils are overwhelmed, the less the attention on the school subjects.

In conclusion, nowadays graduates should be stimulated with pleasure activities because the pressure will minimize their attention. This essay argued about the reasons for the absence of a focal point in the lives` students and what can be done to tackle this problem.",11,9.0
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.

It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.",4,5.5
"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In the modern era, several people emigrate to other countries in order to search for suitable job opportunities. Some people believe this approach is highly beneficial for family members, however, others think that is a detrimental decision. From my point of view, this trend has several advantages.

These days, people especially those who live in developing and under-developing countries, would like to provide their family members with appropriate facilities and have relatively well-being. As they could not find competitive jobs and suitable policies in these countries, they are willing to move to developed places, in order to obtain a sense of productivity. The abroad countries that it is chosen might have several job positions as well as world-class schools, for example. They are able to know about different cultures and languages, which they are deprived of  in their own countries. Their children could learn a new language and knowledge  in this area, which plays a vital role in their future life.

However, moving to another place with different cultures and languages it can get a little bit stressful, particularly for kids. They lose their friends as well as their extended and immediate families, which has a decisive factor in their growth personalities. This practice has a negative effect on their studying due to the fact that all part of the area is unknown and children get confused about their situation, and it takes ages to children adapt to their new situation and sometimes they are more likely to fail their courses and classes, which  leads to becoming depressed. 

From my perspective, having the decision to move overseas is productive. Firstly, parents could find a well-paid job, which has a positive effect on their whole life.Secondly, as children grow up, they are more likely to become successful in the long run, they could choose an out-standing university, and other facilities, such as playgrounds, and knowledgeable teachers. Although, before moving to another country  it might be good to have a mental preparation for children about the situation of the country and their language, also, parents could require help from the administrator of schools in order to tackle certain issues.

 In conclusion,immigration to a foreign area has benefits for all family members, the lifestyle will be improved by learning up-to-date subjects, and enhancing their skills and language.",8,7.5
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them,"As competition among companies becomes fiercer, consumers today may  find themselves bombarded with a barrage of advertisements from businesses  trying to promote their products to the general public. In this essay, I will  demonstrate how excessive exposure to commercials may trigger impulse buying  before suggesting some of the ways in which governments can mitigate the  detrimental impacts of advertising.  The harms that advertisements may do to people are definite. The allure of  the vivid graphics and imageries often found in adverts may sway customers to  purchase the products being promoted, even when they have no real need for them.  This is reinforced by celebrity endorsements, which usually have a dramatic  influence on people wanting to imitate their idols. As a consequence, people who  watch too many advertisements generally end up with items that they may  eventually have to discard, resulting in a waste of money. The iPhone covers being  sold in Vietnam perfectly exemplify this situation. Their adverts, which feature  prominent pop stars, can be found positioned on the side panels of most websites in  Vietnam. People who visit these pages often cannon resist the urge to replace their  phone covers with the latest models and waste money on a product that would be of  little value to them.  In order to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions,  governments can adopt some of the following solutions. First and foremost, they  need to exercise censorship on all advertisements. Rigorous content check must be  carried out prior to the publishing of a commercial to ensure the description of a  product accurately reflects its actual quality. In addition, there should be a limit on  the number of platforms on which a company is permitted to market their products.  This would effectively safeguard consumers against information overload and help  them avoid making wasteful purchases.  In conclusion, people who view too many advertisements may be lured into  buying unnecessary things, and the proposed steps should be taken to mitigate this  influence of advertising.",2,4.5
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing shortages in large cities have become a serious issue, leading some to believe that only the government can provide a solution. I disagree with this statement as I believe that even if the government may have a primary role in solving this issue, others can also contribute significantly to tackling the situation.

It is true that governmental action is essential to resolving the shortage of houses in major cities. One way in which this is achieved is through legislation and policy-making, whereby the government can implement measures to increase the supply of affordable housing. For instance, they can enact zoning laws to encourage development and finance the construction of affordable homes. Additionally, the government has the legal power to ensure fair practices in the housing market and promote responsible development. For instance, they can levy higher taxes on the ownership of multiple properties, which discourages such practices and thus leaves more affordable houses for lower-income residents.

Nevertheless, I believe that the complexity of the housing crisis necessitates collaboration among multiple stakeholders, particularly private entities and nonprofit organizations. Regarding the former, the private sector has resources that can be mobilized to facilitate the construction of affordable housing projects. Thus, with appropriate incentives such as tax breaks or expedited permit processes, the government can involve private corporations in the construction and management of affordable housing units. Nonprofit organizations and community groups also have a significant role in mitigating the housing situation. The reason is that they possess a deep understanding of local needs and can properly advocate for marginalized populations. This can be done by connecting vulnerable communities with financial backers and philanthropists who are willing to make substantial contributions to the building of a shelter for those at risk of homelessness.

In conclusion, while the government may play a central role in tackling housing shortages in large urban areas, I disagree with the view that no other parties can contribute. In my opinion, the lack of housing for citizens can only be effectively addressed with collective efforts that involve private companies and community organizations.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the houses or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","People from different countries have been trying to find out more about the past of houses or buildings they live in. Usually, humans are curious to learn more about historical facts and cities’ architecture may be a good way to understand them. Since finding information is not always an easy task, people who are willing to go further on this research should visit the City Hall of their city to start. 

Studying the architecture of certain place is a good way to understand more about history, especially when it comes to culture in general, such as traditions and religion costumes. The architecture is a mutable art that changes according to the period of time and region, so it could be the most important feature to understand the background of a specific location. For example, the architecture of the Roman Empire, one of the biggest empires in history, can be seen in several European countries, so by analyzing houses or buildings, people can have a sense of plenty historical facts that are related to this empire, like time, important battles, and culture. Therefore, analyzing the surrounding architecture of a site is an incredible source to learn history, but knowing where to start the research is also very important. 

	In order to find out historical information related to the architecture of certain place, people can reach out to the city-Hall managers. This could be a good start, as the City-Hall usually have register of past owners of each house and building in the city, since it is mandatory to register property when you acquire one. From this point, people should be able to find many interesting facts about the site’s background, for example, who was the previous owner, when they lived there, for how long, where did they come from and so on. Considering that City-Halls usually store a diverse range of registers and data of the population, these places should be a good source for those interested in learning history.

Therefore, some individuals encourage visitors to be ""responsible tourists"" who protect local culture and the environment. However, it exits some people consider that it's difficult to achieve the standard of a ""responsible tourist"". As a result, in the following essay, I will demonstrate my opinion. 

First, the local scenic area has no measurement or facility to restrict people from doing certain immoral behaviours. For example, if a person carries many litter and he or she wants to alabelon them into a trash can, but there have no trash can so that some people have alabeloned rubbish anywhere. Second, it depends on behaviour habit of tourists, some tourists have low quality, they will take away  some souvenir like stones, soils etc. Meanwhile, we also carve writing or design on trees or walls.

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession, what factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opnion, should be done about it? 2","A section of University degree holders fails to receive their dream jobs. The foremost reason behind this, to me, is the casual behaviour of most of the higher secondary school students while selecting the subjects. To handle this problem, pupils should analyze their career prospects prior to selecting the subjects.

 As far as underlying factors are concerned, most importantly,  It might be due to unawareness about their natural aptitude for subjects and associated job opportunities in the market. Apart from this, most of the school graduates are teenagers and this is the stage when children are the most adamant. This fact leads to several confusions in their minds.  For instance, taking physics and chemistry just because of peer pressure, will not allow one to compete with his  counterparts. So, as a result of which  many graduates face frustration when they are forced to do work that they do not appreciate. 

With regard to solutions, It is extremely essential that school authorities organize counselling sessions for higher secondary students to make them aware of further career prospects, and also assist them to understand their strong areas. These types of programs provide individuals to opt for appropriate subjects for their tertiary studies. This further helps them to excel in their performances in university. Finally, dedicated university graduates succeed in achieving their chosen profession.

 In conclusion, I would subscribe to the view that an unguided and unassisted way of learning is a major factor towards job frustration, and one of the effective ways out is to avoid this situation is to assist school graduates in setting a clear and achievable goal.",8,7.5

There ave many urgent and serious problems happend in this world. Some peope claim that most of urgent issues can only be addressed with international cooperation. I would partly agree with statement.

Admittedly, part of urgent problems only can be trackled by cooperation with other countries. The assistance of internation is more powerful and immidated. Take war for example, if somewhere happens war, the residences would face the situations, like injury, homeless, the lack of food and drink, and even the threat of life. Above these problems, domestic government cannot solve these by themselve.The only method is via international cooperation, internationa orginazations or the goverment of other nations will assist to address these problems, about numans rights, like rescuing the locals, offering necessary resources, and providing the shelter oversea for these refregees.

Conversely, not all of issues can solved by other countries, such as crime rate.

The domestic goverment should be capable to trackle these problems by themselve, instead of relied on the help of other countries. Despite of this, the local goverment can also ask the advices of other nation as references of improvement.

"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The overconsumption of fossil fuels has become a major topic of concern recently. Some people suggest that increasing the fuel price can be the solution to cope with environmental issues.  Personally, I believe that other measures should also be given equal consideration.

Firstly, increasing the fuel expense cannot minimise the global dependence on fuel. It should be first noted that even when the price of fuel increases significantly, people still cannot cut down the tremendous demand for petrol at once. For example, in daily life, people still need to use their cars despite the fluctuation in the petrol price. Another clear reason is that petrol is also intended for other applications in manufacturing industries and agricultural purposes. If the price of fuel increases, the national economy could suffer many unfavourable consequences.

When it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, some measures should be taken to mitigate the problems of overconsuming fuel. The most practical measure at the moment is to reduce the demand for resources in daily activities like traveling or production.  This can be done by encouraging people to turn to mass-producing energy-efficient products like hybrid cars or implementing new saving energy technology in manufacture. Besides, the most sustainable solution is to lower the reliance on fuel by taking advantage of alternative resources. Wind and tidal power in the Netherlands, nuclear power in Japan, and solar power in the United States have all proven their efficiency in energy in energy production. These could be employed in other parts of the world to minimise the global dependence on fossil fuel.

All existing data above shows that only increasing the fuel price will not reduce the global warming effects. Some strong alternative measures need to be implemented to tackle this situation.",6,6.5
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","While some people believe that teaching art to children is important, others, think it is just a waste of time. In this essay I will discuss why studying art is important but also why some people think the opposite.

Teaching art in schools could have a positive impact in children as it helps them to develop creativity skills that are necessary in every activity or job later in life. In fact, especially at a young age, students needs to express their emotions and characters through artistic activities. Moreover, studying ancient art as well as contemporary art might motivate some of them to become artists or art professors at university.

However, in todays world most of the job positions require a strong knowledge in mathematics. 

Because of this, it is surely more important for young students to spend more time studying other 

topics instead of learning ancient art. For example, if you are very good at math you can apply for universities such as software engineering and you will probably find a job right after your studies. In addition to that, it gives you a better salary which in turn will allow you to be indipentend at a young age. 

To conclude, it is importnat for children to study art and develop creativity, however, in this modern world it is advantageous to spend more time learning math and other scientific topic as it will be easier to apply for a job.",0,<4

It is a simple supply-demand pattern, in which they try to provide the audience with something more required. Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events. This could be a bad example for teenagers who take them as role models. When the life they want is not offered, they can become depressed and, worse, rebel against their families or can behave inappropriately. 

In fact, some celebrities are often found in smoking advertisements, charged with drugs and other criminal activities. A young person who chooses this kind of famous person as an idol will be able to damage their health. Another example can be the impact of a particular celebrity's bad roles in films or series. For instance, Sanjay Dutt, Bollywood Actor is well known for his money and roles as a villain, his terrorist acts in different movies have given rise to violence and crime in the streets of Mumbai, all these were committed by adolescents for thrill and adventure.

In brief, because of the information age, children and adolescents are informed by watching TV, using social networks, and can follow celebrities on these platforms as their role models. If the younger generation is not properly guided, such things can have bad effects on them.",8,7.5
Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Elites are always concerned about subjects studied at school.  These days, wheather students should study international news at secondary schools or not has became a matter of debate. I reckon schools should spend their limited resources on more practical subjects.

On one hand, the main purpose of schools is to train work force for the industry. As a result, the school's authorities have to make sure that students gain usefull skills to get a job. For example, there is a high demand for computer skills in the industry, and in this regard, it suffers from a lack of work force. Therefore, if the education system allocates its resources to improve this skill at secondary schools, it would contribute to the growth of industry in the future.

On the other hand, teenagers are not mature enough to understand the international news. For instance, the international news is mainly about the macro-economy, politics, cutting-edge technology, and wars. As a consequence, students, at this age, are highly unlikely to understant the concepts behind the news. So it will waste all the time and efforts. Moreover, it could be also harmful to students. Imagine a child following international news about wars, global warming, or shortage of water. These news are stressful, and may bring about nightmares to him.

In conclusion, I am strongly against studying international news at secondary schools. Because not only education system has more important tasks to achieve but also teenagers fail to manage to handle both the concepts and consequences of the international news. Therefore, it would be a total waste of limited resources at schools.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that time spent on television, video, and computer games can be valuable for children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In this modern era of globalization, we can easily spend our time on electronics, some people from children until older ages can use modern technology. Such as television, computers, video games, and many more. Otherwise, many people use the wrong way of technology which can be detrimental, in this essay I will argue that there is neither a positive nor negative impact to using digital gadgets among youngsters.

To begin with, many cases in social media share about the impact on children if they become addicted to gadgets, these cases are because people around them introduce video games or TV shows to make the children calm down from tantrums, or if the parents can do other things besides of keep them. In most cases, most kids get diseases from modern tools because the children use them. For instance, children have red eyes because they are always over to watch screens like gadgets and TV because of this teenagers can easily get a headache. This disease can become cruel if they become addicted.

However, it is not all bad, because, in the fast-changing era, children can adapt so fast, they easily become fast learning, For Example, children can remember a song or people that they have seen on the screen or the music they always play every day. These cases can make a child develop as much as possible. 

To summarise, there are various advantages and disadvantages to letting children with modern technology, just as the parents have the important role of controlling their children's consumption.",7,7.0
"some people say that fashion affects our lives in a negative way. However, others say that it has more positive effects on our lives.

discuss both views and give your opinion.","Over the last two or three decades, the fashion industry has been improvised as compared to the past. However, some cliam that fashion influences people lives in an adversely, others say that this has more positive effects on our day-to-day lives. This essay discuss the both viewpoints and give my opinion in the subsequent paragraphs. 

On the one hand, fashion industry plays a crucial role in country's economy through import and export cloths and materials. There are massive amount of the public can get earnings from this sector such as wavers, tailors, shopers and etc. Fashion changes in every occassion, every year by the fashion designers, they are the main reason for the innovation in this sector and people also can wear new trendy dress. For example, many boutiques have started by the fashion designer and they attract the population by their new designs with what kind of material they use. Therefore, mankind are able to obtain enormous benefits in their lives. 

On the other hand, the negativities of this trend cannot be ignored because it affects folk's day-to-day life differnetly which means humankind spend more money to buy new trendy dresses even they have plenty in their wardrobes. It  stimulates more buying capacities, as a result, mankind might be dressaholic. For instance, a recent survey from the Times of India said that, Indian people have spent 40% of their earnings on buying cloths which means they are being dressaholic and addicted, besides, they should save their salary for their future because anything will happen in future like if happens any medical emergency, saving money only will be helped rather than dress and fashion. 

To conclude, Fashion field is an inevitable in people lives. Although it gives a plenty of advantages to the population such as livlihood and wear new trendy dress like celebrities, the public spends huge amount to buy many dresses and they become addict.  In my opinion about this, fashion brings more benefits to the population in their everyday lives and it provides more positive too.",2,4.5

"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, poverty remains a pressing issue in all developing countries. Some people support the opinion that education should be free  to at least read and write, while others are opposed to it. However, I strongly agree with the given statement due to possible reasons such as a decline in the illiteracy rate etc. and the following paragraphs will expatiate both stances with lucid examples.

To begin with, the first and foremost point to agree with this notion is, that it is beneficial for  low-income people. To explain further, many kids are not even able to acquire the basic level of learning because of the financial crisis. According to the American survey, 80% population of the country named Niger is illiterate because of less budget. Thus, providing lectures without fee gives them a sign of relief. Secondly, children are the fortune of the state which means free teaching is not only helpful for parents but also for the growth of the nation such as doctors, nurses, scientists etc. To illustrate my point, while people are developing their states, they need a strong economic level, that they can only maintain by educating the community such as the import-export business of oil etc.  

On the other side of the argument, a few folks believe that it is a wastage of money as good teaching is not only based on a free curriculum but also on the infrastructure of classes, and highly educated learners. This means, the government should either spend money on all these things or  not. To exemplify, the free teaching system of the developing states such as India etc. is still focusing only on grades which is just a waste of money as the kids can not grow because of the burden. Moreover, a lot of human beings prefer to educate their kids in private centres because of their disbelief at the low level of teaching in the government schools.

To conclude, there is no  doubt that  half of the community likes to send their kids to private universities, besides that it has more positive impacts such as helping the low-income living beings by providing a budget-free lesson etc.",4,5.5
In some cities and towns all over the world the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?,"Heavy traffic is one of the most serious issues in busy cities such as New York, London and Tokyo.  People often waste their time and gasoline just to escape from a traffic jam on holidays. What is worse, the traffic problem prevents an efficient transport of support to the damaged areas after  disasters such as an earthquake. In my opinion, this can be attributed to several causes and there are several possible measures to implement.

First of all, our unconscious behaviours often bring about a traffic jam.  People tend to drive at a peak time without  consideration, which ends up creating long queues for a similar destination. To solve this,  the only logical action is to slightly change the time schedule and  avoid rush hours. There is no benefit to being in a long tailback. (gridlock/ bottleneck./a town-centre bottleneck/ tailback/ snarl-up) on the way and with a small shift in plans they can. spend less time in traffic and more precious time  where they want to be. In fact, some thoughtful people leave their homes  in the early hours and spend about half a day at  Tokyo Disney Land.

Furthermore, the delay in road maintenance also creates congestion in countries with various natural disasters such as Japan, or China. Frequent earthquakes make cracks on the road surfaces and require repairs for a while, from which . traffic jams inevitably arise To overcome this situation, constant road checks by authorities can be one solution. They inspect important roads  at night and find the possible flaws  at an early stage, which diminishes the timespan of repairing. 

To conclude, traffic problems are mainly caused by unthoughtful actions and road repairs, and the solutions would be optimal private planning or constant road inspection.",6,6.5
"Some people think that providing many TV channels is a great thing, but others think that this may affect the quality of TV programs. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The given Brandfield city’s map designed by city planners, illustrates the two proposed locations S1 and S2, for a new shopping mall.

Overall, the first site recommended is situated in the northern city while the second site suggested is in the southeast of the city.

In terms of the first proposed site (S1), it is located to the north of the ‘City Centre’ just below the northern junction of the road and the river. The ‘Housing Estate’ could be located on the northwest direction. Furthermore, construction is proposed to be on the land between the west of the river, south of the road and north of the railway line. 

Regarding the second suggested location of the shopping mall, it is almost in the southeast corner of the city, in the middle of the space between the road and the railway line.

"Some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through other media platforms. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the modern technological earth, some people think that media platforms are the best sources for reading news and articles. In the mean time a few others believe that conventional newspapers are the eminent sources, when it comes to news reading. In my opinion, using technological sources is the best way to get to know the information happening around us.


Firstly, newspapers cannot cover all the topics that are being held around the world. Moreover, we are nor aware of the current sensations. For instance, when we analyse an average, ordinary newspaper, it only covers the general topics around the globe like  Economics, Politics, Health, and Science. Therefore, the availability of different information is limited to an extent.


Secondly, the e-sources cover a wide range of subjects all around the world. In addition to that we are notified with the current happenings and situations taking place in different parts of the world. For example, if there is a sudden earthquake or any kind of natural disaster happening around the globe can be seen with evidence through e-sources via modern innovation techniques. Hence, it leads to a faster operation, and mitigates the time requirement for the news to arrive.


In conclusion, due to the abundance of various online platforms, people need not to rely only on newspapers anymore. Furthermore, they are not limited upon the contents, and also it eliminates the inconvenience caused while carrying newspapers where ever they  go. Lastly, it doesn't depend upon the circumstances and conditions for operation.",11,9.0
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Thanks to the development of the world, life has been easier for most people living on the Earth. However, the convenience of the modern world has built up the laziness and other factors which make its residents acquire a negative lifestyle. Discussions have been raised whether to pay national budget for sick individuals or to elevate a healthy lifestyle. While critics consider infected people to be worth paying, I believe promoting beneficial lifestyles must be the priority.

        Not surprisingly, healthy ways of living provide inhabitants variety of profits. People who process a positive lifestyle enhance both physical mental heal day by day, which contribute to their joyful life. These residents tend to have the ability to cope with stress, complex problems and develop a strong resistance to diseases. As a result,the number of infected cases would shrink sharply, which can one day end the vicious circle of paying for those people. In addition, scientists and researches had proved that living with healthy lifestyles is a way to lengthen our duration of life.

        Another striking point is that negative lifestyles would be promoted passively by the investment of government in treating infected patients. Since these patients are supplied financially with their treatment, people tend  to have a minor concern about the way they are living. As a consequence, residents tend to maintain their bad living habits regardless of the troubles they might bring.

        In conclusion, I restate that the state budget should be invested for elevating profitable lifestyles. If governments divide public money to both areas logically, I believe the whole society would be dvantaged.",5,6.0
"Some people think that in the modern world we have become more dependent on each other, while others think that people are now more independent. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The swiftly evolving modern society has been deeply changing the live pattern of all the people. Especially after we steping into the era of the internet , everything that had been considered a complex task can be easily finished without too much effort. Some people thus claim that we are associated more and more tightly.

These statements are not groundless. Under the onslaught of the trend of globalization and the growth of the technology, the boundary between everyone is becoming more and more opaque. As a result, the efficiency of communication has been significantly improved, which means the interconnection between all the people is becoming more and more strong. Take social media as an example, we can now make friends with people who have different nationality on the social media with a tap of the Screen, with whom won't have any connection with you in the previous decades

Opponents of this view also have their reasons. Our quality of life is being paid as a price for the speed of the development of modern society. Therefore, people seldom have time to socialise with others under onerous working burdens. Someone even don't know their neighbours' name, which means they can only recourse to themselves when they are facing some unexpected situations. There's    more and more nuclear families in the cities eighter, which make it hard for them to maintain the relationship with their relatives. 

Both sides have their own reasons, while I think they are all compelling. Modern society provided easy access for the communication of each other, but the physical distance did become harder and harder to transcend.",2,4.5
"Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is a sport that draws many visitors and a steady stream of new athlets. But that might be suprising, since it is a violent sport that often results in serious injuries of the participants. As a developed society, who at large condemns fighting, the continued interest can be seen as undermining our values and beliefs.
While using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. Everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. Furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. Those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. Additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.
On the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. The promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. Since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. Another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. Frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.
While I can understand that boxing is not for everyone, I think that the personal freedom of everyone involved should be respected. Because at the end, nobody is forced to watch or take part in a boxing match.",6,6.5
"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some poeple think that interviews is not a reliable mthod of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Interviews are a common selection method for many companies, but they are not the only method. Other methods such as skills tests, reference checks, and work samples may provide a more accurate assessment of a candidate's abilities and fit for the job.

While interviews can give an initial impression of a candidate, they may not provide a complete picture of their skills, personality, and work style. Interviews may also be subject to biases, such as unconscious biases or interviewer biases, which can affect the outcome of the selection process.

Additionally, some candidates may perform well in an interview but not be a good fit for the job, while others may not perform as well in an interview but have the necessary skills and qualities for the job.

Therefore, while interviews can be a useful selection method, they should not be relied on solely to make hiring decisions. Combining interviews with other selection methods may provide a more comprehensive assessment of candidates and increase the chances of making a successful hire.",2,4.5
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, people sometimes argue that it is time-consuming to read newspapers or watch news programs because news is not associated with their lives. Personally, I completely disagree with this view due to several long-term benefits news brings to us.

There are a number of reasons why I approve of this. The most frequently cited one relates to the strong relationship between individuals and the community. Apparently, the news presented on such means of mass media has a great impact on our lives. These are the current affairs that residents need to notice and take concern, from several local information such as education and lack of clean water to a variety of global issues, which are climate change or ozone depletion. Each one plays a significant role and we cannot deny their benefits to bring us a wide range of knowledge about the wider world.

Secondly, it seems evident that news is an enormous source of information with  value  for citizens to anticipate and well prepare for their future. There are those who always keep up with the latest news and are ingenious  so that they can recognise the tendency of society to develop their own advantages. Furthermore, the news is a crucial need owing to its positive purposes. For example, good news may bring about a good sense of confidence and belief, while  bad ones may warn us about the barriers we have to tackle. As a consequence, we can find the most effective method to encounter these obstacles.

In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I believe that news has various merits in people’s lives, which are a useful source of information and the intimate knowledge we can learn from it.",7,7.0

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The potential increase in global media has brought a great change in the education system, where some commentators argue that it is important for teenagers to know global news as a part of their study programme. However, some analysts defend it is unnecessary and a waste of time. I strongly believe learning international current affairs help teenagers to understand what is happening in the world. This essay will explain the importance of current affairs as a part of school study programme by taking examples from recent studies. 

To begin with, bringing global current affairs as a subject in secondary school will help teenagers to be competent with current changes across the globe. The main reason for this is, studying global news at school stage will potentially inspire them to bring change in the future. The recent study from The University of Melbourne of Child Psychology, revealed that 65 % teenagers set their life goals by looking at current affairs news. Perhaps, learning global news at secondary school level will help them to know what to do in future. 

Secondly, secondary school is the perfect age for the teenager to get inspired. However, there are some drawbacks by bringing global current affairs as part of study programme. Firstly, teenagers will attract to negative news very easily than positive. Moreover, due to lack of maturity, they might take wrong decisions. The recent study of Child's Crime, Psychology shows that, teenagers are the most vulnerable group to attract for crime. As a result, adding global news in school study programme is not a good idea. 

Considering all this, I firmly believe that global news in secondary school as a subject will potentially benefit the teenager to understand what they want in the future.",3,5.0
Many people think that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Generally,office interviews are the best part to analyse the aspirant and learn about him.However,there are some people who don't approve of the following idea and believe that there are other factors that can help employees assess whether the contender can be hired or not for the particular position.I suppose,there are other several ways to know better about a aspirant, including the interview as well.  

On the one hand, as it is vividly seen for all of us , job interviews play a key role in hiring any employee. Because the majority of the interviewers can know a lot about an applicant on the first day of their meeting. The first day leaves a great impression ( whether it is positive or negative) on both sides. For example, if an interviewee is late for an interview we can conclude that this employee is not quite responsible and won't show satisfactory results later as well. Moreover, during the ,interview an interviewer carefully checks all the details and small items of a person and can tell many things about him/her.

On the other hand, according to another group of ,people there are some other ways that can help us judge an employee. Many bosses usually use a wide variety of methods and one of them is, giving a worker tougher pressure. They tend to pressurise their employees by ordering them multiple tasks and by this they find whether they can get rid of that moment wisely or not. Additionally, observations during  work time can also be handy in cases where we should decide on a applicant whether he is suitable in a labour market or not. 

Our discussions above show that, there are certain factors excluding interviews that can help us find out better about an applicant in a profession market.",3,5.0
some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Many believed artificially intelligent robots will soon take over most jobs from human beings. While the robots’ ability might fit well for most repetitive jobs, it is difficult to replace jobs that require human creativity with the A.I. This essay will discuss why our creativity at work is difficult for AI to imitate in certain occupations.

For duties requiring a same standard, the artificial robots might be better candidates than the humans. Robots can be programmed to execute repetitive motions which make them a perfect task force of production to meet strict quality controls. For instance, in Japanese catering industry, most procedures in fast food production are operated by the machines, thus the taste and outlook of each frozen meals are all identical. Therefore, it is foreseeable that many of the similar tasks could be delivered by robots instead.

In contrast, jobs that involve human creation might be difficult for machines to perform. Human’s ability in perceiving and expressing news ideas are unique; it cannot be duplicated by programming. Great authors touched hearts of millions by observing the humanity and deliver in a story; artists communicate with their audience by paintings or sculptures and the emotion resonates with our hearts. Even if we programme robots with the most versatile vocabularies or the best art-crafting techniques, robots could not produce masterpieces like “Crime and Punishment” or “Starry Night”. That is the reason why in some aspects machines could never win over human beings.  

To conclude, robots are expected to become dominant in jobs in specific areas. Robots are highly qualified for repetitive labouring; whereas jobs that require imagination might not be at robots’ expertise. Ultimately, few occupations might still be safe from robots’ seizure comparing to the major robot employment in the future.",8,7.5
"In some cities, people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. Why is this case? Which development do you think is better?","In modern society, crime rate has been rapidly change compared to the earlier decades. This essay will explore which are the reasons influenced by the main problem and express my view in the end.  

First of all, in different parts of the world, people prefer to use  bicycles rather than cars. It has a number of benefits, such as it will help to enhance their energetic level. In modern society,  half of the public suffering from obesity, heart diseases, high blood pleasure…etc. If you using bikes you could reduce illness and increased the level of energy and boosting the immunity system. Moreover, people could use the bike-sharing scheme and it would be more affordable price compared to  cars. In recent years, CO2 emissions have also high and  environmental pollution has been increased as much more.Cycling is more popular in different parts of the globe and it will help to decreased pollution and traffic level in the urban area.

On the other hand, some people prefer to choose cars. Because it has a number of advantages rather than drawbacks, such as being faster, comfortable and more convenient. In modern society, we can use driverless or electric vehicles as well. Technology has changed our daily routine. Many people have to work on  busy schedules. If you have a car you could use your vehicle to going the workplace, the market, university and it would help to save your valuable time. However, it would be very easy rather than raiding a bike.

Finally, from my point of view, according to  modern ,society people need to get cars to fulfilling their basic requirements. I would agree with that second statement. Because comparing with earlier decades people mind has been changed.",8,7.5
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of population who are aged 15 and younger. What is your opinion of the current and future effects it may have in those countries ?,"The young age population have an important impact on  society, so some nations have the policy to increase that population number. From my perspective, those countries have to experience  significant growth in jobs related to this age group and in the future, the impact of elderly illness will be reduced. This essay will discuss the current and forthcoming impacts in more detail.

In the current time, as the figure of youngest age group increased the jobs related to this population increased as well. This is because  there is a huge demand for many services to serve this group. For example, when there were more than 15 million children in Egypt in the 1980s, the figure of teachers either in schools or kindergarten was increased by 50% according to the Egyptian government. Without an increase in the number of teachers, there were children with no education chance. Therefore, many jobs have been created as a consequence of the ever-increasing proportion of  people aged  15 or younger. 

In the future, as more population who are younger than 15 years, the impact of elderly diseases will be eliminated. Because, the elderly people proportion will the smallest. In Nigeria, for instance, there is a study that expects the rate of back diseases will be less than 10% in 2030 according to a London university study. Without this trend, the reduction in the rate of older people illness will be not possible. Therefore, in the next years, there will be a reduction in the rate of elderly age group diseases as a result of increasing young people proportion. 

In conclusion, some countries have to ever increase the youngest group portion. I believe this trend has to raise the number of professions related to this group and in the  future is expected to reduce the level of elderly illness.",9,8.0
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In the present day with the advance of globalization, many couples prefer to have children at older ages which demonstrating responsibility and awareness about the raising of children. Once the choice in having daughters and sons is a decision extremely serious which requires attention and dedication, people need time to think with serenity. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this decision and which of both have more outweigh.

On the one hand, some people would rather build a family before of mature age and this decision can have impacts on their future. Having more disposition due to young age and the wish in wanting many kids can be reasons to a young couple choose to build a family with less year. For instance, if a woman wants to have three or maybe four children, she will need to prepare for pregnancy as soon as possible once the woman depends on the number of healthy ovules to came true her dream. But this motivation nowadays is not almost considered an advantage whereas there are many concerns about the kids, such as education, health, security. 

On the other hand, some individuals believe that is more vital to make a career, save money and enjoy life travelling and only after that thinking in a son; therefore, some couples wait more time to pregnancy. In addition, a child requires not only moments with quality but also dedication and patience, requirements which in turn happen after a long time, because of these reasons choosing to have a child with older ages is a better option in this case. For example, a mature couple has more responsibility and knowledge to raise an amazing person. The more chance to think about a serious choice, the better the will result be. Considering these motivations, the advantages in choosing to have a child being a more experienced adult are much wiser than the disadvantages.

In conclusion, having a family has both upsides and downsides so that requires dedication and also time; thus, women and men need to think seriously about this topic before any choice. This essay argued the positive and the negative sides of the previous assumption and concluded that the advantages of this topic outweigh the disadvantages.",8,7.5
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Nowadays, with the changes in social media content, individuals' awareness of health has changed. The number of people who eat a healthy diet and do exercise is increasing. I will discuss the reasons for this trend and action that our society can encourage people to be healthier.

One of the reasons why more people choose healthy food to eat is that people prevent diseases. Since many TV programs feature the correlation between healthy food and people’s physical problems. For example, consuming too much salt and fat causes some lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In addition, more people work out since they admire famous people who have healthy figures. Thanks to social media, individuals can see tons of posts in which celebrities share the way of exercise and image and videos of their firm bodies on their accounts, desiring to be like them and willing to exercise.

In order to promote healthy eating habits more, governments should decrease the cost of wholesome food such as vegetables and fruits. The more people regardless of their income can purchase healthy food, the more people become healthier because a more wide range of people can eat this food. Furthermore, to make people more exercise, companies should launch free fitness programs for their employees. Firms can collaborate with local gyms or establish training rooms inside of the companies. If workers can access these fitness facilities, it boosts opportunities for them to work out.

In conclusion, the trend of an increase of the number of people who eat healthy food and exercise regularly comes from obtaining information about a healthy diet from TV and admiration to healthful well-known people, and governments and companies can encourage this situation by introducing the low cost of healthy food and free fitness centers.",7,7.0
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In this contemporary epoch, whilst proponents hold the view that rich countries cannot make their citizens pleased easily and they are not in a nice position, I am of the belief that the public feels pleased with any increase in their country as they have their right in equally way. My convention will be explained. 

On the one hand, despite disagreeing that people do not get satisfied as they have everything, some advocates believe that any growth in salaries or other life materials helps families to live better. This means that when parents get an increase in their salary, they can buy things that they could not afford  earlier. For example, when Brazil planted some beans which returned to  coffee and that made them richer than before and it helped their citizens significantly. Hence, what can be said is that any increase in the means of living, even in a small way,  affects positively  life.

Nevertheless, opponents and I are convinced that any rise in the country can transform families' lives as some big countries have poor people. In other words, when Governments get extra money to spend on institutions like hospitals, parks and schools, they are creating finer life. To illustrate, Switzerland is one of the richest in the world but this did not make its individuals less satisfied with any increase in  salaries as life has become so expensive. Hence, developed peoples know the importance of development and money, and that is what keeps them at the forefront.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the abovementioned points, it can be reiterated that even though some individuals do not feel satisfied with anything, other people already do. Therefore, I am convinced that there anyone feels happy with any the increase.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?","Change is an inevitable factor and it affected almost all areas including education sector. Modern education system mainly promoted aptitude based study rather than the conventional method. As per the opinion of a faction of people, tertiary study is mandatory for the better future of students and others are opposed to this view. As per their argument, students can choose their career after their secondary education. This essay analyses both aspects and state personal opinion.
On the one hand, Most of the professional jobs requires specialisation in their studies like doctor, architect and so on. So students need to take graduation and specialisation in that fields. In global view, companies recruiting candidates on the basis of their graduation. So in order to get lucrative job, students would prefer college study. In addition to that, each and every educational qualification increases the knowledge level of a person. As higher as someone study, his knowledge increases that much as well. 
On the other hand, some students who prefer vocational education in secondary schools and they choose to work immediately after their studies. Early joining of school leavers in jobs give a chance to expert in that job compared to graduates. Moreover, if students start to work in in their young age, they will manage the money wisely. Most of the skilled labourers are only completed their education and started their work immediately.
To recapitulate, graduates and secondary school leavers are useful to the society in one way or another. Professional jobs demands and specialisation in the field and skilled job fields accommodate vocational school leavers. Students should choose the level of education based on their passion and preference.",1,4.0
"Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people opine that the historical artefacts should be returned to the country of origin which were captured during wars or colonialization while others argue that it should remain where it is right now.  I agree with the former view and this essay will discuss the reasons in brief.

Firstly, many people have sentiments and emotions attached to the objects which were taken away from their country in the past. Besides, this also exhibits the nation history and cultural values. For example, during the British rule in India, the idol of Lord Vishnu was stolen from the temple and is now being displayed in a museum of London. Many people believe that the ideal place of the statue should be the temple from where it was stolen rather than a museum. Due to this many Indian citizens are putting pressure on the government to bring those items back.

Secondly, these items can be used as a remedy for building and improving the relationship between the two countries. Also, it helps to bring peace and harmony between them. For example, when the ties between France and Egypt were not at their best, Prime minister of France decided to return mummies which were captured during World War I to Egypt in order to normalise their relationship. Due to this gesture of goodwill, bilateral talks resumed between these two sovereign states after a decade.  

To conclude, bringing back the historical artefacts not only boost the relationship between states but also brings happiness in the society as many sentiments and culture values are attached to it.",10,8.5
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do  you agree or disagree?","Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to  hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the  idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.  On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a  competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any association should be to cover its  running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of  these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to  remain successful. If a firm is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of  customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words,  a company can only make a positive contribution to the community if it is in good financial health.  On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profit; they  have a wider role to play in the community. One social obligation that owners and managers have is  to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a  “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that  businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental  projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimize their tax payments by  using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to public through the tax system.  In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social  responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.",4,5.5
"some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In a number of nations, an increasing number of people have growing interest in figuring out the past stories of the apartment or flat they dwell in. There are multiple reasons to this and various ways for people to study this. 

There are a number of reasons as to why people want to learn more about the history of the house or building they live in. Firstly, some houses are not so safe and have witnessed accidents, so the dwellers want to know about the reason. For example, one of a neighboring building of our living compound had a water logging incident and the owner asked about the building history of the apartment. Secondly, people want to know the story behind the names of the living quarter so as to better introduce to the guests who come to visit or the prospective buyers who want to buy their house. Thirdly, people want to instill a sense of pride into their children or family members living inside by telling them beautiful stories about it.

Multiple measures can be taken to find out about the house history. On the one hand, you can contact the butler because he or she is the responsible person of your building and must know about it. What's more, you can get in touch with the real estate company which sold the house to you in the first place and they must know about the construction company name and maintenance staff info. Besides, you can look for introduction videos from the house official website or social media. For example, one of my neighbor uploaded the video to tiktok introducing our living community containing the location, neighboring facilities, history and potential.

In conclusion, different people have different reasons for learning about the history of their house and they can take plenty of actions to do so.",3,5.0
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages","Education is the fundamental building block for children’s development. With the growth of technology, people have adopted different types of ways to educate their children. Some people prefer to teach their kids at home . However，others think that attending students to the school department is a better choice. I believe that the merits of schooling outweigh the drawbacks.

    On the one hand, Home-schooling can teach children with free time. Parents could adjust the speed of learning progress through their children performance. For example, when kids are good at certain subjects, their parents could consider that they can accelerate this schedule of the subjects or put less time into this area in order to learn weaker points. Therefore, they would spend time effectively and get an average excellent score. In addition, home-teaching is more suitable for the kids who are not mentally strong, thus this way could protect them far away from bullying at school.

    On the other hand, schooling is an important element for the growth of students.  These kinds of educational systems teach children how to cooperate with others and communicate with their classmates. This is because communication and managerial skills are essential at work in the future. Moreover, there are a variety of students in the institutions and every class is a collectivity. Therefore, children would know that they should help each other and share items with their classmates and friends. Finally, education institutions could provide  advanced resources and  well-trained teachers. So they could have a better education at the academy.

   In conclusion, it can be seen that both  viewpoints have their own merits. But I think sending offspring to university is more beneficial than  home-schooling. This is because school can help socialise children.",7,7.0
"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In a number of countries, educating the youth is predominant. However, some people think that the elderly who are illiterate should have a higher priority in receiving an education and more resources should be allocated to governments. I totally disagree with this statement and I believe that educating the youth should be prioritized. This essay will discuss this point of view in greater detail.

The youth should be given a higher priority in education since they represent the future of a country. A majority of countries prefer to invest in youth by allocating more money and resources, therefore providing more opportunities for them to improve their skills. Since the younger generation will replace the older ones, taking over their jobs and duties, the quality of knowledge will play a vital part in developing a country. For instance, in Kazakhstan, the government provides scholarships for students who demonstrate aptitude for studying. After graduating from the universities, students are obligated to work in the country for three years, thus paying taxes and otherwise taking part in the advancement of the nation.

Another reason behind the fact that the elderly are less favoured in being provided education is their natural tendency to perceive information at a slower pace. It is a scientifically proven fact that, as people age, they can lose their ability to receive information effectively. This is the reason why providing opportunities for the elderly to educate is deemed ineffective by governments. This also explains the tendency of different companies to populate their workplaces with younger specialists.

To conclude, providing education for the younger generation must have a higher priority. This is because the youth is seen as successors of a nation since they will continue working for the benefit of their societies as well as being more able to receive information effectively. Considering all the above, governments should put more effort in educating their young.",7,7.0
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Spacious public spaces such as parks and squares are required for all towns and cities to have. I stand with this perspective and from this essay i will explain the reason with supporting opinion.

Squares and parks are necessary to have in every cities and sould in a big size. This place could give several benefits for nature and society. Most of the cities are full of concentrate building, therefore parks or squares is important space for trees or small forest in the middle of the city. The existence of forest is to absorb carbon dioxide that produced by human activity. For instance, smoke from burnt fossil fuel cars can be captured by the trees. Thus the trees could process the photosyntesis to make an oxygen and give a fresh air. 

Regarding the benefit for the society, parks and squares could provide spaces for entertaiment or to relax. Living in a city sometimes can be bored and leads to stress, because of the traffic congestion or pressure from work. Hence, parks or squares are needed for citizen to enjoy their time and breath some fresh air. Many activities can be done here, such as yoga, picnic, jogging, or just strolling around to enjoy weekend. As a result, this places could help people to achieve their work-life-balance without should going a long ride to coutryside. To illustrate, many activities are held in parks on the weekend such as aerobic or zumba to encourage healty lifestyle and better health.

In conclusion, a large park or square brings several benefits to both nature and society. Therefore, I remain convinced that this idea should be maintained.",2,4.5
"Experts believe that, over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. 
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Science is moving forward faster than most people can process. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence are a few of the fields that stands out the most, because it can ease the day to day. We could say that Part of a country development can be measure through their technological advances and how it directly affect soceity. 

An advantage that stands out of having robots doing human's jobs is the precision level a field can achieve with its tasks on a daily basis. For instance, medical procedures done with a lasers, which would be thousands of times more precise than an expert doctor's hand. Also on an industrial level, cutting and assambling machines has been optimized by other machines and robots. Another advantage would be the improvement in the time frame to produce goods or deliver tasks, As it has being with car production. For example Ford is known to be the first car company to introduce the assambly line to their production, making it the first company in the USA to produce more cars in less time.

Moving aside all the good it could bring, we must also put in a scale the human capital being compromised due to big industries not needing their skills anymore. Nowadays doing the job of houndreds of people excaving we have very impressive machinery that can do the same job being operated just by one persone in lesser time.  In the other hand, one of the fears of humanity is that Artificial Intelligence could achieve a level of development that might take decisions of its own and reveal against humans.

In conclusion, among all the good things robotics, Artificial Intelligence and technology can bring, we must establish a clear path and goal for our future, so we can combine both human and robots working together, value human capital and work with precision and on time.",3,5.0
"Nowadays, families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are several reasons why people want to going abroad. Some of these are but not limited are 
Job opportunities, comfortable life and learning new cultures. 

Firstly, one of the reasons, why they choose live in other countries is job opportunities. For instance, there is no easy way find job in a country which in middle-east. In addition to that, even  Professionals find a something for make Money, they probably could not. Employers do not give enogh Money for employee. On the other hand, humans would find job without university education  due to the fact that body strong is vital for building industries. 
Secondly, another  reason why people consider about going overseas contries is comfortable life. To give an example, if there are very much political sentetive in your country and you do not like to politics, you should move on to countries which is embrace to immigrates. Moreover, if u allinated to your living place, you cannot live in there anymore.  In spite of everything, you would not feel safety in foreign langeuage spoken countries.
Lastly, the other reason why a person  wants to move to a country which has diffrent culters is learning new cultures. By way of illustration, a person  cannot pick his or her hometown. He or she would be in unusual  ideas for his or her country. It like this, a girl could be an atheist in her hometown but if her relatives are bigot, she cannot feel comfortable in muslim cities.

In conclusion, People want to go abroad for these reasons, altough there are a few diffucult sides.",1,4.0
"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate whether it is crucial to do research into family background or emphasizing on the present and the future is of significance. While each has its own merits, I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned factors.

Without a shadow of a doubt, it is vital to investigate family trees that could enhance people’s knowledge of their past culture. To be specific, knowing abt traditional habits allows people to have a good understanding of their own identity and preserve it through all generations. For example, on Tet holiday in Vietnam, everyone will pay respect to their own ancestors by offering incense on the first day of the Lunar new year, which is a cultural tradition that Vietnamese people have followed for a long period of time. Hence, the study of history is of necessity since it could help to make an all-rounded community by providing everyone an understanding of their culture.

While the importance of studying the history of family is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if focusing on the younger generations is ignored. To be particular, the offspring are the one that will follow and represent ancestors’ footsteps in the future. For instance, one of the most famous families in Thailand has owned various lucrative businesses and estates for more than 50 years. In fact, they relentlessly continue the plans and become more and more wealthy because the working styles of their ancestors are adapted and imitated by the youth. Hence, concentrating on the younger generations is also imperative since they will carry the whole family’s career in the future.

To sum up, although looking back to family background plays a paramount important role in providing cultural tradition for everyone, laying stress on the young is of essence as they will carry the future career of a family.",4,5.5

"Some people say that public sports facilities improve people health problems. Others argue that this development has insignificant effects on public health.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","There is a contentious controversial argument today over whether to use public sports facilities or not . In societies, there is a topic about facilities which are used for sports activity and some public believe that these products are not useful while other groups think using these facilities can help them keep themselves on shape. In this essay, I am going to talk about this issue and give my own opinion.

       The main reason why citizens like these sport facilities, because they can sport whenever they want without paying money .Moreover, they can do sport in their free time . For example, they can sport before they want to go to their job or even at night , so it can have lots of effect on their health.

         Another group do not support these amenities,since they believe these products are wasting money because some of them are not designed by professionals ,therefore, people can find physical problems by using them . Furthermore, these instruments may not be hygienic ,as all the citizens can touch them and use them and in this way, some diseases can become epidemic in the society . For instance, in the Corona pandemic, all the parks or public places were closed to reduce the connection of people .

          In conclusion, although governments try to increase the facilities of society to provide more convenience for citizens , in my opinion , producing sports instruments can be harmful to the public and they should use them with professional coaches.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that celebrities have a positive effect on society, while others think that their effect is harmful and negative. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","At present, whilst opponents hold the view that some influencers have detrimental effects on the community, proponents have a diverse perspective. However, I am a staunch believer that some entertainers positively affect the youth because their deeds are inspiring and appropriate.

On the one hand, a category of individuals believe that singers, actors, or football players have detrimental effects on the community, and they do not have a prominent role in society compared to other vocations.  In other words, if teachers who educate a myriad of  generations or doctors who put at least ten years of their lives in hectic study and saving people's lives are followed and imitated by juveniles, they will help their society more than famous figures who  pread violence, erroneous thoughts and immoral behaviors. For instance, the superstar Mohamed Ramadan"" receives millions of pounds for presenting violent content that diffuses atrocities, promotes smoking, or even encourages drinking alcoholic beverages. Thus, what can be said is that these enormous earnings received by errant entertainers provoke workers in other hard-working professions.

On the other hand, some celebrities are worthy of being praised because they have an indispensable role. To illustrate, when some glamorous characters generously contribute to philanthropic associations by making monetary donations towards health facilities and when they launch awareness campaigns, they constructively influence adolescents. This can be exemplified by the Egyptian footballer ""Mohamed Salah"" who encouraged a plethora of young people to combat addiction by the anti-drug campaign that he initiated. Therefore, not only do these luminaries deserve massive funds, but they also should be honored by appreciation awards as it becomes lucid that some megastars can rebuild morals in the world.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the points mentioned above, it can be reiterated that some influencers inspire and admonish the youth and caution them against crooked practices. I am convinced that exemplary public figures who are of high repute are worthy of being well-paid.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that the goverment sholud take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their retirement.
What is your opinion? Is it a postive or negative development?","In this fast changing world era, every age-group need certain facilities for their survival. Although half the population believes that people should get government support after retirement,on the contrary, feels that they want everyone to save money for their future while they are working.I will shine on both sides. In my opinion, taking care of old people is important for society and government.


To accompany, there are many reasons why some people consider against providing facilities such as financial help to retirees. First, the government can introduce more development projects that help improve the economy and development of the country rather than giving people beneficial services after retirement. For example, the latest studies prove that many nations ban facilities after retirement and focus more on developing valuable public projects. In addition, it is seen that sometimes relatives or others cheat on retired people to get money for their service. This is why some people may not get these benefits


On the contrary, nowadays, due to more competition in every field, survival has become relatively difficult. First and foremost, after a certain age, people lose their physical strength and are unable to do labor work such as working as a laborer in factories and drivers etc. Therefore, in this situation they need financial support for basic needs of home, shoes, clothes and food etc.Additionally, in today's world, there are some sons and daughters who leave their parents alone, the government needs to build more old age homes where they get proper basic needs and care. Even the rapidly increasing cost of living and food items adversely affects older people who do not have sufficient savings.


To demolish the whole notion, I gather that retired people contributed their lives for the development of society. Therefore, after retirement, it is the duty of society and government to take care of these people and ensure their better survival.",5,6.0

Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"Undoubtedly,  globalization has surged the interaction among the nations which result in better income in technology, medicine and education. In this regard, there is a highly controversial issue among people that international growth brings tremendous benefits to countries, whereas others reckon that it can lead to forgetting the culture. As far as I am concerned, all people around the world have the same rights and dignity so it is essential that governments provide interactions with other countries. Here,  both views will be discussed.

From one point of view, cultures are part of human beings' identity which require to be protected strictly. Unfortunately, by developing science and technology more and more people have forgotten some national cultures like celebrating the feasts, thanksgiving or even the importance of Christmas day. Also, some cultures, especially in developing countries, have been driven from developed countries. For example, Halloween was not popular in Islamic countries though ,by emerging social media, many youngsters celebrate this day by wearing different costumes. Therefore, parents and teachers play an important role by reminding the value of culture to children .

From another point of view, globalization makes the world to be connected to each other. As a consequence, students can have a chance to communicate with other educators from all around the world. For instance, student exchange has become mainstream which can give an opportunity to students to go abroad for a year to continue their education and get known other nationalities. Plus, businesses have shown great financial advantages by expanding their branches to other companies. Also, the rate of employment is significantly increased by constructing the organizations in developing nations that contribute to a better economy.

To put it in a nutshell, by respecting to whole views mentioned above, it is not acceptable to ignore  globalization to protect  cultural identities. In this regard, governments should allocate huge amounts of money to raise  public awareness regarding the value of cultural heritage.",9,8.0
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Online learning is provided at several universities to substitute for traditional classrooms. Despite some drawbacks of this development, I believe they are eclipsed by its advantages.
On the one hand, there are two major drawbacks of distance-learning programs at tertiary education. First, studying via the Internet often lacks face-to-face contact thus hindering students’ learning efficiency. Through online platforms, classroom interaction is rather limited making it hard for students to ask for clarification or receive direct feedbacks from teachers. This, therefore, leads to their low level of lesson’s comprehension. Second, attending e-learning courses requires considerable discipline from learners. Students who tend to procrastinate or struggle with work-life balance may fail to complete the course’s requirements.
On the other hand, I believe that the values are more significant than such disadvantages. To begin with, web-based classes offers learners considerable flexibility in terms of learning pace. With technological devices such as smartphones and laptops, students are able to engage themselves in self-paced studying, which means that they are allowed to study at their personal speed and level. Unlike traditional learning, this new method enables learners to focus on areas they need to improve rather than following the same path as other peers. Another benefit of virtual classes is that they are suitable for students from various backgrounds thanks to their accessibility. For instance, learners with restricted mobility such as physical handicaps or injuries are likely to opt for this form of learning as they have great difficulties in commuting to schools. For those who come from remote areas or stay far away from school campuses, learning through the Internet is highly favorable.
In conclusion, it seems to me that the merits of online learning programs at higher education systems are notable than its downsides.",4,5.5
The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, English is commonly demonstrating its' efficiency for the understanding of knowledge in variety of fields, such as economy, biology, psychology, politic and an abundance in opportunity for jobs and employments. Human with their awareness, cognition reveal that the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. I agree with this statement. Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language. Moreover, English is a both logical and basic international language, throughout years of developing, English with its' improvements in meanings and pronunciations, is recognized as a familiarity to everyone, it is gradually becoming easier and not too complicated for people to learn, as a result, English can expedite the problem of language barrier and easily becomes a global language. Furthermore, English as an international language with its' ease and uncomplicated structures can get people the opportunity to get themselves their employment, since English is already known as a popularity in ways of interacting with languages, verbal communication, if English can be spreaded, it can cure the problems of unemployment and a lack of work force.

Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, universities are accepting all the students, as many men as women in every subject matter. I believe that being open to all students is fair. The university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual, regardless of gender.
However, I think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic. Even though, in general, I completely agree that there must be equality and human rights.
Nowadays, many are the organizations created, to support equality, sex discrimination, with the aim of helping people to get their rights. However, despite enormous positive changes compared to the past, still, some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men. What does it even mean? Should a woman only do house chores and raise kids? As can be seen, based on women's experience, a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time. There is an old saying, 'Give me an educated mother and I will give you an educated nation'. Therefore, I disagree with some people's beliefs. Men and women can be great in different jobs and positions.
However, having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities. Realistically speaking, there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other. In terms of numbers, if we think that, for instance, in the nursery degree there is 50 % of females and, then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males, it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students.
In a nutshell, universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Global warming threats our lives in many ways , and it is quite a challenge to deal with rising temperatures that could result from industrialization and deforestation. I totally disagree that we should adopt living with such circumstances . There are two primary reasons for this.

Firstly,ecological degradation should be shunned. This is because we ought to live in a friendly environment , inwhich governments would introduce grass root programme to protect forests and grow new trees as populations are arising in almost every country and this is causing trees to be constantly cut down to provide shelter and also food. Trees are critical due to the fact that they absorb CO2 , and rising levels of CO2 have been linked to higher temperature levels.

Secondly, I believe that climate change need to be avoided ,so we can live in a healthy well-being environment without the detrimental effects . For example, air pollution and lung cancer that could result from industrialization. Nowadays,there is a growth of industrial areas in developing countries. Many nations in Asia and Africa are building more and more factories everyday to meet the demands of their ever increasing populations and for export purposes. Again, government should put guidelines to cut harmful activities such as waste disposal and limit the usage of plastic bags in supermarkets.

In conclusion, it is fallible not to deal with environmental pollution and live with it . In my opinion, Introduce regulations have been generally a positive development to limit the negative effects resulting from such a phenomenon.",3,5.0
"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","With urbanisation, the population in the cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along with it lots of other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as the government can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting the new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding the city.

First and foremost, the government is the only appropriate authority to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are the cities on an island, they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to have the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation government can extend highways to help commuters access the city easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve the accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding the cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of the city. In the Noida, for instance,  a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of the city and built metros and highways for commuters to make the city easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs  of their citizens.",10,8.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There has been a difference of opinion regarding the merits of continuing a higher education as people believe that is better to get a job straight after school. I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university. 
The option to start a work immediately is attractive for several reasons. The access to have an independent lifestyle as long as younger people start earning money, a wider range of possibilities come with it. In this way, they will be able to afford their own apartment or start a new family. In terms of their career, getting a job brings the opportunity to gain experience in specific fields. Indeed, spend time working in a real industry and sharing different points of views with co-workers and bosses, gives an invaluable knowledge about the process.  
Despite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in the majority of professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree. As a result, nowadays a large number of industries and hospitals are only hiring people who have a bachelor degree or higher. Secondly, in recent years, the job market is becoming more competitive and sometimes there are hundred of applicants for one position in a company. Subsequently, young people who do not have a degree will not be able to compete and without a job is more difficult to continue growing in a career. 
By way of conclusion, I believe that students will be more successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.",8,7.5
Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, obesity is increasingly affecting children. As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people.",7,7.0
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing
companies. To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by
advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?","Companies are spending more on marketing than ever before. With increasing competition, businesses are promoting their products aggressively. Therefore, I believe customers are getting influenced immensely. This essay will discuss the consumers' response by these advertisements and some solutions.


Firstly, there is a lot of false information that companies convey about their products. This leads to people believing everything they watch on television or online. The main reason is the cut-throat competition, and to survive they have to sell their products, no matter what. Agencies usually hire already popular celebrities, to gain everybody's trust. For instance, to promote health supplements, athletes are chosen, the customer starts connecting the healthy lifestyle and fitness of that sportsmen with the supplement. One possible solution to the problem can be, celebrities should research all about the brand before endorsing. It will ensure the audience gets the right product.


Secondly, with marketing we end up having more items than we need. Misleading promotions are the main reason behind it. For example, if we ever see a luxury brand commercial, they always focus on rich people's lifestyle. This is because, they want to connect their brand with luxury, which has a little to do with the actual product. I feel, government should monetize these commercials, they should check the product's authenticity first, and any type of online marketing should also be checked.


To conclude, companies will always find loopholes in the system, to exploit it. Unless the government impose strict rules, the problem will only escalate. Also, It should be the responsibility of citizens, to check what to trust because the false information will be there.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that time spent on television and computer games can be valuable for children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been a contentious argument over the effect of watching TV and playing computer games on children. This essay examines both points of view and my perspective, being that these activities can be beneficial if the time spent is in moderation. 

 Some hold a firm belief that watching television and playing games on  computers have various benefits. Firstly, these sources of entertainment can enhance  brain development. By interacting with the world through those technologies, either real or artificial, their brains’ functions including spatial-visual reasoning can be boosted subconsciously. Furthermore, after a heavy workload of studying, students should find a stress reliever to provide an escape from information overload, therefore, those kinds of entertainment can be extremely suitable for these situations. 

 However, others raise voices of disapproval by stating that those leisure activities can have a negative influence on their children. This is because of the excessive amount of time spent on playing video games, which eventually leads to addiction. Nowadays the advancement of these sources of vast media has been to the extent that once young and impressional people take part in, they will grow an instant interest, henceforth, it is hard to stop to do other work such as dealing with homework or reviewing the lessons. To illustrate, a single episode of a popular drama film tends to last 1 hour, let alone a whole season; whereas ,in contrast, students only have few hours to both relax and prepare for the next school day.

 To conclude, both sides have their own merits. However, from my ,perspective I am inclined to the opinion that playing computer games and watching TV has great advantages for the youngsters as long as time is spent moderately.",9,8.0
"Studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released.","Misconception and lack of research about the criminal world have been revolving in our society for decades. People, today are convinced that the offenders who have been imprisoned for their misdeed have a scope to reinvent themselves in the community by giving them a chance to educating them in the prison which will benefit them to obtain a job once they are out; in turn reducing the number of crimes in the society. I disagree that limited or no education may cause a person to be a criminal and believe that it has nothing to do with the knowledge gained from schooling or at-home education.

Although I disagree that education has nothing to do with the decrease in the number of crimes, I see why some people may think that it is essential for them along with  society. Firstly, it would be due to misconceptions they have that only non-educated people commit transgression. To illustrate this, doctors with a doctorate degree have a personality that they would never commit any offence where they portray to be well mannered as well as have good morals and ethics.  Secondly, people believe that offenders do wrong deeds because of a lack of money for their survival. For instance, a person from a underprivileged background are often uneducated as non of their family members can pay for education which leads to no job and later poverty. To survive one needs food, water and shelter so they think that lack of such amenities causes them to commit a crime. Consequently, people are convinced that education and jobs will help reduce crime in  society.

Research has been proven that it is the state of mind which plays a vital role in being a criminal rather than one’s education. Education is not the answer for solving crime in  society; however, one needs to be mindfully stable. Despite, doctors graduating from a renowned university evidence show that there are a number of culprits in the jails for committing crimes like for example, once a doctor was mal-practising in a hospital by selling body organs for a lesser amount. Furthermore, one doesn’t need to be educated to get a job as there are many fields that require skills. For instance, farming in India is usually done by  skilled workers who are un-educated.

I believe that the best way to overcome the crime is to help the criminals by appointing psychologists to treat them by understanding the reason behind such actions together with providing them with essential survival aids.

To conclude, education is not a solution to minimise crime in  society rather providing them with the necessary help will not only make them a better people but will also help them to distinguish right from wrong.",5,6.0
Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what in your opinion should be done about it?,"There is an inclination of students towards university courses, with a future perspective of grabbing a good pay job upon graduation. In reality, many fresh graduates fail to find the type of work they are looking forward to and some may even take up jobs not relevant to their field. This is due to the lack of  real-life job experiences and competitive job market conditions, many university graduates find themselves drifting from their desired career path. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the impractical higher education coursework which needs to be modernized. 

Moreover, the traditional university curriculum focuses on the theoretical aspect that doesn't’ bridge the gap of providing practical knowledge of jobs he/she may be looking for. One popular reason is that university programs are mostly theory-based. This lacks a practical hands-on job experience and basic skills in a candidate. For instance, knowledge of coding is required in IT/ Computers for an Engineering student. Just passing the university exams and getting coding certificates won’t land them a job. Another reason is the viewpoint is rising competition in jobs. Students take up a course without knowing its upcoming job opportunities. Lack of guidance from professors,creates a vague idea about the possible career path.

I believe that there is a solution following “one stone that kills two birds”. Reforming the education system that is feasible by  following a tripartite relationship with Government, universities and the companies. Firstly, companies can mention their requisite skills regarding the type of jobs they are looking for. Secondly, to help students get good placements, universities can design coursework according to the right market fit requirement imparting practical experience in their field. Thirdly, government validation is needed to implement changes in this contemporary structure. This will help to avoid overflowing candidates in the job pool and help them acquire a better fit job in future.

To conclude, the current scenario of the prevailing education prospectus will not change if universities don’t take the necessary steps to make a change. Individuals have to gear up with practicalities of work and challenging market situations.",10,8.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming intrested in finding out about the history of the house or the building that they live in. what are the resason for that? how people can research this?","In this contemporary epoch, a number of families are keen on revealing the past of their current homes. Whilst that can be explained by the need of humans to find out more about their ancestors, it is undeniably a challenging thing to do. In my point of view, I believe that this is to a large extent positive development. Thus, the underlying factors for that as well as my contention will be further explained in this essay.

To embark on, descendants' curiosity has always played a pivotal role in many of the discoveries throughout history, and it remains the principal factor that drives our curious behaviour to find out more about our progenitors and where they lived. In other words, when some individuals come to a new discovery about the indigenous people or the place where they lived, they feel satisfied more  and become eager to learn even more about it. In addition, it can be even lucrative to do that, because historical places tend to be priceless. For example, according to an article published by The Times, historical palaces and villas tend to cost a tremendous amount of money compared to ordinary or modern houses. Hence, it can be observed that the more ancient the building is, and the more we know about its history, the more valuable it becomes.

However, no matter how paramount for organizations and people to find out more about a property, it may not be an easy task to study what actually has happened before. To illustrate, if scientists and individuals want to know to which period the building dates back to, they have to use complicated and expensive scientific methods to do that, and not just rely on historical records. An eminent example of this is the element tracing method that is being used to trace back the exact date when a specific item has been forged or used. It is not only costly progress, but it requires dedicated equipment and well-trained specialists such as anthropologists or historians. As a result, it is  extremely expensive progress to uncover the past of real estate or premises.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the abovementioned points, it can be reiterated that despite the importance and the outcomes of finding out more about the places and landmarks that people have, the amount of expenses required is such an obstacle. Therefore, it is only recommended when the revenue outweigh the costs.",8,7.5
"some people say that to prevent illnesses and diseases, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","No doubt, people’s health is influenced by the environment and housing conditions. That is why some people opine that governments should focus more on the environment and housing to prevent various ailments. While I do admit that these areas require attention, in my opinion, by simply addressing environmental pollution and housing scarcity, we cannot see much of an improvement in public health.

Indeed, environmental pollution and dirty surroundings cause many health problems. For example, air pollution is a major issue in cities and, consequently many urban residents suffer from respiratory ailments. Lack of access to clean water is another problem that millions of people face in poor countries. Unhygienic surroundings are the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and fleas which spread many diseases. Therefore, if the government looks into environmental pollution and provides basic housing amenities, such problems can be avoided to a great extent.

Nevertheless, simply focusing on the environment and housing will not prevent all diseases. The government has to do much more. It has to allocate a portion of its budget to prevent diseases through vaccinations. It should also spend on screening tests through which serious diseases such as cancer can be detected long before actual symptoms occur. In earlier ,stages most cancers are totally curable through inexpensive treatments. Launching health awareness campaigns is another thing governments can do to improve public health. Even if the government provides housing to all, diseases can still spread if people are ignorant and allow stagnant water to collect in their surroundings.

In conclusion, although giving priority to environmental issues and housing will improve public health, a lot more has to be done to eradicate diseases. The government, for example, has to launch health awareness campaigns, provide free vaccinations and regular health checkups to ensure that people live a healthy and long life.",7,7.0
"Some people think that it is a waste of money for countries to host big sporting events like the world cup and that the money would be better spent on other things. However, others think that hosting large sporting events has a clear, positive impact on a country.","There are many individuals who think that hosting giant sporting festivals such as Olympic is a way of wasting the expense and the government should use that money on the other stuff more important than. However, I personally believe that organizing such events bring a host of advantages for a nation. 

There are various compelling reasons why people think the government should not spend a fortune on organizing large festivals that resemble sports. In fact, the events"" requirement of infrastructure makes a substantial investment for host nation to ensure the sufficient availability of traffic and sports venues. Moreover, the lower level of development a  country has, the more enormous investment it needs. Thus, while many priorities like environmental pollution or poor living standard become heated, it seemed that the financial burden for festivals is unnecessary, that was why the Brazil authority received a lot of criticism when it hosted the World Cup in 2014. 

In spite of these arguments, I strongly believe that hosting such events has plenty of benefits influences on a country. Firstly, there are numerous tourists and visitors attend these events to support and lift up the morale of their teams. Local people observe a dramatic rise in the sales of their goods and services.

 Secondly, sports are the sources of entertainment and chirpy for followers, people can get golden opportunities to meet and witness the performance of their favorite stars. Thirdly, international sporting events also popularise a country to the world and thus the potential tourism industry of this country gets benefits from that. 

In conclusion,  it seems to me that there are many positive effects for holding international sporting events although this has some notable drawbacks.",1,4.0
Human activities have led negative effects on plant and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people think that it is of crucial importance to keep both home and workplace tidy and clutterless. I strongly agree with the statement mentioned above, as it helps one in saving time and money. Also, it helps in leaving a long-lasting impression on the people around them.
Keeping things clean and well-organized in both personal and professional lives can help one in keeping track of them. This, in turn, facilitates one in saving time, especially in crunch situations where one needs to act promptly. Morning is an excellent example of such situations when people usually to go to work. Disorganized people spend several minutes in finding essential items like keys, wallet and mobile phone, thereby wasting valuable time. In many cases, the items are never found, leading to further frustration, as it results in the loss of money, apart from time.
In addition, keeping things tidy and clutter-free at both home and in the office provides one with a chance of leaving a long-lasting impression on others. The qualities, as mentioned earlier, are always linked to one’s personality, which is continuously being judged by others.   Neighbors and workplace colleagues always feel attracted to one that keeps their personal belongings clean and in an orderly fashion. Based on such good qualities, one might be able to establish good terms with the surrounding neighbors or with bosses, eventually helping them succeed in both personal and professional lives.
In conclusion, keeping belongings organized and neat saves one time and money. Besides, it also opens new doors for one to establish better relationships in both personal and professional capacities.",5,6.0

It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","Study is key of better future while, some people think that higher study is required to achieve a successful career. Although, others believe that it is better way to get a job after completing school. I will discuss both points of view and give my opinion in ensuing paragraphs. 

To being with, there are some reasons for studying at university or college is is best path of successful career. The school teach basic level of subjects. While, in the college and university teach advanced level of perticular subject. So, after completing degree student have vast knowledge of their field. For example, if students get job after diploma they do not have enough knowledge of socially. Such as, how to deal with other people and how to convince about their products or anything else. Whereas, the student get job after degree,they have knowledge in every field. Moreover, nowadays compitition has been increased so students have less skills or knowledge companies do not pay higher.

On the other hand, the student who get the job after school will be ceret some problem when companies give promotion because they do not have any idea to managing team and deal with people. For instance, the survey of times of India shows that the number of children join job after school but they can not apply for higher studies in college and university. As a results, in the near future people have not good education in our country.

In conclusion, the study is most important part of our life when people believe that if children better future and good opportunity they have to enough education and vaild degree. While, others think study is not useful for good job so, thay say that it is better to get a job after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Robots have been making our lives so much easier , hence some people think they might not be good for our future or even hurt us in some ways. I strongly disagree with this statement. 

these days robots have many benefits for human lives for example there are bots that help us heal our mental health , choose things that suit us the best ,learn new things with their help ,or even answer all our questions and do many of the tasks that before them they would take a lot of time and energy from us , for instance chat gpt is a bot that can solve many of your problems and you can ask any question that you want and in some way it will give you the best answers and make you save more time. 

another thing that leads us to have these negative mindsets toward robots is the effect of fictional movies, series , books etc ,that displayed robots as villains or creatures who destroy humans take control of the world and start to do evil things for example there is a series called west world which the story is exactly about how bad robots can be .while us humans should be more thoughtful and see the positive effects of these equipment on our world.

"It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.
In conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",7,7.0
It is argued that the parents of children who break the rules should be punished in some ways as parents are responsible for the children's actions. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals frequently put the blame for juvenile delinquency on their parents. Nevertheless, from my perspective, exerting discipline on parents for their children’s wrongdoings is not sensible because every individual is responsible for their own actions.

It is undeniable that mothers and fathers must take accountability for their children’s malpractice since they are role models for their offspring from the earliest days of their lives. It could be true that juveniles’ misbehaviours, which violate the law, may stem from the observation of their parents. And since adolescents are acutely sensitive, they can be affected straightforwardly. For example, if parents are offenders who cheat others for money, their children would suppose it as normal and consequently commit the same crime in possible cases in the future.

Despite the aforementioned arguments, I hold the belief that should not be imposed punishments on their parents when their offspring commit an offence. The first reason can be attributed to individuals’ responsibility for their actions. And each person is a separate individual engaging in a myriad of activities. Hence, it is morally wrong and may foster resentment and ill will toward innocent individuals. Another point worth mentioning is that adolescents are influenced by not only their parents but also other factors such as their peers or anti-social content on the Internet. Frequent exposure to toxic friends at school or violent topics on social media, for example, will be a key factor in illicit behaviours, which could be the potential root of crime-committing activities. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that other parties should share responsibility for children who break the law.

In conclusion, although parents will be at the core of setting examples for their offspring, I am of the opinion that it is unreasonable to accuse them of their children’s dirty deeds because of individual liability for their actions and other influential parties.",9,8.0
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","Nowadays, many couples are willing to prepare pregnancy not the same ages as the old days. In the following paragraphs, there are several reasons to examine this situation in depth. In addition, there are influences might be happened to the families.

The main reason for postponing pregnancy is that most of people get married later than before. In the past, adults got married at the ages of 25, and it was quite late if you hadn't had a huslabel or a wife until 30 years old. Take my friend Jane, for example, she married my father while she was 32 years old, while her sisters all had huslabels at the ages of 23. However, in the society now civilian are ready to have a family after 30. Therefore, they may pregnant around 35, which is 10 years later than our parents' generation. Besides, young couples now more care about their careers than pregnancy. Some of them said, they haven't prepared to take the responsibilities to be parents. 

Nonetheless, the advantages for being parents later than before is that the baby is expected for the family. Furthermore, the family has abilities to handle the expenses. Therefore, the children could have a better growing environment. By contrast, the disadvantages are the dangers for the mature women pregnant. Moreover, it is a challenge for older adults to take care babies as well, which needs healthy and strong bodies. 

To conclude, there is not to say that having kids in their later ages is totally without merit. Nevertheless, the parents need to take the challenges and well prepared their health for their energetic children.",7,7.0

But, someone needs to program with correct instructions in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decisions because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence. Moreover, these devices should be designed by someone, always those tasks are done by human beings. For instance, a robot can instruct to repair a car, yet it could not instruct to design a car. Because that needs a higher level of intelligence. Another common fact is that robots cannot process empathy. As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors who need social skills.

Nonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour works do not need much of brain power. Those work only needs to repeat some actions. Hence, those types of work will be done by robots in the future. As a result, people should move away from work that only needs physical strength and learn the work require metal skills. 

To sum up, although some jobs are taken over by robots, these electronic and mechanical devices will not be able to take over the occupations that need empathy and higher intelligence levels.",5,6.0
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In this modern world, there is a new tendency to have children in the family  later. While some believe that this contention has more benefits than demerits, others have different beliefs. This essay will discuss  both advantages and disadvantages and which of both has more outweigh.

Having infants at older age depend on the couple's decision. Most of the time, individuals  tend to have a successful career in their early stages of life, and then at ,later they can afford a financially stable life for their children. In order to give a quality life to their successors, it is important to have a stress-free family background. When couples become mature over  time, it is rare to have family break-ups and inter-family conflicts. One of the latest research revealed, that, in the USA, Couples who work in the IT industry tend to have their children when they are around 35-40 years old. That report clearly shows that  with all the considerable data those parents are the best to raise  healthy and well-mannered offspring.

Although the aforementioned positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, with  time, both men and women have genetic degradation which can directly have an impact on a child's genetic defects such as Down's Syndrome and Autism. Although, these elders  lack the strength to play with their youngsters, as they have more energy compared to their parents. As an example, if parents are in their 60s, it is difficult to work and understand infants who are in their 20s. The generation gap is the most dangerous factor that can destroy the bond of a family.

In sum, given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of having children at older ages, it is reasonable to conclude that, it is more beneficial to conceive offspring at an early stage of life.",7,7.0
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"There is no doubt that online education has become a new learning trend. However, while I agree that they also have negative aspects, still I believe that this advanced technology is mainly beneficial to  individuals. In this essay, I will  support my view with examples.

 During the coronavirus pandemic, offline schooling became more challenging. The universities had to start web-based classes, in order to stop coronavirus from affecting the younger generation's health. In initial studies, it was declared that this virus is more dangerous to the youth. In such a situation, it was difficult to continue the academic system without wasting kids studies and maintaining their health. At that time, virtual tuitions were only the possible option that can save school learner's years and well-being simultaneously. due to this solution, the youngsters can connect with their teachers and faculty. They can learn new concepts and clear their doubts. Moreover, they can even conduct digital examinations.

Another major advantage of attending  such courses is that it saves time. Nowadays, time plays a crucial role in our life. If a working person wants to pursue a specific program then it may become difficult for him to make a balance between his job and exams, as he also needs to travel to his university to attend the classes. As a consequence, it becomes hard to concentrate on both the tasks and he may lose his focus and leads to mental pressure. While applying for such alternatives, it can save his travelling time and he can also utilize his travelling  time in learning. In recent years, there are many applications are available in the market and with their ,help you can select your stream. One such example is the Upgrade application. 

In conclusion, despite there are few reasons why we should value offline education, I'm inclined to consider that the pros of online education outnumber the cons.",8,7.5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while other thing it is a waste of time discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Art is an important culture in the world. Art promotes an understanding and appreciation of the uniqueness of our different cultures, stories, experiences and personal perspectives. This is the focus of debate, and there are two reasons  it behind. The first reason is that children think art is a most important subject . The second is that children are affected by their impeded learning. In this essay, the possible reasons behind and measures of my views on the following points.

The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that people think art is basically subject for kids in school.In  art education, while children are growing up  art is shouldn't without in their life. Art provides people with an enhanced awareness of our diverse culture in the world. By contrast, destroying the children's time is the other problem. It would be a busy learning environment in Hong Kong. Toughen schedules, and massive homework both torture  children every day.

However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off if don’t take the subject of art in the children's school life. Children may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an art academic environment. In the fact, they are only learning  the main subjects like Chinese, English, and Maths. Children can not establish their self-esteem and raise  their confidence in different fields of the subject. But overall, I think this is less likely today, most of the schools involve the subject of art, and organise a campaign of competition of art, it is overweighed to nothing. 

My view is that children should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Children with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated to pay attention to art , which is the best way to gain a deeper diverse vision of themselves.",5,6.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Architecture is one of the cultural heritage that has to be protected and prevented from being damaged. In recent years, a number of citizens have been becoming become increasingly interested in discovering the history of their houses. In this essay, I will illustrate the underlying reasons for people exploring information about their houses and outline two ways in which the history of their houses can be researched. 

One primary reason is for maintaining the house. Knowing the construction and materials of buildings can help the owner in terms of maintenance. One possible approach would be to ask local residents. They might have been living in the area for ages. Moreover, they have a great deal of information. Admittedly, some messages from local residents; however, there might be the wrong information because of hazy memories. Therefore, people have to find evidence to prove the right history of those buildings.

Another reason why more people are interested in understanding their home’s past is to preserve the heritage of historic buildings. If people own a listed building which is inherited from generation to generation, they would have a responsibility to preserve it and prevent it from being damaged. In addition to the data from family, another way in which people can explore the history of houses is by doing research in the local libraries. Normally, the history of city developments is preserved in the local library. People can find a lot of data including the commencement date of the buildings, builders and historical stories. 

By way of conclusion, asking local residents and doing research in local libraries are possible ways to explore the history of houses. However, the messages which are discovered by word of mouth still need to be verified.",6,6.5
"In cities and towns all over the world the high volume of traffic is a problem. 


What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","A significant increase in traffic is seen with each passing year. No doubt, uncontrollable population rise is one of the main reason of a never ending traffic. In my opinion, this issue can be solved by limiting the vehicle manufacturing and few other measures will be dicussed in this essay.

With the ever increasing population,the public transportation availability is declining which is leading to high raise in traffic. People are now buying more vehicles as compared to past decade. For example, a recent study shows that a family owns more than 2 vehicles on an average in recent years, whereas owning a vehicle in past was a big achievement and it was not so common to have a vehicle.

Facts show that theere is 65 percent hike in the sale of vehicles in last 50 years. To solve this issue, Government can impose restriction on manufacturing companies.

We as a society need to take effective measures so that our planet is saved from the adverse effects of  rise in vehicles conjestion on roads. One way which might be effective, is to impose a limit on number of motors are produced in an year. Another way can be to modify the transportation modes by creating diversions. Finally, humans should be encouraged to use public transport extensively by providing attractive travel plans by government.  All these actions, if put in place ,can definately help in reducing the amount of traffic we have now.

Rising birth rate on our planet is surely causing many issues, traffic is one of them. In my opinion this is an alarming time where we as a society needs to come forward and try to use more public transports as compared to our own cars. In the hope of a better future, we all can give our contribution.",1,4.0
Some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"Investigating the history of the house or building that they live in is becoming more popular among people in some countries. Due to religion  people believe and curiosity about houses being too affordable. Not only do people find information through asking the locals but also through internet searching. 

Some countries believe in ghosts or supernatural things which are related to religions in each country. Also it is linked with the unexpected price of accommodations that are cheaper than the estimated price. The reason is that Buddhism believes in ghosts or untouchable things and  feel them through our senses. Some might concern about the past owners whether they died here at home or somewhere else. If they die at home, their soul might stuck at home and we won't feel a sense of belonging even though we buy houses already according to the Buddhist belief. For example, the Thai population are mainly Buddhist, we don't usually buy a second hand houses because it takes much effort to know about the background of houses. But if we had to stay, we would let the monks or the horoscope to wipe out all ghost so that we feel mentally relaxed and feel a genuine sense of belonging. Also if the houses are too cheap, this will trigger them that there might be something went wrong with these house either someone is murdered or the owner is desperately need for money. There are many reasons why people are focusing on the background of their habitats so that local’s belief and unusual price of stays.

Nowadays, investigating for  information is easy. The Internet is such a convenient way to look for rough information. On the other hand, talking to local and neighbours is the best way to obtain most information because we can ask all the questions we would like to know and the data is from their experiences such as how often   crime happen here, is there anyone ever live here and etc. the questions like this is common among Thai people because we interact with one another all the time, we don't worried of facing each other. Importantly, we like to look after each other’s houses when someone is away. It is clear that spending time talking to locals will gain so much knowledge and the easiest way to do. 

In conclusion, in some nations consider about the background of their stay and like to dig for more information. This essay mentioned  the religion’s belief and people’s curiosity. This essay is also mentioned about getting yourself connect with local people is the most efficient method.",5,6.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In today's modern era, some people argue that students should be allowed to make recommendations and even criticize their teachers.While others think that it could lead to losing discipline and respect in the classroom, I personally believe that it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers.

On the one hand, there are two main reasons why this idea would lead to a lack of respect and discipline. The first reason is that most students are too immature to objectively evaluate their teachers, which would lead to completely emotional evaluations without fairness. For example, teachers normally reprimand and punish naughty students when they stray, but given the chance to evaluate, these students would use it to get back at their teachers. In addition, many students will judge their teachers' work as poor because teachers are strict. The second one is that when there are enormous comments, a classroom would be chaos. Because opinions vary from student to student, it would be impractical to choose a teaching way that can be suitable and satisfy all people.

On the other hand, I believe that making comments to educators is beneficial for education. Firstly, if pupils are allowed to give feedback to their teachers, educators would identify their strengths and weaknesses. This can help them improve their pedagogical skills and have good syllabuses in the future. Secondly, feedback is good for pupils, because it makes them feel fully engaged in their education. In fact, the level of comprehension of them depends on the way teachers implement, not on the content of the lesson. For instance, if students are slow, it might be ineffective for teachers teaching to fast. Therefore, giving feedback can help them completely understand their lessons.

In conclusion, although making comments in classrooms might lead to disrespect, I believe that it brings many advantages outweighing drawbacks for educational quality.",6,6.5
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is said that a considerable amount of local funds should be spent on preventing diseases rather than spending on the cure of patients. I strongly agree with this viewpoint.

 

To begin with, there are many reasons for raising money for averting illnesses. First of all, investing in prevention is a more sustainable approach to health care because it focuses on long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes. In fact, a community which is completely averted might have a low risk of disease and longer life expectancy compared to a group of already ill people who are cured. In addition, spending on treatment for intractable sicknesses often requires a huge sum of money while preventing is usually more effective and always costs lower. For instance, to prevent different types of cancers, people should have a healthy diet and maintain fitness by doing exercises or going to the gym, which are economical activities, while patients faced with cancers have to pay enormous payments to prolong themself.

 

On the other hand, giving money in dealing with diseases might has its own merits. In some situations, investing in treatments for existing illnesses may be necessary to address the immediate needs of patients, rather than long-term prevention strategies. For example, a person who is suffering from pneumonia should be cured immediately instead of giving him a preventative plan. Furthermore, raising money on treatments may not only rescue patients, but also help to find out more effective ways to deal with the disease. By this way, many people who are putting up with intractable illnesses might be cured and enjoy the beautiful life they should have.

In conclusion, while local money should be invested in order to prevent people from diseases, the merits of spending it on therapies of people who are already ill should not be denied.",6,6.5
Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discussed the views and give your opinion.,"Plants and animals species have vital role in ecosystems. We humans cannot survive without plant and animal because they have maintained a balance in our planet Earth.Due  to human selfishness many plants and animals are sacrificed. Some agrues that plants and animals can be still protected now while others contend with the assertion.although its late ,in my view still we can change the scenario by protecting plant and animal species.

To start with, human has always done activities to protect themselves without analysing the fact that plant and animal are also part of out planet. Human activities always had a greater consequences on plant and animal species.But now,we are aware about it so it should be preserved rather than destroyed. We should focus on preserving them by creating awareness,not destroying forests,not always focusing on human satisfaction. Plants always has given so much of favor to humans such as from air to fruits,medicines,herbs,even its roots brances to make products for human purpose but now its time to save them. We have to garden them. 

Global warming has reached its point so we human are now competing with nature if we try to protect them .humans have already destroyed the nature in way possible manner so nature with nuture itself. 
Humans should not try to interfere with nature otherwise the consequences like valcano earthquake might occur. 

To sum up i am with the point that now humans should try to solve the problem by taking effevtive measures such as awareness to protect endangered  Plant and animals species and give them full support as we give support our kids. With all the above reasons mentioned humans should try try to nuture nature's things.",2,4.5
"The number of TV programs is growing day by day. Some people say it is good as it gives people more choices, while others say it affects the quality of TV programs. 
Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Technology is regarded as cradle of various entertainment means. A rapid rise in TV channels has been observed in contemporary times. A section of society argues that it is beneficial as there will be more alternatives, whereas a certain class thinks it hampers the worth of shows. In this essay, I will discuss both the sides of the given argument and will reach to an appropriate conclusion.
A group favours multiple programs primarily because of the range it offers. With increased number, the variety of genre is available which interest individuals. Often, the liking for anything differs from person to person, so everyone can benefit with type of shows they like. To illustrate, Zee TV, a famous Indian entertainment channel, maintained highest TRP for consecutive 5 years as the shows involved categories like crime, food, movies and songs.
On the contrary, there are people who think the value of programs decline if they are in bulk. Foremost, in order to provide multiple shows, there is a compulsion on TV producers. Consequently they come up with any type of show which might not be appealing but just for the sake. For example, currently, people prefer to watch TV only on specific time for a particular show which they like as they do not find every program interesting.
To conclude, although both the sides have their own intrinsic worth, I think having limited but meaningful programs are more appropriate than just having them for the sake of having them. Such programs are meant for the entertainment of individuals, if they do not fulfil that objective then it is of no use.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is true that the question of whether to study at university or get a job straight after school remains a source of controversy in the education field. While a number of people believe that working after graduating high school is better, I would argue that studying at higher education is one of the best routes to a successful career.

On the one hand, getting a job right after graduated high school is a good option. Firstly, not many students have an opportunity to enroll in at the university or college, so that some of them decide to start their career paths straight after school in order to earn income for their personal life. Secondly, many young students are made to work instead of going to school, because their parents assume that going to university is so costly and time wasting. In fact, students can earn more money to support family’s finance when working at factories or industrial areas. 

On the other hand, I believe that studying at university or college is the best route to improve our life quality, not only the career path. One of the most essential reasons for pursuing higher education is to get a qualified degree. A bachelor or master degree from form university  is a good evidence to demonstrate that we have enough knowledges, capacity and academic experience to get a position with a high salary. Another reason is that we can broaden our connection when studying at university. By participating in clubs or student organizations, we are able to meet new friends, making connection with people we want to collaborate with and develop together.

In conclusion, although both views certainly have some validity, it seems to me that it is

better to continue the academic journey at university or college. I believe that we can have a better future from our bachelor degree.",2,4.5
"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find jobs after graduation. Give reasons and make some suggestions.","There are a number of young students who are leaving school with a certification and still can not find a job. This essay will explain on the effects and provide some methods to avoid the unemployee volume.

Education is an essencial program for any type of academic schemes and most of the school were lacking on the physical practice on their courses which cause students would unable to handle when they go into an industry enviorment. For example, live sound music is a typical position to rely on both perspectives which are the academic and physical practice. To become a candidate, he or she has to be able to manage the pre-prodction work that means to order a list of the equimpments and also be aware to operate an audio console. Not many of the employers would provide an opportunity that allowing fresh man to manage the hardware gears while working. So it is obvious young individual are hardly to hunting the jobs these days.

By contrast, if the insititue or any type of the education would provide the physical perform on their procedure that would be easier to connect in the real industry when students leaving the school with the legitable certifications. For instance, learning a course might associate with an organization and the students would received a completion letter once they achieve the program. However, it would be eligible for their professionalism and get the first ticket to go into a company.

In conclusion, learning academic in school could be easier than before but it is hard to predict this generation could be able to go into the real world when they left the university or college. If the education department can implement a contract between the school and company while they are learning that would be improve the connection from the reality.",3,5.0
"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.

Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Nowadays,  organizations consider both educational as well interpersonal skills before deploying an applicant for the available vacancy. This has always been a matter of debate, if their emotional intelligence is as vital as their academic qualification and employers’ opinions, regarding this, vary. I totally see eye to eye with this opinion, and in this essay, I will explain the reason for this belief.

Firstly, human resources are considered  a crucial asset of the organization and their contribution to the progress of a business is undeniable. They represent the organization in front of  society, customers and vendors. Moreover, the growth of a business can be hampered extensively, if the people working with it, do not go well with their coordinators. For example, to crack a deal with a client, an organization does not appoint an employee who is only well qualified but has a great understanding to read the mind of the client and can behave accordingly.

Secondly, when people in the organization go well with each other, they work as a better team to contribute towards its growth. In today’s era, there is no such work that can be done solely; hence, an organization appoints a team to work on a project. If people working as a team do not behave in well-manner with each other, it will create a hostile environment in offices. Additionally, it will create such an organizational and work culture where no one would like to work which will result in frequent resignations by employees. To cite an example, I would mention my own real-life experience of an organization where I worked for just 10 months because of the uncooperative and unfriendly behaviour of my colleagues.

In a nutshell, I would say that along with academic qualification, it is indispensable for  employers to take the social skills of employees into consideration because  business growth is not dependent only on the knowledge that employees possess but also on how well they go with each other and their clients.",9,8.0
"Some people decided to have children in their late age than in the past. Why?
Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","These days, some individuals made decisions to have kids when they are older compared to the past. This is owing to their preoccupation with career pursuits. This essay will argue that the benefits of this trend offset the drawbacks, as older parents are more mature and financially stable to raise children.
An important reason why some people decided to have kids in their late age is because of concerns for their career progress. In other words, some believe believe that children can be a source of distraction when they are at the early stages of their work. For instance, some female doctors in Nigeria delay having their first child until they have been promoted to a senior level. This has resulted in some people bearing children when they are older. Thus, if young professionals are less concern about progression in their career, they would have had kids at a younger age.
One commonly cited disadvantage of people giving birth and raising children at a older age compared to the past is the associated health risks. Maternal and Child morbidity and mortality increase with the age of the parents coupled with the occurrence of genetic abnormalities. For example, Down syndrome and similar problems are common in children of mothers older than 35 years. This risks are reduced when couples have children at a younger age.
Despite this, there are a number of significant advantages of giving birth and raising kids at a older age. First of all, many people are more financially bouyant with increase in age. Thus, they can provide for both the basic needs of their children as well as meet desires like sound education and healthcare for their young ones. This occurs because many older couples are at the senior level or at the peak of their profession. Furthermore, older parents are better able to cope with the stress of raising kids compared to younger couples. This is due to the fact that they are more mature and they worry less on things such as education, cost of living and work stress. This makes them to take proper care of their children.
In conclusion, some couples do not have children until an older age so as to focus on their career. Although they and their kids may be later expose to health problems, many people are more mature to take care of young ones and financially stable in their later years. On the balance, there are more advantages compared to the disadvantages of the decision to have children when a person is older.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that stadying at university or collage is the best route to a successfull career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In my parts of the world, after finishing school, teenagers will have two options that is continue their education or get a job. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after shool, I believe that it is better to go to college or university. This essay, I will discuss that idea. 

Let’t start by looking of the advantages of start work straight. Firstly, young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In the way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford things which they love. For example, my young brother went to work as soon as he finished school, and he purchased a motorbike which loves. Secondly, they will be albe to approach to works sooner, and assist they in the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to the jobs which they have chosen. This may lead to promotions and a successfull career.

On the other hand, I believe there are many benefits of continuing to college or university. Fisrtly, academic qualifications will increase significantly compere to those who did not continue studies after finishing school. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with lower qualifications. In additionally, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, companies usually choose the applicants who graduate university than others.

In conclusion, from the reasons above, even though going to work right after finishing school has many benefits, I personally believe that continuing to study will be much more beneficial.",4,5.5
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"In recent years rather than being well-informed about the details of newly launched products, people are bombarded with all kinds of advertisements. I believe the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers and there are some measures which can protect them.

The increasing prevalence of advertising exerts several detrimental effects on consumers. First, commercials might stimulate people to purchase products that they do not really need. In order to approach prospective customers and create brand awareness, many enterprises tend to exaggerate the quality of their products. As a result, unwary consumers who are swayed by glamorous advertisements are easily tempted to impulsively buy goods that are of little use to them. Second, the rising popularity of advertising can also encourage people to form bad habits. For example, as youngsters are not mature enough to distinguish right from wrong or judge what is suitable within society, they might become addicted to playing video games if they are exposed to commercials promoting those products on a frequent basis.

There are several approaches that should be taken into consideration to protect consumers from the adverse effects of advertising. Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry. Under stringent control, most businesses would be more responsible and truthful in promoting their products whether through online advertisements or commercial advertising on prime-time television. This would enable consumers to choose the most suitable and reliable products with greater trust and confidence. Additionally, consumers should have a thorough plan of what they are going to buy before they shop. By doing this, people will have time to prepare and make a wise decision about what products should be bought, which eventually save a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods.

In conclusion, although the excessive prevalence of advertising brings a lot of disadvantages to consumers, there are several effective approaches to protect consumers from the negative influences of advertising.",8,7.5
The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Other think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"Some people believe that technology is a reason for increasing the gap between the wealthy and the poor while others think that technology is narrowing down the gap between social classes. From my standpoint, it is just right with some devices that really expenses. For the common technology devices, it is not totally right as will now be discussed.

I believe that technology development has helped optimize the price of technology devices and increase the overall living standard. There are many devices and facilities were created based on kinds of technology such as smartphones, housewares, commuting transportations, … so people can get many benefits from using it to improve their quality of life. Additionally, with the development of smart devices, the connection between people is closer. Friends, family members, stakeholders who stay from different locals can easily interact via platforms or video calls to sharing, chatting, video calls. Apparently, technology is playing an important role and getting people together.

On the other hand, opinions think that technology available increase the gap between the wealthy and the poverty, it is not wrong. Many luxuries technological products are super expensive such as hi-end cars, yachts, or private jets; these enhanced devices are treated as an icon of the luxury life and only the high classes people can afford them. This helps shine the owners, giving them confidence and emphasizing their positions in society. Besides that, it is not too important for wealthy people in terms of financial conditions, they are willing to pay a high price to become pioneers to try fabulous new experiences.  The elite classes with their experiences, powerful and business acumen, may invest in this new technology to enhance their business by applying this new technology for mass production, as mentioned above it helps reducing expenses that lower classes easier to approach. 

In conclusion, although technology may increase the gap between the rich and the poor, I keep my optimistic view about technology products marking the transform of living standard.",2,4.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is argued that celebrities are bad examples to young people because they are more well-known as their glamour than for their efforts. I completely agree that these people can have bad images of young people. However, I believe that there are still some famous people act as positive role models. 
On the one hand, some people believe that celebrities only care about their glamorous life. They may have inherited money from their parents or married a famous partner. They appear in the gossip magazines or on the reality TV programmes.  A good example is Paris Hilton. She was born in the affluent family where she can get everything without any efforts. She has been attending a lot of parties and night clubs. The message to adults is that success can achieve easily, and that school work is not necessary.
On the other hand, there are still some celebrities have positive impacts to youngsters. Firstly, these people are well-known because of their accomplishments. For example, actors, musicians and sport starts demonstrate the fact that their success bases on their efforts, concentration and determination. They shall be good examples for youngsters, acting as excellent role models. Secondly, these people also contribute their money to the society. By donation their finance to the charity organizations, they also help our world to have a better life. These models can teach adults, many valuable lessons. 
To sum up, in my opinion, famous people can also have positive and negative, to our communities, particularly young people.",8,7.5
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"the issue of whether public money should be  used for promoting the  style of human’s health has been raising a lot of debates. Some might say that it is important to invest this moneymoney to take care of people's health in order to prevent illness because if too many humans ill, the chance of curing the disease will be low because the doctor can not afford it On the contrary, others insist on the opinion that government should spend it on a strategy to cure citizens who are already ill. Viewing from a general perspective, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

to begin with, protecting human’s health from any kind of ailment must be a first priority as well as the authorities. firstly, improving inhabitants’ quality of life helps to avoid serious consequences which may lead them to death. For example, level up citizens’ health by investing in the agriculture industry to provide clean food for consumers to keep their body from getting chemicals from fertilizers which can destroy the body of humans ,then the population is guaranteed. Secondly, developing a healthy lifestyle by using money to protect the environment is one way to innovate people's lives and prevent them from any respiratory disease. For instance, creating new vehicles which use clean energy like electricity or solar are friendly to the environment that contributes to decreasing emission into the air. Finally, increasing consciousness of citizens about healthy and balanced lifestyle that reduces the costs authorities in supplying costly medicines and do not make them become the burden of society

On the other hand, some of the population think that inhabitants who get diseases such as  cancer need to be saved by new treatment so that the government should spend all money on investigating new ways or drugs to stop cancer substances that are more important than anything else. However, reducing the number of sick people is more necessary because if too many inhabitants illness, the hospital will not be able to treat everyone 

In conclusion, preventing the crowd from getting sick is essential by promoting quality of their life from nourishment to the environment surrounding them to decrease the number of patients which contributes to releasing pressure and burden for medicines and the nation.",8,7.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or colleges is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, it is a popular belief that pursuing higher education is the prime option for an outstanding career. However, others may argue that working right after graduating high school is the better option. This essay will discuss and demonstrate how both views are valid depending on the career choice itself. 

Attending higher education have better chances for success by providing individuals with deeper knowledge on a specific field of study. This means, young adults are being equipped with information that are essential for their chosen career path. Moreover, students gain skills beneficial to their future profession, which are usually not taught during early education because these skills are highly specific. For instance, to become a doctor, one has to go through medical school to be taught on the human anatomy extensively and have hands-on surgery classes. 

On the contrary, diving into the workforce after completing 12 years of school saves time and money for some. In some occupations that require more practical skills, experience is the efficient way to learn. By gaining experience early on, people manage to get ahead on their career progression. Not only that, formal education such as college and university may be a waste of money, especially when their specific needs are not catered. As an illustration, a chef may be better off by working in a restaurant rather than attending university, which mostly do not provide cookery related majors. 

In conclusion, there will be divided opinions on which is more beneficial, to go for higher education or getting a job after high school. As aforementioned, the decision remained to which profession each individual choose to expertise in.",4,5.5
1) The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In our modern era, it is always debated that vehicles are one of the significant aspect to yhe amount of environmental issues, and the best solution of this is the high prices of fuel. To examine this debate, this essay will examine both merits and demerits of it, and give my point of view.

Firstly and foremost, accessable and cheap fuel for transport  makes it approachable for everyone. If the majority of the society will use their own cars the pollution of air will raise in several times. According to the statistics, almost all members of families have personal cars. For example, if the family on the average do have five members the spoil of nature will boom, and enlarge of the prise of fuel for vehicles, might be a good decision for nature. Consequently, the families may use one car for close destinations among the members also, a public transport may be a beneficial choise for financial, health and environmental aspects. For instance, individuals can to economize their money, arrive the destinations on foot after bus stops, and be more attentive to world.

Secondly, the high costs of fuel for transportation have negative sides. People with relatively less salaries will not use personal cars for their comfort. For example, this option leads to tricks for employees who work far from city center and the public transport works poorly. Moreover, the education at school can affects this problem globally, If the students were taught some lessons about world and ecology, how it is of the essence for every lives they would be more mindful to ecology. For instance, schools can provide with some lessons in the fresh air, give basic tasks , take after flowers and trees so forth.

To sum up,  to increase of value for vehicles  makes it available for only some parts of community, and does not have a great influence in this issue. I firmly agree that, educational background have more effect in environmental problems.",3,5.0
Now-a-days people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of the news. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Everybody knows that social media is very important in our life and it is common so much. We can use it for communication,  business or following some news or famous celebrities. Some people want  to keep in touch with each other. İt is sometimes good , and other times it is bad for us owing to some specific results.

first and foremost, you are able to meet some friends on social websites and you can spend a funny time together because we don't have much time to go  outside we can sit at home and we can meet others if you want to speak about cultures or relationships whatever you want, you can talk for everything. For example, many people met new friends and then  get married. You can find your partner on the internet, and you are able to know how is the person's character. İt shows us that it is beneficial for us.

On the other hand, it has many different communities unfortunately some of them are bad. Cheating on social media is very comfortable and you can't understand if they are talking true or lie. you need to be careful so much you can find very bad people. for example, one day a girl met a man on a communication application, they began the relationship and  she loves him. They got a decision to see each other. she went to the meeting place and was shocked because he was not similar to his profile photo. she understood that he used other person's pictures and she went away quickly and felt bad. This example shows us if we use social media we have to be careful.

to sum up, the internet is very common in our life, We need it and we should use it because it makes our life easier. However, we should be careful , especially for children. it is dangerous and no need to it until the age of 18.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In return to people’s devotion during the labour age comes opinion that government should subsidize them after retirement. Nevertheless, many support individuals self-charged to avoid burden to society. Although both views appear reasonable, I honestly believe governors must take care of old people

Those who assert that it is individuals charged to take care of themselves indicate the mitigation of financial burden. In simple words, as the life expectancy escalated gradually, countries with rapidly aging populations must allocate more money and resources to their health care systems. Consequently, this disproportionate amount of money substantially increased the burden on governments' budgets, which resulted in the collapse of existing funding to tackle pressing issues like the housing crisis or disease pandemic. A well-known example includes India, where a surge in welfare and publicly funded programs hinder existing systems from handling the growing prevalence of chronic diseases while also addressing the needs of large and expanding senior populations. 

Nevertheless, a leading cause to deny this argument is the reimbursement for retirees' perseverance during their labor age. Norway's high welfare payments are a salient example of high taxation returns in generous public assistance. At this place, people enrich the national budget by devoting their time and effort to the country's development, meaning that citizens contribute to taxes raised. The authorities can distribute these taxes further to develop their country, such as building hospitals, upgrading infrastructure, and paying for officials. The result is that by way of compensation for old contributors' devotion in their youth, money-related assistance and care services are introduced to the elderly, for example, free-of-charge health checkups or retirements home. It implies that governments’ subsidies provision appears acutely pivotal as recompense for labor’s dedication.

In recapitulation, even though the personal accumulation alleviates the strain on public funding, it cannot disclaim the urge to equipped senior civilians with proper welfare programs in response to their determination. Thus, it is necessary to grant elderly an expense to meet demands on leisure and healthcare systems at their retirements",5,6.0
"As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who can’t afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, the cost of homes is increasing at an alarming rate. The apartments are a  basic necessity for individuals, the governments should give free accommodation for each and everyone who can not bear it. Personally, I completely agree with this standpoint because it benefits both individuals and society as a whole.

Although if everyone owns a house, people have more money to spend on other things. Thus, they will buy new clothes, increase  disposable income and they will spend on luxurious items but in fact, the population will change the product more often than in their life. The result of higher spending would lead to inflation in the economy.

But we must observe realistically that the government collects taxes from the citizens of the country. So the responsibility lies in officials to take care of the individuals who have been living and working in these countries and make sure nobody is left homeless. They should build  new buildings to accommodate people who cannot afford such  expensive properties. When they do that, there will be a lot of benefits. For example, this will help to reduce poverty  in the country because instead of spending an enormous amount of money to buy a house , they can use this money for their life to get food. Furthermore, decreasing the crime rate since the poor will do anything to steal valuable things that they are not able to afford.

 In conclusion, with the aforementioned, I totally agree with the idea to build a free house for people who can not afford it is applicable  because of  the benefits it brings.",4,5.5
Many people use social media every day to get in touch with others and news events. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"Technology have ushered in a new era, but have also brought some certain evils. Majority of people believe that the usage of social media is helpful, as it give chance to get in touch with one other. Additionally, it can also provide some news information which is going on daily basis. This essay will discuss about the advantages in detail.

At the onset, Social media provide an online platform for the people who are living far away from each other. This make a chance for them to be in contact with one other. By this platform, they can also send many messages including photos and viseos to each other with just one click. For Instance, In today's era, if there is a function in a family, than the family members can connect each other via this platform. Moreover, they can also send  the invitation through online.

In addition, Individuals can also get the news information from this platform. As this new generation is modern, so people share and upload news locally as well as internationally. In modern times, people have to wait for the news, but in current phase once the news is uploaded, millions of people can get to know at the same time.To prove it, In past month, there was an inaugration in India regarding to the world's largest temple. When the idol was placed in the temple, normal citizens can't see it, but at the event this whole event went online and as a result millions of people were streaming it online.

In conclusion, Although social media have many benefits, it has also few drawbacks like sharing all the personal information through dark web along with the credit and debit card details. Being on social media have benifited many people as it made new connections.",2,4.5
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Art has become increasingly popular across many countries.Some people believe that it is an important subject for students at school while others believe it is not. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail and provide my opinion.

On the one hand, many people think that art is a crucial course at schools  for various reasons.Although it is an extra effort apart from regular courses, individuals believe the future is bright for the employees in these fields since the salaries are high.For example, citizens who are good at theatre arts can get an opportunity to work in Hollywood films where the remunerations are high. Secondly, people specialized in certain artwork will become familiar personalities in the world.This will bring them huge name and fame which will remain even they are not alive.For instance,  famous books such as Shakesphere novels will remain in people's heart forever.

On the other side, some people think that art is a waste of time which is spoiling student's future.Despite there are few people who are successful in many arts, the ratio is relatively very less. To illustrate, though photography is a creative skill, very few people will become successful.Moreover, students believed in particular art and ignored their academics will regret that they have wasted a lot of time if they are unsuccessful.To give a clear example, pupils who ignored studies and concentrated only in skills will become unemployed since the success rate is very low in these creative skills. 

To conclude, this essay has discussed whether art is an important subject for students or it is a waste of time.In my opinion, though there are certain drawbacks, art is an essential subject for students at school.",10,8.5
"Some people think that robots are very important to human’s future development, while others think they are dangerous and have negative effects on society.
 Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have different views about the attitude towards robots. While some people argue that robots are detrimental to human’s society, I believe that human’s development can benefit from the proper use of robots.

On the one hand, I can understand the view taken by many people that robots may be harmful for human. Firstly, job opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, may be occupied by robots, and this is likely to result in a higher level of unemployment.For example, robots can be seen as a perfect replacement for workers in the assembly line because of their high efficiency and low cost of maintenance.Secondly, an increasing number of road accidents caused by robots or artificial intelligence have been witnessed in recent years, and the safety of the widely use of robots is still under debate. Finally, criminals or terrorists may operate terror attack remotely using robots with bombs inside, which is a serious threat to humans’ safety.

On the other hand, I would argue that robots will be vital for our future if we use them under proper guidance. They can also play an important role in doing dangerous jobs for human, including searching people in a collapsed building after an earthquake, and opponents of robots will feel differently if a member of their families is saved in this kind of circumstances by them.Another key consideration when judging the effects of robots have on society would be its widely use in space project. For instance, robots allow scientists to collect rock species and operate scientific analysis on Mars, which is important for our understanding in terms of space. Furthermore, governments should introduce laws to regulate the proper use of robots for both corporations and individuals, and any kinds of illegal use will be strictly punished.

In conclusion, I believe that under proper regulations, the benefit of robot far outweigh its drawbacks and it is crucial for the future development of mankind.",6,6.5

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","In this day and age, there are a wide variety of ways to achieve a successful career path. While numerous people believe that attending higher university is the optimal way to reach their career targets, others claim that it is more beneficial to opt for a job or vocational training after high school graduation. In this essay, I will discuss both mentioned views before drawing the conclusion why I lean toward the former. 

On the one hand, it is understandable why finding a job immediately after leaving school is an advantageous means of achieving goals, given that this saves a huge amount of time and money for people. By doing this, young adults do not have to spend as much time as college students in order to be employed and start earning money, since there are a great number of short vocational training courses which enable learners to get a job right after finishing them. As a result, they can still have a successful career without having to make a huge effort and pay a lucrative amount of money for university, as long as they have goals and determination.

On the other hand, it is also reasonable to apply for university if one’s aim is to have a good profession, in terms of chances of being employed and better working conditions. The primary reason is that during their college years, they can deepen their knowledge about their chosen fields, as well as acquiring hands-on experiences and soft skills such as team-working and communicating, which makes them more accomplished and have more potential to convince employers. As a result, having an occupation and getting promoted will not be a challenge for them. Additionally, workers that graduate from universities tend to have better working conditions and policies than those who did not attend higher education. For example, an office worker who went to college does not have to work under as extreme conditions as manual workers. 

In conclusion, going to university facilitates the journey to getting a desired career as it supplies students with professional understanding. Nonetheless, going straight to the employment market is also a good way to be successful.",7,7.0
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays. Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem. However, from the way I am thinking, I do not agree with this idea.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that one of many government responsibilities is to ensure that the residents have houses to live in. I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.

On top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help. What I want to say is that only government  can solve this issue. 

To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations.",4,5.5
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school, while others think it is a waste of time.
Dicuss both sides and give your opinion.","Some argue that an art class is crucial for youngsters at  school, while others neglect its impact. It is a common belief that art is not necessary for primary school as fundamental knowledge is more important. However, I firmly believe that learning about art is more advantageous due to having creativity and mental development. 

On the one hand, it can be argued that art is useless when starting higher education. To explain more, subjects, such as mathematics and science, are considered crucial classes to enhance children's academic performance for applying to universities. Thus, spending more time on ordinary subjects to build solid academic backgrounds can be more significant rather than drawing or listening to music. In fact, primary school teachers in South Korea frequently mention that some students are doing maths homework from private institutions during the art classes as they treat the art as not helpful when it comes to tertiary education. Due to this tendency, it might be suggested that art can be replaced with more valuable classes.

Considering this factor, I still think art can have many benefits, like enhancing creativity and being emotionally mature. When it comes to creativity, it can be improved when people are younger by conducting art activities. Young individuals can improve their creativity by drawing, which helps them to widely imagine and think childish. Putting their imaginations into the sketch provides confidence that they can create what they mind in their brain. Moreover, drawing and listening to classical music can also grow their psychological maturity. It is often suggested that many professional psychologists claim that it is helpful for children to experience a number of art activities. This causes youngsters to grow their patience and peacefulness. Consequently, art classes should not be avoided in primary schools due to these positive impacts.

To conclude, although art might not be prioritised for university enrollment, it is still necessary for young individuals. This is because it can not only develop the ability of creative thinking but also enhance their mindful hearts. Therefore, I persist that art classes should be provided in all schools.",8,7.5

This essay will discuss both sides of the view and I explain the reasons why I agree how positive it is.

It is undeniable how melody influences our daily lives. Some artists could translate poems into lyrics and makes our mood change quickly. For example, when youngers are stress or need to focus on the work, lo-fi beats is an excellent choice because the beats help us to focus.Therefore, the soul is essential to improve one's mood.

On the other hand, some lyrics are aggressive and could stimulate bad behaviour in those who are still in character development.For example, the funk style always incentive unethical saying about drugs, crime and woman as an object to use to sex.Therefore, some types of rap should not be appropriate for youngers.

In my opinion, a piece is always good because it is an expression of craft and sometimes it is good to speak about that topic. For example, I always speak with my teens  that funk-rock is bad however, still an expression of art.

To conclude, trend soul could have some negative impacts but in the majority of ,cases it is a craft and help the youngers to connect with this type of profession.",4,5.5
"Some people say that to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that in order to avoid illness and disease, higher authorities ought to focus more on minimize the environmental pollution and housing issues. I agree with this notion. In the forthcoming paragaraphs, I will discuss my point of with relevant epitome.

To commence with, there is no doubt that the major reasons of spreading disease is pollution. In other words, due to industrial factories and vehicles, hazardous gases have spreaded all over which affects directly the health of the peoples. They might be diagnose with the harmful diseases such as Asthma and various respiratory diseases. For instance, a recent forcast demonstrate that the air quality of Delhi is 385 which is no doubt considered very poor. Moreover, due to the increment in the number of cars on road not only pollution is increase but also it becomes the serious life threat to humans life. Thus, reducing environment pollution should be the first priority of the government.

Besides, it is undeniable that there is a huge gap between the demand and supply of houses nowadays which leads to growth of slums in cities. To elaborate, due to less availability of residence, individuals forced to live in slums which are not hygenic, and also there are no sanitation facilities for drainage system and garbage disposal. Consequently, people health might affect. Therefore, if people have provided adequate housing facilities, the possibility of illness would be overcome.

In conclusion, I believe that government should concenrate on pollution and housing concerns due to widerspread gases and smoke which would become severe problem for humans health and also sufficient homes should constructed.",3,5.0
"IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss)","Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","School is the place of learning. Different subjects are being taught in the schools nowadays. These subjects range from Science, Maths to extracurricular like Dance, Painting and many more. This is a debatable topic that some people consider art subject is of no use while other think it is of utmost importance for the children. In this essay, I will discuss both views to this statement and conclusion at the end.

On the One hand, Art subject is invaluable because it brings creativity of children. They show their hidden talent by learning arts. It enhances motor skills, coordination and perseverance. Youngsters vent out their stress of the major subjects by giving their time to arts like music, dance, painting. They get refreshed and more capable of learning and concentrating on the major subjects. Moreover, some students develop their interest in these arts subjects and gets motivated to choose them as their career which makes them earn their livelihood in future. They get away from the rat race of becoming doctor, engineer which has cut-throat competition and becomes successful in other fields.

Contrary to this, some students do not have any interest in these art subjects. They just want to prioritize the major subjects. They want to explore more in their mains. For them, art classes are of devoid any use. They have to attend these classes forcefully which is not suitable for them. In addition to this, sometimes students lack their focus on the main subjects as they give more importance to art subject. This adversely affect their marks and they could not get passed in their final exams. These major subjects are also significant for them to pursue any further higher studies.

To conclude, I think art subject should not be made compulsory for all the students. It should be an optional one so that if the student has an interest , he or she can opt for it.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming intersted in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

what are the reasons for this ?

how can people search this?","It is become a common phenomena where people in some countries are trying to figure out about the story regarding a house or building where they are living. I will discuss about the reasons behind this and the method that can be used to get such information regarding houses and buildings.

Firstly, people need to know about the history of their house or building to make sure that they are not living in an ancient site. This means that they need to preserve the place and it also need an extra cost of repairment for instance, a good heating system or an air and light circulation. Hence, they need to know the exact information about when this bulding or house been built and what were the building standards at that time so they can improve it with its current standards. All of these information can be found from the government office especially on the building department where they have the blue print of the city or through the city's library.

Secondly, people want to make sure if the bulding or house they live in is not haunted by ghosts or was criminal site where someone was murdered. For some people as an example Chinese, they are believe in Chinese geomancy where every place has its energy that needs to be harmonized with the people and its sorrounding. Hence, an ex-murdered site house or building will have a bad energy that can affect its resident. Moreover, the information on this matter can be found through internet or daily newspapers or simply by asking the neighbours.

In conclusion, it is important to know the story behind a place where we are living to be well informed about the advantages and disadvantages if we are live in that house or building.",3,5.0
Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think that only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In metropolitan cities, the shortage of accommodation is getting a bigger problem for the citizens, whereas many believe that the government is the one who can tackle this calamity with their own rules. I agree with this statement, and I will fortify my views in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, in my mind, the populaces are moving to the cities for various reasons. For reasons, it could be a job or a university education. I just recently read one article, students have different opinions, many say, that admission to a university is far easier rather than finding space for living, and it is irrefutable, for instance, the article delineated that is this not a problem for one country, it is a global delinquent, and everyone is suffering with it. For example, in Ireland, finding a flat is trickier than having a seat in the institute. Humans are obliged to pay a very high amount of money to live, they feel unfair and is true. Many of them sleep in their vehicle due to a shortage of space. All over the globe, most students are in a trouble rather than anyone else. Nevertheless, international students have several disruptive than the locals.

 On the other hand, the administration must pay attention to resolve this matter, and I am sure they can because having the power they are more eligible to look out for this tension. In addition, many countries had a law for infrastructure and people must follow them, likewise, if they look through all the perspectives and ease some law enforcement about the residential structure then it could be possible to get this phenomenon. For example, if the population will be allowed to build multistore buildings maybe we can get a solution for living. Although to my knowledge, many nations are eager to retain this challenge by putting bunkers, it is not a permanent cure. 

In conclusion, the shortage of space has created a crisis among the citizens. Government must go through this and try to change their laws about infrastructures unless in the future it will be a huge burden for all nations.",1,4.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","A society is made up of both men and women and schools act as building blocks of any civilised society. Often what we learn at school consciously or subconsciously goes with us a long way . In many countries , parents have the choice to send their kids to same-sexsex schools or co-educational schools.I totally agree that children going to single-sexsex schools have disadvantages later in life. Analysing the behaviour patterns and awkwardness developed towards other sex due to atmosphere in such schools and the gender bias imbibed by not maintaining a balanced society will help advocate this.

Firstly , students who spend most of their time with the same sex might develop  awkward behaviour when interacting with the other gender . For example , it's not a hidden fact that most of the meaningful friendships are formed during school time therefore kids in same-sexsex schools tend to share their thoughts and feelings only with one gender , over the time it becomes difficult for them to open up with the other sex. Hence , same-sexsex schools create a communication barrier and behavioural eccentricity in them.

Secondly , since such kids become more accustomed to one gender and tend to align and share their thoughts with only them hence a feeling of gender bias arises in them. For instance , it might be difficult for females in all-girls schools to accept that males have the same spectrum of emotions as them and further tend to refrain themselves from indulging with other sex. Similarly for boys, it might be a complex thought that girls can also be physically as strong as guys hence a sense of bias might develop . Thus , same-sexsex school also adds the disadvantage of a gender bias in  society.

In the nutshell , same-gendergender schools have many disadvantages and it is correct to say that these disadvantages are added later in a child's life when they have to face the real world. The world needs a balanced and perfect amalgamation of experiences and perspectives of both the sex . Hence this should be introduced early in a student's life through co-educational schools .",4,5.5
Some people find advertisements amusing or annoying and they are not influenced by this when they shop. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a controversial perspective heating up a debate whether advertising is entertaining or aggravating, it has no effect on customers’ decisions when they go shopping. While this statement is valid to some extent, I would contend that it has certain influences on consumer’s choice.

Without a shadow of a doubt, there are numerous factors that influence a purchase besides promoting, especially the price of the product. It cannot be denied that if a customer's financial resources are insufficient, no matter how much advertising is given, they will choose not to buy the merchandise. For example, Foreo facial cleanser has not truly convinced users to buy it because of its prohibitive price, despite being widely advertised and receiving positive reviews for the quality and effectiveness. Hence, the buying choice may not be influenced by advertising.

On the other hand, consumer’s behavior is somewhat influenced by advertising. In this fast - paced world, coming across ads is a daily occurrence. Therefore, by using advertisements, the enterprise’s item can catch consumers’ eyes and make them have a snap decision to purchase. For instance, thanks to the cooperation with KOLs and running ads on the tiktok platform, Tingoan has attracted numerous customers and their revenue increased significantly. Hence, advertising has an immeasurable power of impact on shoppers’ choices of goods.

In conclusion, advertising can both attract customers to buy a product, but it is not enough to make them make a purchase decision. However, it has a large contribution to promote the purchase decision of customers.",5,6.0
"some people believe that studying at university or college ist the best route to a succesful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after graduating from high school. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is argued that bachelor degree's holders should carry on their studies at college to get a dream profession. However, some people believe that entering the workforce right after high school is the right thing to do. I agree with the former statement and will explain the reason why in the following essay.

It must be acknowledged that thousands of applications are sent to universities, both private and public, every year. The most crucial reason behind this trend is that when they are taking tertiary education, they will be taught by well-respected professors and industry experts, who will guide them through their study journey and analyze their specialties. Then they can find out if they are suitable for the job and may decide to change their career before getting an undesirable job. 

Additionally, during their time at universities, they can enjoy social life with all the clubs and societies, as well as work in the companies as interns. In the future, they can be used to enrich your CV and make it different from others. Extensive research has consistently shown that more and more firms and corporations are also interested in the university and community activities besides grades. In 2022, it is estimated that 507,300 job applications that consist of those activities are accepted in Vietnam.

 Those against a higher education emphasize practical skills and valuable contacts. They argued that instead of taking boring lectures, they can both cultivate relevant job skills and transferrable skills. Therefore, they will have more experience in the field than the seniors. Furthermore, they will develop a useful network of people working in the same industries, which might help them later on. This point had credibility, but most companies are still in favor of employing university graduates as they've trained properly and academically.  

In conclusion, while both ways can lead us to our goal in career, it is easier to get a high-paid occupation if you enroll in tertiary education. This way can help you get more job opportunities and have access to high-powered positions.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a

successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after

school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Some people argue that higher education is the key to accomplishing a career, while others argue that finding a job as soon as you leave school is the best method to succeed in their profession. I believe that secondary and tertiary schooling are crucial because there are more opportunities for well-paid careers.

On the one hand, the minimum requirement for some professions is a degree. For example, doctors are highly valued by society and paid well in many countries. However,generally, no one becomes a doctor without a relevant MBBS degree and medical training in a medical college. In addition, nowadays, competition for a job is higher than ever before due to the increase in population, and therefore, the candidate who has the most educational qualification wins.

On the other hand, getting a job is the method by which ayou finish person can become independent;wordsother word, people can earn money when they ae so thereforeliven tolerate without support from their parents. Furthermore, as employees gain more experience and work in the field for longer periods of time, they excel in the field.Een though, be earnedy can earn by doing a job as soon as finishing  school, those who have completed a higher education can earn more than them. So I believe that continuing education is the most effective way to succeed in a career.

In conclusion, although finding a job as soon as leaving school leads to financial independence, higher education requires the most skilled professions; therefore, I believe that people can succeed in their career field more when they have a degree.",3,5.0
"Studies shows that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released.
To extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","The latest research shows that most of the offenders have very little formal education. Some people believe that in order to combat the aforementioned issue wrongdoers must be educated while they are serving sentence in the prisons, so that they could have better employment opportunities once they are released. I firmly agree with this viewpoint because this will help them to become a better and productive member of  society.

Education will open many doors for the offenders. By becoming a degree or certificate holder, they will be in a better position to apply for the jobs. For instance, some fields, such as accounting and bookkeeping, require basic knowledge about the subject before they hire someone for the task. Therefore, by completing an online diploma in accountancy while serving a prison sentence could be a major advantage for the criminals to apply for the job. 

In addition to the certifications, skills learning/education ought to be encouraged in prisons. If a person learns electrical or plumbing skills during jail term, he can immediately apply for the work once he is out of the prison. This new employment opportunity will provide them with enough earnings to pay for their bills and support their lifestyle. Hence, by educating prisoners, the government is providing them with an opportunity to have access to the job market which in turns helps them to stay away from the criminal actions.

 

To conclude, crime is linked to a lack of education in general. If the government facilitates prisons with academic and skills educational facilities, offenders could have better employment opportunities once there are released in the society which helps them to stay away from the crime. Therefore, I suggest central bodies should allocate budget for the training and development of the wrongdoers.",7,7.0
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the world is developing at a fast pace, the market price  each and every time is increasing rapidly, due to this people are eager to earn money and this has become a prominent factor in one's life today. I agree that, even though there are several factors that let people  stay in their job, when it comes to money  is the most important factor. However money is not the essential item for people to stay in their work there are other factors as well, this essay will outline the points for my agreement with examples. 

Day by day the needs and wants of people are increasing due to the globalisation we are facing, as a consequence people tend to find high paid jobs to earn a huge income to learn a better life. To exemplify, a much younger generation of children are choosing their careers in IT section because they know in the next 5 years, the job market in IT pays the highest salary. As a result one of the main factors to hold the jobs people have no matter how hard it is is the wages they get. 

Besides money, other factors such as job satisfaction motivate the employers to stay in their job, because if they are getting the benefits such as health insurance, food and other basic needs why should they leave their job. As an example, one of my friends is working as an assistant manager for nearly 6 years and she doesn’t want to change her job, because the eco-friendly system she works in doesn’t make her stressed in her work life and personal life. Secondly, most people like to gain experience rather than earn a huge amount of salary. 

To sum up, although money is an essential part to overcome the basic barriers in  human life job satisfaction is another reason why people stay in the workforce without changing their careers.",4,5.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate Change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is undeniable that climate change has become a major disaster on the earth we live. Consequently, some people think that they should explore a way to live with climate change instead of preventing Climate Change. I strongly disagreed with an option, and, in this essay, I will state the reasons for my view. 

Firstly, the most compelling reason for holding to my view is that it is impossible to coexist with variations in weather conditions as weather changes make it more harmful to our lives. For example, although the governments and some residents prevented as much as they can, tsunamis destroyed many people's lives and cities. From this experience, we can learn that it is impossible to live with natural disasters and need to find out ways to protect ourselves from these disasters. Moreover, some cities had been suffering flooding every year  all over the world and people are unable to say longer in flooding regions as it can also damage people's lives. Therefore, preventing weather conditions is the best way for individuals. 

Secondly, a further reason for my position is that finding options to stay in changing climates is unworkable as there are many natural disasters because of global warming. In other words, the government or some authorities in countries need to make a preventive plan to escape suffering from the effects of climate change otherwise human beings will have to say for whole lives in hazardous situations. For instance, the government of Dubai made a proper invention to avoid suffering from very high temperatures in the local country and it is clear that all residents are unable to stay with the unusual climates. Therefore, restraining unusual climate conditions make people safer to live in this world. 

To sum up, I totally disagreed with this notion as restraining global warming is safer for human beings to live instead of staying with climate change.",7,7.0

It is of the reality that communication is more advance through the use of a mobile phones but lets look at the side effects , mobile phone has made us to be anti-social amongst our loved one and family , use of social media has made most individual to have a sedimentary lifestyle character in the sense that the find it so difficult to visit  and hangout with friends and this can attribute to their health issues. Also depression is at the increase due high rate of isolation because of the use of social media. This also affects the sight leading to rye problems due to prolong usage of phone while chatting or working with the mobile devices.

Furthermore, social media endangers the younger ones who uses social media without the supervision of their elder ones into logging into various website all in the name getting information about recent events. Consequently, use of social media for communication has prevented us from having one on one happy moments with loved ones and friends. Social media has really affected lots of young ones in there academic pursuits for example, a student prefers to make research online rather than walking down to the school library to make research with the ancient text book written and reviewed by great teachers and philosophers.

In conclusion, am of the view in this essay that the side effects outweighs the advantages.",2,4.5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The importance of art in the school curriculum is a polarizing issue. While some people believe that studying art is a waste of time, others think it helps children enhance important skills. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and then I will give my own opinion.

On the one hand, there are reasons why schools should not place great emphasis on art. The first reason is that this subject offers limited future employment prospects. In other words, a career in art is often unstable and short-lived compared to non-art professions. Another reason is that not many students are artistically gifted, which is a prerequisite for a successful career. Forcing such students to study art would only take time away from other subjects and thus affect their overall performance at school.

On the other hand, art offers great benefits to schoolchildren. Firstly, it enhances their creativity. In art classes, learners are encouraged to think creatively. For example, they can learn how to blend colours available to them to create different hues for their paintings. As creativity is crucial in many fields, learning art is likely to be beneficial to young learners in their later life, especially in their future career. Secondly, their fine motor skills are also honed. In other words, drawing or painting requires dexterity and hand-eye coordination. In fact, many studies have shown that these skills will later translate into better academic outcomes for children in other subjects including writing, literacy, mathematics, and science.

In conclusion, judging from the benefits it offers, I completely agree that art plays an essential role in children’s development and therefore should not be removed from the school curriculum.",8,7.5
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Because eating healthy food is very good for our health,there are many vitamins,minerals and nutrients in it. It is supplying all of the nutrients for our body. Besides that, it is very good for the teen people because they are in the development process if they eat healthy food every day,they never have pimples and short,they will be taller and stronger. Especialy smarter.

      We can make some leaflets and designs some advice like “You should eat healthy food and do exercise regularly”on  paper and stick it in the wall or give it to your friends or strangers to give them a piece of advice.

   Besides that,  exercise regularly helps us train our speed and helps our bones solid. We can get up early and do some exercise such as running,walking or cycling for 30 to 60 minutes every day.

 In sum, eating healthy food and doing exercise is an important things that we should  realize in our life.",0,<4
"Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects.  Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The importance of global media appears to increase year after year, so much so there have been calls to introduce news channels into the classroom. I believe this to be politically dangerous and potentially damaging due to the nature of international media.

 

Firstly, considering the importance education has in a modern society, it is extremely worrying and dangerous to even consider substituting school subjects with international news. This is because the danger lies in choosing a correct, balanced, unbiased and neutral news source, if one even exists. For example, if a child spent their school days watching FOX NEWS, they would potentially have a skewed opinion of the world due to its unabashed right-wing credentials. Therefore, changing a child’s information diet from traditional subjects such as music, PE, or geography to watching a potentially partisan news channel is an extremely worrying and risky idea.

 

Secondly, if international news were to become a new subject it could have a detrimental emotional impact on young minds. This is because in general the majority of news is of a negative nature, hence the expression, “If it bleeds, it leads”. For example, studies by the EFE News Agency show that 85% of headlines are negative in nature, usually referring to natural disasters, war, famine, etc. The logic of having these types of stories beamed into a school to those of an impressionable age has to be challenged. Thus the obligation of watching news of a negative nature makes for a convincing argument against such an innovation.

 

To conclude, due to the risk from political influences and the harsh reality of global news, I am strongly in favour of maintaining the current curriculum.",9,8.0
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"We always hear the problem that our planet is facing global warming and climate change. Some argue that a major solution to this is to increase the cost of fuel in transportation. I highly disagree that this is the best solution. This essay will discuss in detail the reasons why.

Nowadays, more and more cars are being produced by various companies. Moreover, due to cars becoming more affordable to the public, it leads to the increase of noise and air pollution. Firstly, a good solution is for the government to increase the tax on the car. Like for instance, in Singapore aspiring car owners need to bid for a Certificate of Entitlement to own a car. Also, owners need to surrender their cars after 10 years not unless they decide to renew their COE. Furthermore, the government limits the number of cars that run on the road to combat heavy traffic and pollution. Secondly, the government should build more sustainable-land transport hubs by expanding the availability of EV charging stations. In addition, having a bike lane may also encourage people to have their bicycles when going to work.

On the other hand, while increasing the fee for fuels may sound to be a good solution  it will cause our normal citizens to suffer due to its domino effects such as increase in transport fees, price of goods that are being transported from other regions and so much more.

To conclude, increasing the fuel rate might help in decreasing the ever-worsening pollution, ,however there is much more effective ways to solve this dilemma like COE in Singapore, accessible transportation for the citizens and building more bike lanes.",4,5.5

Generally speaking, there are two main reasons why people fell that after the university level or college level it is a best time for making a good career. one of the prime reasons is look for a qualityfull job. some student and people belive that if they complete their education then they easily manage any demandable work, because they already get a certificate for there qualification. Another reasons is salfe employment, beacuse much student also their aim is make a own business, for this thinking they wait for the right time. they think after gradution time is best for the start their plan and make their career.

Despite the argument, there is also case for the idea that after school level searching a job. in thise time their are so many chance to make mistake, becauce after the academy primary level nobody get much experience for any job. so easily they create any problem. in this stage there was no idea about future, beacuse their thinking level is not much advance. if they make any rong dicision on this time after that in their full life they suffer this problem.

"Education for young people is important in many countries. However, some people think that the government should spend more money on education for the adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate. Some people assert that countries should mainly focus on people from a young age, whereas others argue that the government should allocate more money to educating the adult group who do not have the ability to read and write. From my perspective, I strongly believe that money should be spent on helping illiterate adults to learn.

On the one hand, it is undoubtedly vital to focus on educating children from a young age since it will provide opportunities for the youth to develop their fundamental knowledge, therefore decreasing the number of illiterate citizens in the future. Furthermore, education in schools has been the main priority in multiple nations throughout the past few decades to enhance the country’s workforce. For example, in Vietnam, the government spends billions of dollars, which is nearly 10% of the country’s GDP, on the education field each year with the purpose of funding the young generation, therefore developing the economy in the future. 

On the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards. This is because the investment will bring a better-educated workforce, thus fostering the growth of the economy and the country’s development. With the main concentration on illiterate adults, the corollary of this would be a sustainable economy and a better society. Moreover, since adults who are not capable of reading or writing often have tremendous difficulties in social and professional life, literacy courses will provide them with the necessary knowledge to overcome such problems. For instance, participants of these classes will no longer feel helpless when they need to read a piece of story to their children before going to bed or write an email to their friends. Ultimately, they will not be deprived of promotion opportunities solely on their basis of literacy skills, or the lack thereof.

In conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently.",5,6.0
Some people think that for robots are very important to you human future development. other think that they are dangerous and have negative effect on society discuss both view and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that robots play a vital role in human life. Though some people opine that they are harmful, others find good applications for them, especially in industries. I also argue in favour of them.

Those who advocate that robotic lives are dangerous might argue that their supervision is critical. If fail to restrict properly, they will destroy the world. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence accelerates the activities of robots which will be more critical to supervision. For example, nowadays they are communicating with themselves. If it is not possible to control them now, it will not be possible to control them in future; rather, they will dominate us. So, it is better to avoid them to lead a safe life.

On the other hand, communities are more comfortable with robots, especially in critical and repetitive operations. While the system is repetitive, it is easy to operate the robot using a single program. Moreover, in some dangerous functions, like welding or working at high voltage lines, robots are more effective. Different hi-tech industries are dependent on it. Walton, a reputed company in Bangladesh, is working with these for some important and tough tasks. Some ark weldings, which are unable by human beings, are done by them. Furthermore, robotic works are accurate compared to human actions. As a result, industry demands are high and day by day it is increasing.

In conclusion, it can be said that though there is a probability of negative impacts, like controlling, the positive consequences, such as accurate, repetitive and dangerous movements functioning by them, are attractive.",7,7.0
Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Increased use of fuel and its role global warming and the green house phenomenon has long been proven. Recently, more and more people have advocated toward increasing costs of fuel in an attemt to solve this critical problem. Although it is a wondeful if we are interested in protecting our planet, I do not fully agree it will solve this problem. 

By increasing the financial burden on cars that utilize fuel, other less hazardous ways of transportation become more cost effective and may convince people to use them. For example, When driving to work with a private car will cost 20% more than using the electrical train, more and more people will use it. This has been shown repeatedly in many countries such as Canda, Israel and France. Also, a recent publication from the Jerusalem University has shown that when fuel prices increase, car pooling become much more common in comparisson to other countries leading to reduced pollution and protecting our environment. 

Although I truly believe fuel prices should be raised in order to save our planet, I do not think it will solve the problem becuase other parameters need be addressed at the same time in order to reach our goal. As an example, as long as public transportation is not accessible, people will not use it. In Germany, for example, despite the high gas prices people are still not using the trains because their stations are located 20 minutes walk from the residential areas. If train stations will become accessible more people will use it on their way to work. 

In conclusion, I believe that that increasing the costs of gasolin may lead to reduced usage of cars however, in order to achieve the required change other paramaters should be also addressed.",3,5.0
"Many university degree holders cannot find a job in their chosen profession.What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it ?","Currently,  numerous  college-level holders  are in a difficult state is looking for an occupation in their chosen career.To my way of thinking,there are two major components which are communicating skill and the standard background of the certificate have linked to the problems.So the purpose of this essay is to prove my statement is indeed reasonable.

To begin with,  university authorization is notably indispensable for job applicants in society nowadays.Therefore,interviewers are presumably to judge one's potential on their quality of study record.However,not every interviewee can demand this condition because of a high rivalry in term of achievement in academic.As a result,smart competitors are the front-runners and the rests are left behind.In order to overcome this situation, the countless youngster has been working on their pedagogical in a persistence procedure to get tremendously instructional credentials.Moreover,in the absence of university verification,people will hardly find any careers as they desire to be hence an adequate background claiming is certainly affecting their future.

On the other hand,adolescence has a good sense of communicating are preferable in many situations.To illustrate,they can  contribute the feeling of impressed to the examiner by starting a satisfactory conversation.On that account,this dominant ability is remarkably vital for surviving in this generation.Nevertheless,juveniles who lack this talent seem to be a loss for them because they barely deliver the main point of view to the questioner and even cause a mistake in their  transmission.Furthermore, an interviewee who has a large influence on their response will gain several positive feedbacks from the auditors and somehow one can pass the low expectation from others because of a low academic record.

To conclude,we can see that  communicating skill and the standard of pedagogical qualification have played an important role in the account of judgement.Although a person who has acceptable results from their background yet does not have the ability to talk thoroughly will also get a chance to fail because they miss one of the element contributors.Above that,we can a clear image of the tension of the competition at the moment.",10,8.5
"Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.
In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.
It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.
Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.
I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best
route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a
job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","While finishing school, students often encounter the dilemma of whether they should get a job or keep on studying. While some assert that it can be beneficial for one to get into the job market after graduating from school, I believe greater advantages can be seen for one to keep studying.

On one hand, access to the job market straight after school can be attractive for students for several reasons. One attractiveness is that individuals can be more economically independent at an early age, in other words, they can acquire the ability to earn income years earlier in comparison with those who decide to keep on studying. Moreover, time advantage can be utilized to amass practical experience as well as refine skills, allowing students to become better accustomed to the field and can further facilitate them to reach success in their careers.

However, from my point of view, more advantages can be anticipated by receiving higher education in college or university. Normally, higher education can guarantee individuals higher chances to attain a promising career as well as more decent salaries. For example, many professions, such as doctors, lawyers and engineers are eligible for people who finished their studies and training in university. In addition, the job market has become increasingly competitive as time proceeds. It can be relatively difficult for one to compete with others without a college degree while most competitors are graduates or even postgraduates.

In conclusion, while some factors can be attractive for one to find a job after finishing  school, I opine a more stable and promising career can be attained by keeping on the study in universities or colleges.",10,8.5

Discuss both views and give youre opinion.,"People have different opinions about playing computer games is bad for children, as opposed to it can be good in some ways. I agree with the latter, and I believe several aspects exist to further this topic. 

It is understandable why people think computer games are harmful to kids. First, it can cause some physical problems, for example, weak eyesight, unhealthy backbones, and leg problems. Second, computers are a new trend for most parents. It is hard for them to accept a new item, opposite to what they are used to playing with in the old time. Finally, indeed, PC plays need more supervision. The internet environment prevents parents from allowing their children to play. 

However, there are several reasons why I think we should not deny computer plays completely. On the one hand, nowadays the technology department is facing the most significant growth ever, our world will depend significantly on it. It is a critical skill for everyone's lives in the future, and offspring should start learning it in their childhood. Besides, these technological development are already happening in our daily life. On the other hand, everything has its drawbacks. We cannot protect kids from these things because of that. More, there are a lot of advantages to playing PC plays. They can face lots of different situations that hardly exist in real life and learn how to cope with them. Similarly, these games provide extra knowledge about this planet. Computer entertainments right now have great diversity and give plenty of choices to people. 

In conclusion, it would be really great if children were allowed to play some computer games. And I agree that there are some positive effects when kids play them.",4,5.5

Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is no agreement between supporters of the school and home education. While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.
On the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.
On the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.
In conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home",7,7.0
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","The inclusion of art in the school's curriculum has been a controversial topic. It should not be considered part of the education is thinking of some people while the opponents say that it is an essential subject. This essay will discuss both views and put forward reasons why I agree with the latter view.

On the one hand, music and dance are dominated by other subjects like science and mathematics because these play an important fundamental role in building a career. For example, scientists earn more than artists who are often homeless or struggle to make a living. Clearly, STEM subjects are a vital part of syllabi as these are the foundation for a successful life. If these are taken away from the education system, then students will be left with almost nothing to study.

On the other hand, craft is a beautiful representation of a variety of cultures and traditions which if not taught will lose its significance. Van Gogh a famous artist, for instance, would have not existed if he did not nurture his talent in his early years of life. Certainly, many potential future dancers, musicians and artists will not know their natural talent if the syllabus will not include these subjects. Therefore, it is crucial to teach the young generation so that they could grow in this field.

In my opinion, the scope might be limited but if craft is taken away from the curriculum the talent will soon fade away which needs to be nurtured by the educators in the first place. Youngsters will not be able to learn about our culture and traditions which are mainly represented by art.

To conclude, art should not lose its brilliance and  young ones should definitely learn about it. Although other subjects should be treated equally important, the craft should be eliminated from the education system.",2,4.5
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education so that they can at least read, write and use numbers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty is the most common problem in many developing nations. Offering free primary education is believed to be the best way to solve this problem, so that people can improve their reading, writing and numbering skills. I strongly disagree with the aforementioned statement because of its various drawbacks. This essay will discuss the reason for my differences.

To begin with, the first and foremost reason is that only free schooling is not effective enough to develop the country. Although education can provide people with wisdom and knowledge, the development of society takes a long process. Many poor people will not see these long-term benefits and want to be provided with the basic necessities. For instance, their priority is some aspects like food, shelter and clothes. Thus, instead of joining in free tuition, many people like to do some  manual labor to make a living.

Furthermore, the government has to spend a large sum of money to provide free education. In fact, these developing countries can not afford to provide free tuition for about 6 years for all people. They have to raise the taxes of other citizens or take money from other areas to make up for it. This may add to poverty rather than solve it, and even restrain the development of society.

To conclude then, no doubt, education has its own importance to raise the country's economy, but the government still has to consider the aspirations of the poor and the amount of money they can spend. Therefore, the modernisation of existing professions and creating more job opportunities would be more impressive to combat poverty.",3,5.0
"2. Some people think that newspapers are the best way to learn news. However, others believe that they can learn news better through other media. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","When our ancestors learned how to publish a newspaper, the world of news revolutionized. Nowadays, there are some arguments about the efficiency of newspapers and the key question is whether they are adequate to inform people or not . Achieving the best answer, this matter is to be put into a larger context.

to begin with, it is naively believed that newspapers cannot  support the local news and it prioritizes the international and global news in the first place. for instance, the prediction of insect attack on a small land is not covered in a good way, so the local people will not be ready for subsequent circumstances. moreover, due to the low speed of publishing a newspaper, it is disabled to keep along with the pace of technology. Indeed, this traditional way is not the efficient one.

on the other hand, although most newspapers are supervised by the governments , they try to be honest and spread more reliable news to  society. In other words, I myself cannot trust  the news on the internet or social media and the risk of fake and spam information is high in new ways. there also seems that elder people are adapted to reading newspapers instead of using apps or electronic devices. to illustrate it , my mother in law is waiting for her morning local newspaper every morning and reading it is a kind of entertainment for her.therefore, it is crucial to respect their choices.

in conclusion, I think that everything has its own merits and demerits but in this case, the advantages outweigh the others. newspapers are an intertwined part of our world and omitting them needs more search.",10,8.5
Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"For years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.
Planet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.
Space exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.
Since the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.
Lastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.
In conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings.",10,8.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent times, celebrities are not known for their accomplishments, instead they are more popular for their money and glamour which sends out a negative idea to youngsters. This essay strongly agrees with this statement because of high usage of social media and top level financial status and power.


Social media is a platform where actors, actress's post their pictures and videos regularly to create more fans. Many celebs are famous for their beauty and personality, even though they have not made an impact in the film industry with their work. For instance, Aishwaria Rai after marrying Abhishek 
Bachan because of his fame has now stopped making movies, yet continues to appear on Bollywood news every now and then. People nowadays are less practical and tend to follow or believe anything their favourite stars do or say which is a bad influence on our generation. 


The financial status of these highly paid actors is another reason why it is not good for teenagers, as they tend to believe that they can achieve anything. Many teens these days force their parents to buy high quality branded makeup boxes so that they can look as glamorous as their role model. For example, makeup tutorials force teens to have every brush or every shade of the lipstick as it makes them think that is the only way one can look beautiful. I have a strong believe that this portrays negativity in a youngster's brain. Moreover, famous people have the ability to pay to get the resources they need, thus it does not matter if they are successful or not. 


To conclude,  it is very obvious that achievements are not considered as  important for celebs because richness, glam has taken over it. As a result, it sets a bad example for the younger generation. I extremely agree to this because of the influence by social media pages and usage of economic status and power.",8,7.5
"Some people say that parents have more important roles to play in children development.However, others argue that friends and television have the most significant influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","      Some people is of the opinion that parents have an important role to play in the development of children. Whereas others opine that friends and environmental factors such as television have a major role to play in children development. This essay seeks to discuss both views and my opinion will be given.
            Charity they say begins at home. In the home children should be closely monitored because development begins at an early stage. For instance, morals can be imbibed in children by telling them the essence of greets at different times,teaching them table manners at a younger stage, values and family traditions are also instilled in these children. Furthermore, parents should be in a position to decide needful activies which can also aid proper development such as, engaging in physical exercise, helping in gardening work in the house, studying etc
          Back in they days, so many families have a particular tradition of screening friends who visit their children. This is mostly done by the grandparents because most times their parents are busy with office work. Friends that have the same moral upbringing are accepted by the entire family. This is because interaction with friends have a major role to play in a childs life. Also, environmental factor such as television contributes to a child’s development. For example, a child who is always watching violent programs on television will definitely become violent to people. Watching educating and entertaining programs will affect a childs life positively.
             In summary, I am of the opinion that a childs development and upbringing should be the sole responsibility of the parents. Parents must monitor duely friends their children keep and put a restriction to channels which are unhealthy for the children’s development.

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.

You should write at least 250 words.","Nowadays, most people consider that the pupils need to some subjective science topic so that they should learn it and they have to pass their exam. The school only provide to this experience that's why if they want acquire some talent such as cooking, dressmaking or art subject then they should learn from their parent or relatives. However, on the other hand some people think about this sitiation is not correct because school should be educational roof and tutors must teach about nut only science topics but also they should teach some skills how can they do. This essay sugggests that the second view is closest to the truth but other side is not to be ignored. The discussion follows below.

First and foremost, many pupils have been studying in school for five years, sometimes their parents working and many times their mother and father can not find a enough time for rasing their child. Furthermore, These children can not learn about some skills from their parents and they do not have any opportunities than this school. The individual who dont know any skills or basic life requirement such as cooking, houseworking or dressmaking they wouldn't be qualified in the future life. For instance, according to an American psychologist, the someone who can not earn some simple life experience they do not exactly succeed in any area. 

Secondly, many people want to academic success and passing examinations and they claim that it can be if teachers teach about only this topics. Lots of the people exert the greatest motivation to children's growth and they send their children to prospering school. Additionally, this parents believe that the schools should focus on science,  quality and quantity topics, they consider if they want to some skills for their children then they can enroll the pupils in art or lifelong education centre. 

In conclusion, no one wants a negative education for their children or themselves, but some want to focus only on science and academics, while others want to acquire the skills needed for life. Although both views are right, I think it is necessary to learn life skills at school.",1,4.0
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"Nowadays, people need to deal with hundreds of advertisements from companies to retailers. In my view, this can be harmful because it can encourage people to do a series of unnecessary consumption.

In the modern world, advertisements have become an inseparable part of our life, and consumers could be influenced easily. Firstly, companies are always set up a series of promotions and shopping festivals to prompt people to consume. For example, ‘Black Friday’ in America, ‘Boxing Day’ in Canada, ‘ Double Eleven’ in China and so on. These promotion days usually come with a large percentage of discount, and that leads people to do a bunch of unnecessary purchase and over expenditure. Secondly, advertisements are usually misleading, such as alcohol and tobacco advertising will show that their products are minor harmful to human’s body. Finally, some toy’s TV commercials are focus on children with a vivid describe how fun this toy is. After watched it, youngsters fill up with curiosity, and they will buy it without thinking.

There are some methods that maybe can protect consumers. First of all, the most important thing is built up an intelligent consumption concept, for instance, when we go to the shops, and ask ourselves whether we really need that or not before we buying it. Secondly, the government is ought to restraint some misleading and harmful products’ advertisements such as liquid and cigarettes. Lastly, parents should protect their children from avoiding too much exposure to advertising, and monitor on their pocket money. 

In conclusion, although we can not escape from advertisements in the modern world, with some proper measures such as built up a common shopping sense and children protection from their parents.",9,8.0
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantage of technology outweigh the disadvantages,"A Small  number of  the public utilise online websites such as facebook to have conversation with friends and some others use the Internet to know more about current announcements. This essay is going to explain how technology benefits us by providing breaking news around the world in seconds at any location, and also how social media fills the gap in long distance relatives.

People are now in a technological period where distance does not matter for sending digital information such as photos and  videos. Real time broadcasting is helping countries to reach almost all nations in the world if they want to provide urgent messages. Apps like whatsapp are now a basic need for any smartphone user, through which connecting to other people from any place is now simple. Also services like youtube helps to conway story on their live channels.

Although advancement has brought changes in daily life, this comes with cost. The main problem of technology is there is no one to control things happening on the internet, since tracking of information such as age, location, education and interest of individuals are now done by new generations phones and cookies on websites customers visit. The spread of fake news is now a  major concern as it can harm not only the victim of it but the entire circle of his or her friends.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To
what extent do you agree or disagree?","Social relation is also critical in businesses apart from making revenue. I completely agree with this opinion due to the fact that networking and maintaining relationship with customers is vital to the continued success of any business.

Establishing any business requires capital, and irrespective of the starting amount, many business owners want to make returns. Therefore, creating a network of customers is crucial. That is, an investor needs to market his business to potential customers who will either patronise the business for direct consumption or those who will retail to final consumers. For example, many farmers in Australia either sell directly to consumers or supply their farm products to store outlets for onward selling to final consumers. This is a prove of social responsibilities in business.

Apart from networking, another factor in business is maintaining strong relationships with customers. This factor is crucial in achieving a sustainable business. The primary reason for this is that, there are competitions in businesses, therefore, those investors who can continue to satisfy the aspirations of their customers will likely survive in the competitive market. Otherwise, the business may collapse in the short term if many customers are lost. The sudden growth of Facebook, for instance, has been due to customers' satisfactory feedback. Despite the popular social media being established late after the likes of Yahoo and many others, Facebook has been a platform to reckon with among its counterparts, with millions of users. This is another proof of social responsibility in businesses.

In conclusion, accruing revenue is not the only interest in businesses. Social responsibilities like networking and maintaining relationships with customers are also important if any business will survive for a very long period of time. These are crucial factors that any business owner needs to understand.",8,7.5
Scientists tell us some activities are good for health and others are bad. Despite knowing that million of people continue doing unhealthy activities. What are the causes and what are the solutions?,"Everyone's goal  to be fit with a healthy mind and body, and today's society is being more conscious about leading a healthy lifestyle. Despite whatever scientist's advice, about what is good and bad for our body, still people continue to do unhealthy activities. In my opinion, the main cause for this is being addicted to substance abuse, and the apt solution is education and therapy, which will be further discussed in this essay.
To begin with, activities such as smoking and drinking are sill continued by a large proportion of people, despite being aware of its ill effects. In cigarettes the substance nicotine causes addiction, while in alcohol, it is due to dependance. Easy availability and peer pressure are the main reasons for this dependance. Moreover, another ill habit to be noted is that of chewing tobacco, leading to dental and oral cancers. People have been following this activity generations back and is still considered as part of a culture in some regions. For instance, in Bihar it is a custom that guests should chew pan, as a sign of gesture of accepting their hospitality.
However, various  steps can be taken to take care of these issues. One of which is, to rehabilitate  people who are addicted to drinking, by being admitted at de-addiction centres. In these centres, the patient would undergo a series of counselling and medical therapies. Whereas, in the case of nicotine, other than educating its side effects other measures are to be implemented. In which, nicotine in cigarettes needs to be replaced with nicotine gums or patches, where eventually their dependance can be reduced with time.
In conclusion, even though people are aware of the drawbacks of an unhealthy lifestyle they continue with it due to its dependance. But, these habits can be curbed to an extent by counselling and rehabilitation.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is believed by a few people that to keep studying continue after school is the better way to achieve success in the career. However, to start a work straight after high school is considered useful by others. The both sided will be discussed, But I strongly believe that the students who attend colleges and universities learn excellent skills and knowledge to get their desired jobs.

The study at graduation or post graduation level gives the number of opportunities to everyone to apply in professional life. Firstly, the students who get degree or diploma perform in a expected manners in their fields, and the employers always prefer to have someone with higher education. The jobs such as accountant, teachers, engineers, doctors, and scientist seek extraordinary skills to complete these tasks. The another reason is the people who have gone to higher eduaction institutes behave in more professional and well mannered way at their work places. These qualities are very neccessary, who are playing superior roles such as directors, and presidents of the big organizations.

On the other hand, those who think to join work directly after school is more useful, support their belief with the following ideas. Some people want to support their families financially as soon as they can, and they save money which they have to spend on their higher education and join a work directly after finishing school. Adding to this, nowadays, youth does not want to depend on their parents for longer time and want to become independent as soon as practicable. So, they start their entry level jobs in resturants, warehouses and gas stations where much study in not needed. 

In conclusion, I highly think that to get the higher degree is the better option to become more succesfull in any field instead of starting career without it.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In the current era, individuals in many nations are curious and eager to investigate the accommodation history they are living in for a large number of reasons. This essay will elaborate on the reasons for this phenomenon as well as provide information resources and approaches.  

To start with, Most populations are keen to gain information, which can be accessed from many resources, about their house's former incidents in order to acknowledge the value of those places and  provide security to their life. Firstly, Learning accommodations' history is a common part of an individual’s behaviour due to curiosity, which not only leads to the realisation about the value of those places and also the tradition. In addition, Before living in a new building or house, knowing about the security and surrounding environment would be great for long-term living. For instance, Some Communities who totally educate themselves before purchasing a house ,which experienced burglar or murder matter, can avoid the horrible incident that can happen again.

Furthermore, Nowadays, accessing data of accommodations and incidents is easier than in previous centuries, which can gain the amount of information that they want to know. Individuals can sort out from many resources such as Google, which is the most popular for current people, Facebook pages, news and others. Moreover, they are able to receive brief data, which is not supposed to be on the internet, from the former owner or neighbourhoods nearby such as the quality of environment and communities.  

In conclusion, Before moving in, people should know the accommodation’s history for their security and knowing values and traditions by sorting out from the internet, which is not that thorny for the current time.

"Some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through other media platforms.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Opinions differ as to whether the best way of getting news is by reading a newspaper or using  media platforms. While newspapers seem to be much more trustworthy I believe other media sources are a better way to get news.

Newspapers are still one of the most popular ways of transferring the news ,especially among senior citizens. On the one ,hand since all newspaper companies are registered and work under some related authorization; their publications tend to be more accurate and truthful which makes them more reliable. Moreover, every piece of news will be checked by professional journalists therefore the quality of the news is also good which will keep the reader satisfied.

On the other hand media platforms like Youtube, Instagram, telegram, etc, are easy to access and usually free. These platforms are most popular with  youngsters because they seem to be adapting better to the developments in technology. With the internet being available all over the world, anyone can have access to various sources and this means that there is a great amount of information going viral every second. More , important since the process of publishing a piece of news on social media takes less time, news spreads faster and it is more likely for someone to hear about an event for the first time in the media than newspaper. 

In ,conclusion there are differing views on choosing between newspapers and media platforms for the best way of getting the news. For the reasons mentioned ,above it seems to me that people should adjust to the new and improved ways of news transfer like the media platforms and use them more often.",9,8.0
"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others thinks that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In this day and age, international cooperation has become increasingly common, and it yields tons of advantages in many aspects. Some people claim that the primary merit of international cooperation in environmental protection, while others suppose that the main strength of such collaboration is stimulating global trade. Before presenting my perspective, this essay will examine both views.

       Admittedly, it is reasonable for some to argue that environmental protection needs global efforts. If governments from all over the world endeavor together to enact stricter laws and regulations on the discharge of pollutants and gas emissions, the space of global warming will slow down effectively. Furthermore, the multinational collaboration will be a wide-open door for many environmental organizations and scientists to exchange viable solutions and advanced technologies that could be tackle environmental issues. For example, they can discuss methods to exploit renewable energy resources to replace fossil energy sources, which may be a practical solution to minimize environmental pollution.

      When it comes to global business, cross-border cooperation plays an indispensable role in the international market boom. First and foremost, many enterprises will have a chance to conquer new markets and territories and reach more consumers, thus increasing sales and achieving the goal of maximizing business profit. In addition, global trade facilitates developing countries to approach modern techniques and professional skills, which can foster their economic development. Furthermore, international trade activities may create more employment opportunities and lessen the shortage of labor. Without economic collaboration, many countries can be challenging to address these hurdles.

 

      In conclusion, multinational collaboration is a required element to protect the environment and impulse the development of global trade. However, I believe that such cooperation should pay more attention to environmental issues to catch up with world business development.

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there are many people who believe that all teenagers have to take apart in the summer camp for their spare time which can be helpful for their society. They also feel that in general, these materials have played a crucial role on their personality. Despite of this idea, I personally disagree with this notion, hence reasons will be analysed in this article.

In my opinion, it could be a misconception about students and teenagers which are obliged to do an an unpaid job in the summer. First of all, they should have the opportunity to do whatever they want in life. However, if they forced, it may affect on the outcome of their job, because they have done something which they are not eager to do it. Secondly, when students and teenagers attend to school, they have a hectic curriculum which means they do not have adequate time to refresh their mind and peruse on their interest hobbies. Finally, with these situations, if we force them, we will kill their free time.

My idea varies widely with this notion which these obligations would be beneficial both for teenagers and their community. Firstly, by following their ideas, students are forced to do things that are against their will. So as a result, they cannot do their best in their work and after a while they will figure out that they have just wasted their time by doing these unpaid jobs. Therefore, it would not have an impact on their personality. In addition, if they are forced, we will increase the number of people who are depressed or have a lot of problems in their lives. For instance, some researches on some students in the UK indicate that those students which had gone to the summer camp, had a number of issues related to their society after that work.

In conclusion, while teenagers may choose to work for free in their spare time, I believe that we should not make this compulsory.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the current era, the debate over whether a diploma offers more advantages compared to getting a business. Some argue that starting a successful career depends on academic qualifications, while others contend that  securing employment is the best option after graduating from school. In my opinion, by enrolling in higher education, students can find enrollment.

Convincing arguments can be made that getting a job provides  experience and more effective strategies. To start with, while youngsters are working in their workplace, they might be able to improve their practical ability as well as gain interpersonal experience. For instance, although the world is undergoing  rapid change as a result it leads to an increasingly competitive job sphere, every specific industry and company`s employers do not want to recruit a volunteer who has a lack of practice. Hence improving skills that perceiving the atmosphere of real working in their adulthoods can help them prosper in their fields. 

Despite the positives of getting an occupation mentioned above, I would acknowledge that enrolling educational institution has numerous benefits. One of the desirable aspects of studying is  enhancing cognitive skills such as critical thinking, and a broader understanding of the world may increase good quality of a career. Additionally,  high global perspectives which enhance long-term career prospects can provide adults with a financial budget for their entire lives. For example, doctor or teacher and these categories of jobs always require a specialist who has sufficient ability for work. 

To conclude, while getting a job has its positives, particularly gaining experience, the predominant advantage of studying at university and college is enhancing long-term career success",4,5.5
Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"The advancement of technology has unquestionably had a significant impact on the modern world. Others believe it brings the wealthy and the impoverished closer together, thereby eliminating destitution and the archaic class system. I will discuss both perspectives as well as argue that tech has brought the poor and the affluent closer together than ever before. 

First, only the wealthy can afford and utilize particular types of technology. Some things such as expensive automobiles, automated residences, and Mars exploration are only accessible to the rich For example, Elon Musk, a prominent industrialist, plans to construct a hotel on Mars, an extraterrestrial planet. Consequently, this will broaden the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished.

Secondly, certain devices are now accessible and affordable for all socioeconomic groups. In the past, owning a mobile device was prohibitively expensive, but nowadays, mobile devices with fundamental features are common and inexpensive. Therefore, the wealthy and the impoverished can share a common online space. Thus bringing them closer to the digital universe as a whole.

In conclusion, I believe that a variety of technologies have brought people closer together than ever before, enhancing cross-border relationships and trade between all classes of people.  For instance, a starving person can post an online plea for assistance, and a wealthy philanthropist in New York can decide to send aid. Thus, bridging the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished across international boundaries. Despite the fact that automation has brought the affluent and less privileged closer together through the use of mobile phones, some people believe that the gap is widening with modern, costly tech experiences that are primarily designated for the wealthy.",8,7.5
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?","Nowadays, the more advanced the technology becomes, the more commodities have been produced due to the augmentation in people's needs. Therefore, it is undeniable that mass manufacturing would end up hurting Mother Nature inevitably. The origin of this situation seems to be derived from two main factors, while some remedies could be suggested for this statement, which will be mentioned here.

first of all, several damages to the environment could be addressed to the irresolvable productions. Moreover, the majority of consumer merchandise has been thrown away by careless citizens in Nature which will remain there for a great deal of time. For instance, plastic goods have been made in various forms and due to their flexible feature, have satisfied their producers and consumers, which is well-known for having traumatic effects on animals and their surroundings. the second factor could be the matter of destroying the waste, meaning that should the government get rid of disposals in the city, they would either burn or bury them. In addition, not only does the expansion of creating stocks put a major burden on the authority but removing the waste could have severe consequences for the environment, such as air pollution, tainted soil and water contamination.

Turning to the possible solution, firstly citizens should be encouraged to assist in rectifying their surroundings. By this, we mean that damages to Nature could be declined to the minimum provided that everyone executes some activities to approach this goal, for example, by gathering their waste and terminating throwing it away on the earth. Secondly, the government could spend time and energy on reinforcing the environment and assisting in maintaining it for the next generations. Furthermore, there have been a couple of activities that would be beneficial for this situation, such as recycling and separating harmful goods or producing eco-friendly merchandise.

To conclude, goods' disposals in Nature and various contaminations caused by burning or removing the waste could be the main causes of the damage. However, the government and the citizens could help to preserve our surroundings by recycling and purchasing eco-friendly goods.",8,7.5
"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",4,5.5
"Some people think the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent, do you agree or disagree?","I totally disagree. It is because people all are rich nowadays. They could have enough money to buy fuel for cars and other vehicles. This is not just a environment problem. This is a human thing. 
Therefore I think the best way is to replace all the fuel's car. We should have used more clean energy instead of fuel. This is why I disagree with this topic",0,<4
The only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this day and age, more and more people believe that it is essential for the government to use stricter penalties in order to reduce the large number of accidents and protect the safety of drivers. From my perspective, I partly agree with this phenomenon as I suppose that there are better ways to address these transportation-related issues.

On the one hand, there are many reasons why imposing stricter punishments for criminal driving is extremely important. More and more people using personal vehicles violate the law such as running red lights, speeding or driving drunk, leading to thousands of casualties every year. Thus, strict punishment plays an important role in improving many adverse problems related to traffic accidents. These disciplines, such as paying a heavy fine or banning them from driving for a period of time, can instill fear and discourage lawbreakers from driving again. For example, if a driver violates traffic laws, he will be given a heavy fine to remind him that he should not do it again.

On the other hand, the government should combine stricter laws with other effective measures to promote better driving habits. One suggestion is to launch campaigns related to education about proper driving behavior and the consequences of committing driving offenses in order to raise people's awareness. Another approach is to increase the legal driving age of young people, which means that they will have more time to sharpen their driving skills. Thus, the combination of these methods can create more desired results than relying on only one. 

In conclusion, not only severe punishment for driving offences but also other measures contribute to heightening people's awareness and improving road safety.",6,6.5
some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time .This can benefit teenageers and the community as well .to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s life, many people suppose that if young individuals take part in voluntary jobs, it will bring advantages to both themselves and the community. Although this is partly true, I argue that we should not force them to do these if they do not want to.

There are some reasons why parents should not require their children to work on a voluntary basis. Firstly, it is obvious that school-aged children already have enough pressure from their studying. For example, in many schools, students are forced to attend a number of extra classes; moreover, there is a huge amount of assignments from their teachers that they have to finish before classes. Therefore, not all of them are such that free to spend time on other activities. In addition, because of this studying pressure, parents should encourage them to unwind in order not to suffer from depression or stress. For instance, They should hang out more with their friends, play some sports and participate in extracurricular activities to develop their physical health as well as mental one.

It is undeniable that if volunteering becomes a must for teenagers, they will lose their right to freedom. Undoubtedly, in most countries, it will counter the value of a free and fair society if any individuals have to do work that they do not want due to requirements from others. It is a fact that people will absolutely do their tasks without their highest ability and devotion because they are obligated. As a result, the government and society can not gain anything from them.

In conclusion, in spite of some personal and social benefits from volunteer teenagers, these works should come from their desires instead of forces from others. This is because teenagers are having enough burden from their studying as well as it will against the right of humanity to be free.",8,7.5
some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think that the advantages of this technology out weigh its disadvantages?,"Nowadays, dueto technologycal advancment more and more people are using social media for personal use as well as getting regular updates of world wide. and some time its good and some time seen that it creat negative impacts on people and their life.

In a present era , social media is one kind of status for some people but on otherhand many people using it for their personal benifits and its good think and that people understand the value of it. Nowadays people use it for connecting wither relative because due to this hactic life people cannot get time to visiting some one or personal meeting but socialmedia had provided the facility that a person who live in other continent and he or she can talk face to face with their parents or dear ones. Even though, on socialmedia application we can get regular or perday news which is huge benifit of it. So, any one can get relavant information in short time. A few month ago one accident happend in one of company and after 20 minit. I got call from my relative from abroad and he informed me that one of his friend working in it please get some update about him. so it is very good media to connect to people or regular update.but every coin have two side some positive and some negative.

"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Most individuals think that modern music can have negative impact on youngsters, while others think it provides positive impact to them. To my opinion, Modern music only brings negative impact to todays youngsters, because, most music has no social values and causes ill-effects to them and their community.

People who believe that modern music provides them positive impact doesn't realize that, music is rhythm, which should provide good message and peace of mind. Comparing to older songs modern songs have too much instrument noises, which is also in high pitch. Recent songs has less words, most of the words are not clear in pronunciation, therefore it doesn't provide any value to the listeners. People argue that the tunes present in the music gives then peace of mind while listening, which is a valid point, but, there are only few songs has been released like such in recent times. Considering these modern music can't provide any positive impact to todays youngsters.

When it comes to an negative impact, modern music causes more bad effects to the young generations and to their community. Recent generation people prefer to hear songs using headphone, this instrument makes noises closer to the ears. When music has high pitch noise heard in such manner causes ear failure, due to this people will become deaf sooner. Todays music is causing more anger and rage in youngsters, because, the high instrument noises causes them to do more aggressive things. This kind of behavior causes unnecessary problems to their surroundings and their community, therefore modern music only provide negative impact to this society.

In conclusion, Modern music isn't like old music which provide social message and pleasant to hear. It only causes ill-effects on youngsters and make them to act aggressively while hearing them, this eventually cause bad situations to them and make a bad impression over them in this community.",3,5.0
Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers.rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"A school is the very significantly play role for students future.A segment group think that a school is the responsible to gain manners and intelligence  for teaching purpose of students and workers.Other group of people think that they gain by themselves without go to school,  its possible for both categories. I completely argued with students, which are covered all knowledge about primary base such as behaviour, skills, dont use unnecessary talk with others, some main little things collect by teachers.

Firstly, the more clear about education must be compulsory for every students.A teacher role is provide better manners, share knowledge about world, skills, and also provide good answers for all questions.Because its their duties.Pupils learning education related things and also non educated things by help of them teachers.some times,when the children are go to wrong way , although teacher do forgive them but parents do not except their unneccesity.Its big differences between them, that time children learned more than the parents.

On the other hand, individual portion  is the second things depends on own skills and self confidence.Its might be rarely  in children minds, despite of some pupils awake up by self and also gain few thinking about faces of critical situation effect on parents , they follow them and discuss with their parents after they realise how to compromise some times and any more about condition wise.but Its very difficult for students and workers.when ever parents have no enough money for buying some routine things then father or mother discussed about its after their son wake up and save money of self pockets, none of their arguments their parents.I think, they help families and every time support also.

In conclusion, primary method of learning  is necessary to learn by teachers and some times when the children do mistakes , but teachers do not angry with them also they could not punish also, but the parents punish them, while their son do unbehaviour with any of them.I think students do not success with out help of teachers, because its very impossible for them.By the way they can never build up their own confidence, bravery, and some staratergies by themselves.so teachers respect must be necessary for both.",1,4.0
Some people think that it is better for older schoolchildren to study a large number of subjects and develop a wide range of knowledge. Others argue that they should study a smaller number of subjects and focus on details. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Over the past decade, by virtue of advanced living standards, the educational system has gained popularity in various countries, leading to a paradigm shift in the application of multiple subjects at schools. This, therefore, is believed to be beneficial for learners. Despite the many positive ramifications that may derive from the argument, this educating style is likely to be predominantly disadvantageous to students due to the rationales outlined below. 

Admittedly, advocates of the statement that adolescent students should better learn a variety of subjects at schools may argue that this implementation not only offers learners many useful skills but also enables a foreseeable well-rounded individual. First, when attending to some intellectual subjects, namely chemistry or math, students are able to enhance their cognitive abilities. Some examples of this, particularly include the improvement of problem-solving skills like balancing chemical equations or addressing chemical reactions. Second, since a multi-subjects educating style is implemented, this necessitates a well-developed citizen. By studying many majors at schools, students might get a deeper insight into every aspect of life, leading to a complete understanding of their future.

Nevertheless, despite the feasible positive impacts above, focusing on some chosen subjects is still the optimal choice. First, favorite majors act as incentives for youngsters’ passion and motivation in learning. It should be remembered that once adolescents are encouraged to engage in the fields they are interested in, they will have opportunities to foster their talents and potential abilities themselves, therefore minimizing teachers’ efforts in terms of helping learners understand the lessons. In addition, once students can select their favored subjects, a self-learning style will be granted. If young learners can make a decision on what they will study, their independence and autonomy skills in learning will be ensured, leading to a responsible individual later on. 

In conclusion, despite the ubiquity of multi-subject avenues in education, prioritizing several selected subjects remains the most preferred choice due to the autonomic and favorable features. Because of these merits, I do expect government development aims to be drastically altered in the foreseeable future.",4,5.5
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Most people argue that employers should focus more on the quality of work and not on the dress code of employees.

"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In this contemporary era where people are busy with their chore activities, It has been seen that a section of society is keen to look at the root's of their place for instance it might be their building in which they stay or even can be about the house in which they live.

To begin with, Every country has many stories and a rich history to offer, but it all depends on an individual to what extend one is curious to know about it. When it comes to knowing about your own resident it gives a unknown pleasure, and its activity is usually carried by the family members who stay away from their mother land. These people are intrestented to know about the place the cultural area and the heritage about the house they reside in  because it gives them a sense of acheivement as they come closer and get attached to their native land. One of my friend who stays abroad, when came to visit the village he made a documentary film on the house which they owned, as it was one of the ancient houses.

           

                       However, one can conduct this activity by using many sources such as having conversation with elderly people of the locality, More over It is also possible to start with own family, like to go through the old photographs of any special occasions. To know about the locality and the house people can ask the neighbours, who might know about that place in much detail. Especially every village or house there are many workers as in, security guards who has served for a decade or so, or may be house maids they can also embark on many such incidents or some special moments what they still remember. Information from the Government servants is also a possible way such as a police man  or a fire fighter can also contribute to collect some data of the place.

                    To put it in a nutshell, It is always better to know about the place where my reside as well as , one should also have sufficient knowledge about the house or building they live in because it not only increases our knowledge but ,It also creates an unknown bond with the place.",3,5.0
Some people believe that the goverment sholud take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their retirement. What is your opinion? Is it a postive or negative development?,"In this present world, the  age of retirement is increasing as time goes by. Hence, the public is focusing on that how they can live after they quit their job permanently. I believe that people who need to be retired from their occupation should save money during their working years to prepare for the rest of life. I can explain  this matter from two main perspectives of effectiveness and uncertainty.

Firstly, the government needs to spend the budget that comes from the tax which is paid by other publics if they try to support senior folks. For instance, people can not take advantage of the taxes they are paying and they are wasting their money instead of making infrastructures which make folks happy using the money they have made. Therefore, the budget should be spent in the right way such as helping poorer or installing  convenience facilities for the public not just for the normal old men. 

Secondly, we are saving the pension generally when we work in our company. For example, we expect that fixed income will be given according to our pension system. However, the amount of pension that we are going to be supposed to get after retirement is getting decreased and it will totally run out when folks get theirs within 30 years according to some articles. Thus, the uncertainty of the fixed monetary is always pretty close to us and we do not rely on the supplement from the state.

To sum up, there are several positive and negative arguments about this matter. Nonetheless, we need to prepare our own life by ourselves and the government should make the expenditure of its budget for establishing something new and beneficial things for our offspring. We need to prepare our future with our own hands.",10,8.5
"Some People think that men museums should be enjoyable places to entertain Poople, while others belive that the purpose of museums is to educate.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Nowadays, museums have become of great importance and demand amang government and people , and the ideas and works of museums have developed people have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.

In the first opinion, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen too much educational contents, so museums often put mere of interesting and enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museume is designed to be visually speatacular, and it may hare interactive or even games as part of its exhibitions. 

On the other hand, Some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of an exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means, that the history behind the museum's exhibits need to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that the visitors can listen to detailed information abont the exhibition, this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, cultures, science and many other aspects of life.

In conclusion, it seem to me that good museums should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educationel experience so that that people can both have fun and learn something

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, environmental problems and climate change are the most popular topics for all generations. Some people believe that preventing climate change is not possible for societies. Therefore, they only encourage citizens to learn how to cope with it. However, In my perspective, I do not agree with this point of view. In the following paragraphs, the reasons to support my opinion will be examined.

It is undeniable that most people think that protecting and preventing the environment, such as the forest and the ocean, are too difficult, unrealistic, and unbelievable way. Therefore, they neglect to fix these issues and tend to find  easier solutions. Some people only  how to live with the hazardous problem. However, I do not believe that this is an appropriate way.

In my personal perspective, I believe that encouraging people to be concerned about climate change problems such as global warming, as well as educating children to learn how to protect and prevent the world would be the most effective way to address these issues  since most of these issues are caused by humans and should be fixed by them. For instance, if we generate some subjects related to climate change issues in school for the younger generation to understand people's behaviours harming the environment, it would embolden them to change some terrible habits of humans. Using some eco-friendly products and reducing plastic bags are excellent examples of how to prevent the global warming effect.

On the other hand, if people neglect these climate downsides and still behave in the same ways as before, our world will harm and affect not only humans but also animals, such as wildlife animals, whose habitats will be destroyed and they will be extinct in the future.

In conclusion, people should urge and have the courage to prevent climate change. This will be the best solution and will change our earth into a peaceful place. In addition, both humans and animals will live in this world peacefully.",6,6.5
"IN SOME COUNTRIES, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OR BUILDING THEY LINE IN.

WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR THIS?

HOW CAN PEOPLE RESEARCH THIS?","One day, everybody figures out himself as a part of a family with their own biography including a genealogical tree, history of the country and the state or even the house or building where they have been living from generation to generation. The last point become more popular nowadays and is worth to be observed in detail.

To begin with, currently it’s quite uncommon to live in one house for decades. Due to this, it will turn more curious to look for historical facts connected with your family nest and ancestors if they historically live in the same place. For example, in the movie “Addams Family” their house greatly reflects the lifestyle and history of their weird family and makes the characters more self-confident in my opinion. However, it’s not mandatory to live somewhere long in order to have an interest in history of the place where you live. Being a stranger first time, people try to get acquainted closer with new place where they are going to live for a while. It helps to integrate in a new society. 

	Fortunately, the wide range of sources providing significant historical information, makes such investigation faster and more pleasant. For instance, each middle city is used to have a kind of national museum performing exhibitions about the history of the place and also about buildings. In case of absence such museum, anybody has an access to the Internet, which provides a plenty of information about everything. It’ll just taking time to look over numerous websites carefully and sort necessary sources talked about your house. Arguably, such easy access to the information has served as one more reason of high level of interesting in finding out about history of houses.

	Nevertheless, the growth of popularity of buildings’ history among people seems to be positive trend. For some it’s an important part of family’s biography, for others – the way to become part of a new society after moving. Anyway, I strongly believe that it fuels the growth of the level of culture and of human values.",2,4.5
Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Education of young individuals is highly prioritized in many countries, however, there are adults who are not able to write or read and I strongly agree that educating them is more crucial and governments should take some measures and spend money on this.

To begin with, there is no doubt that today education is essential and it should be prioritized, hence from my point of view there should not be a person who can not read or write. And that is the reason why I strongly believe that governments should spend more money on this, for instance nowadays unfortunately there are many people who can not afford to go to school and be educated due the the lack of money but if governments give those residents money to attend to school and learn how to write or read that problem will be solved in no time.

Secondly, if people do not know how to write or read they will never be able to find a job and needless to say that without working they can not survive and it can lead them to commit crimes to live. For example, they can rob others, I remember 2 years ago I read that an adult robbed a family to feed him and his family, consequently governments from around the world should spend as much money as they can to help these adults educate.

In conclusion, personally, I reckon that educating adults who can not write or read is vital and governments should spend more money on this, otherwise, it can lead to terrible consequences.",9,8.0

"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage. When it comes to tackle the problems, people think that government should increase the price of fuel, however, this is not the only solution to solve the problem. This essay will take a closer look at the side view.

First of all,  the increase in fuel cost directly discourages the utilization of private vehicles and promote the popularity in public transportations, so the released emission into the air is lessened, and it impedes the process of air pollution and global warming. For example, if gasoline is more expensive, people will tend to use the bus or train rather than their personal cars. Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power.

The cost of fuel is proportionate to higher production, which depends on machines generated by fossil fuel. For the inhabitants, especially ones living in poor countries may struggle with higher living conditions. I believe that the government play a paramount role in investing more in alternative energy for sustainable growth, and the most effective solution is to educate people for everyday awareness of our energy use and the carbon dioxide emissions.

Taking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems.",7,7.0
"Figures show that some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger.

What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?","Right proportion of population of all age groups is an important aspect for the social, economical and overall growth of a country. However, in many countries the number of younger population who are less than 15 years old has increased significantly and to a certain extent this has a detrimental effect on the society, workforce and the country. This essay delves with the current and future effects of this trend in countries where younger generation predominates the bigger portion of their population.

With regards to the current effect, an increasing competition in schools is obvious. Since younger generations are mostly school goers, parents would have to suffer to get their children admitted in a good school due to excessive competition. Many poor parents would be forced to send their children to work and earn and this will increase the child labour in many developing and underdeveloped countries. Finally the disproportion of population age distribution in such countries will lead them to the scarcity of skilled labours and other professionals. Finally, since those children are not earning members, that would negatively affect the overall economy of the country. Increasing younger population, though are mainly thought to bring negative effects to the society and country, are not always a burden. They can support their community, become better members of the society through positive competition and can contribute to the family by sharing the workload.

Considering the future effects of this trend, I believe that it would mostly depend on the economic factors and job facilities of a country. If the country has a great economic stability and can create plenty of job opportunities in the future, the under-aged population now would become the de facto to the economy in the future and that would enable the country to develop rapidly. The country will have a huge workers and professionals in the future and they would be able to increase the GDP of such a country. On the contrary, if the country fails to ensure jobs and business opportunity when those children will become adults, the outcome would be catastrophic. The unemployment and crime rate would surely increase and that would negatively affect the society.

To conclude, although a right proportion of population age distribution is necessary, this is not the case in many countries. Based on a countries economic condition, education, training, and job facilities, the increasing younger generation can be a great asses or burden.",4,5.5
"Many university graduates connot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","When young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they will find a great job upon graduation. In reality fresh graduates fail to find work in their field and some are even forced to take up below graduate level jobs. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernised. 

Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer the many enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour market has an oversupply of law graduates and deficit of engineers. 

A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems, but would require joint efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closely with employers, they could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on how many students' universities should recruit in each subject in accordance with market demand. 

In conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field because university education might not have provided them with the right skill set or in-demand profession. I think that universities and the government could improve the situation by updating the number of students in each subject in line with the market demand.",8,7.5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

Recently, there has been a discussion about whether the art subject is necessary for school children or not. Although many people oppose the suggestion of having art as one of the subjects at school also, many people support this.  However, in my opinion, like other subjects art subject is also important for the students to learn. This essay will examine both sides of the views in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, many people believe that studying art subject help the students to learn about the vast heritage and culture of the nation they belong. To put it in other words, many people strongly agree that, nowadays children are lacking  morals because of the unawareness of cultural values so, learning art subjects at school is necessary to alleviate this issue. For example, juvenile crimes are inclining because of the mentioned reason and this had been proved by the study conducted by Punjab University in India in 2018. 

On the contrary, few others completely believe that learning other subjects like science and maths will be more useful for the children in the future. This is because of advancements in technology and  people blindly think that  only technically skilled graduates will be getting better paying job opportunities. Due to this mentality, people reckon that studying art subjects are unnecessary for school children. 

In a nutshell,  people should realize the importance of learning art subjects and how these subjects offer a positive impact on student's behaviour in future. In my viewpoint, studying art subjects at school are really  beneficial.",7,7.0
Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.",11,9.0
Some people think competitive sport is important for a child's education. Others think it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opiniion,"It is frequently argued that competition in the games is quite essential for youngsters' overall development, whereas others consider it could have a detrimental impact too. In this ,essay I would like to shed light on  both perspectives along with my view.

To commence with, it has been commonly believed that  children are like clay that could be moulded in the form their mentors want them to be. If parents want their wards to be strong enough to tackle all the mental or physical problems by themselves, they ought to let them play. For instance, the sports such as football, cricket, wrestling and others require endurance and stamina to win; therefore if a child initiates to perform at an early age then he would have a good physique and sharp mind to face various circumstances. Besides, in competitive sports offspring could develop their cognitive skills , and these play a significant role in education as well. 

On the other hand, playing dangerous sports occasionally might have a bad impact on the young ones. To begin with, fighting and aggression at a high level make adults' nature stubborn. Sometimes, the arguments in the field result in serious fights, and youngsters fought over the streets with their opponents. Apart from this, the players frequently had fatal injuries, while giving their best. For example, in the tournaments young muscles got stretched or fractured during matches and toddlers have to spend days or weeks in the hospitals. Thus, they will not have any time to study and got poor academic scores. 

In conclusion, involvement in physical activities plays an integral part in the upbringing of teenagers as they can have good progression in muscles and intelligence as well, but unfortunately could lead to uncurable diseases. In my opinion, kids should be allowed to play with extra care.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The discussion about whether people should continue to study at university after high school is of great concern to the public. Some people choose to go to work instead of university, but others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I believe it is a better choose that go to universities or colleges after high school rather than work.

On one hand, there are several reasons why people prefer to look for a job directly after graduating from high school.  The first one is that they can earn money earlier, and their first plot of gold is achieved faster. As a result, it is much easier for them than undergraduates to invest or start their own business. Secondly, young people who decide to work earlier believe that they can gain experience and improve their skills in real work, which helps them to succeed in their career. For instance, it takes at last 2,000 hours apprenticeship to be a registered electrician in New Zealand, so it is obviously better to be an apprentice than studying in university if they want to be a registered electrician in the future.  

On the other hand, what I believe is that university or college gives people significantly more opportunities in terms of a successful career. Firstly, those high-income occupations like dentists, middle wives and lawyers require higher degrees, qualifications and skills, while those who have never attended university or college have no chance to enter these industries.  Another important reason is that a higher degree makes us more competitive. There is no doubt that employers prefer those applicants who have a better education background when they face hundreds of applications.  

In conclusion, it seems beneficial to work after high school, but it is absolutely much easier to succeed after getting a higher education.",9,8.0
Newspapers have an enormous influence on people’s opinions and ideas. Do you think it is a positive or negative situation?,"Newspapers have a huge impact on people's belief and the way they perceive things. In my opinion, this phenomenon is a positive one because it enlightens people with happenings around and the glob and at the same time educates the public with authentic information and opportunities.

Firstly, newspaper is a medium through which people can get acquainted with adequate knowledge of what goes around. Similar to televion, radio, and the internet, newspaper is another effective media platform that carries informative news about current happenings in local and internationa scene, which can broaden readers' visions and open their minds. In addition, newspaper is beneficial to people who do not have access to other media platforms and can make them equally informed as others. Specifically, people from underdeveloped countries or rural areas where there is a constant interrupted power or internet supply, can rely on newspapers as a source of information of ongoing pandemic.

People can be educated and benefited through newspapers since the material is very reliable. Different from all kinds of posts, videos, and advertisements that pop up on the screen, information from newspapers are more authentic and appropriate since they can be sourced from a specific writer from. It is unneccessary to worry about children being misdirected by inappropriate content or elders being deceived by fake posts from newspapers since the authorized publishers are more trustworthy. Moreover, great jobs and scholarships are advertized in newspapers can provide people with better career prospects and education opportunities, which can greatly improve readers' lives.

In conclusion, there is doubt that newspapers can bring enormous positive impacts on humans, as it can widen people's perspectives and spread great opportunities with credible materials.",3,5.0
Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.
First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.
Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.
What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.
To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.",6,6.5
Some people think that museum should be enjoyable place to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of them is to educate.discuss both views and give your opinion..,"It is true that museum play Paramount role in represting the history in various ways, to enhance our knowledge about previous culture, traditional and many more.There have been ongoing debates whether museum should be enjoyable place or educational purposes. I, however, before reaching my own opinion, discuss both sides in the upcoming paragraphs.                                                    To begin with, the  most predominent reason of museum must be entertaining site is that ""feeling of boredom"".To explain it, although, nowadays, everyone is busy in their
schedules or they do not give enough time to their family members,they can visit historical buildings. Mostly families make a family trip to visit entertaining locations. As such Rishikash, Golden temple as a term of religious places.  Another reason is ""Tourist attraction"". To illustrate it,many visitors come to see the museums from different nations.They believe that it is very fascinating  moment of them as well as they can also enjoy over there. A best illustration is that from my personal experience, last winter in January my cousin came from Canada and he had visited golden temple as well as got all knowledge about it after that he collected various pictures.As a result, museums has made a entertainment location for tourists.                                          
 on the flip side, there are multifarious reason which describe to  them behind the educational purposes.To put it simply, many schools, college and universities'  students are visiting over there  to enhance their knowledge as well as they can read about old fashion culture and see many scalpture owing to history. Moreover museums provide all previous history realted to what Happened in the past years and many more.A best example is that partition museum is renowned museum, which is located in Amritsar. It has a rich collection of stories,events,arts and artifacts related to partition of India in 1947. In turn, historical places also aid to gain the knowledge for learners.

Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .
To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .
On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .
Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .
To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.",7,7.0
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"It is an irrefutable fact that robots are developing and slowly “morphing into us”. They are able to complete everyday tasks such as turning on the oven or cooking food. They do actions we would never expect. Most communities think they are a neutral piece of technology, but scientists and engineers say otherwise.

First and foremost is their abilities. They are able to stimulate people’s actions and make them their’s. The big problem is that they will eventually “grow” to be able to be put to work by fast-food companies or other companies. Needless to say, they can also evolve to control themselves without the supervision of their owners.

	Secondly, is companies that manufacture automatons. Corporations such as Skydio make prognosticate humans that could take over the world. What those manufacturers do not realize is that those robots have the potential to take over jobs. Everyone would suffer from this economic crisis and anti-robot corporations will take action and sue some of these businesses.

	Finally, is recovery. It would not be a major problem if people were able to recover from such a tragedy(if that would ever happen). If a global issue occurred, humans would have no way to stop AI. The only solution could be for everyone to learn to code. People could stop them in various ways.

	To recapitulate, I opine that AI is going and are taking over our jobs. Although it is an issue, we could stop this while we have the chance. If we would want to accept prognosticate humans, we would need to learn coding or filming because no other job would be available.",7,7.0
"Some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The world today is characterized by the free flow of information and commodity. The frequent interaction and growing interdependence among countries have ended the days of regional isolation and absolute national sovereignty, but they have also sparked off heated controversies over the positive and negative impacts that a global culture can bring into our life.

Some people say that the widening international exchanges, both in the field of business and culture, have exerted positive influences to a nation as well as its people. To begin with, they promote business cooperation among nations. For example, large multinational companies spread the latest technologies and experience around the world, and international trade has helped so many less developed economies grow. Also, they enrich people’s lives because people of one nation are given opportunities through international tourism, exhibition and fairs, TV programmes and films, etc. to enjoy the achievements of other cultures across the globe.

However, other people argue that these conditions also create the possible danger of undermining a country’s national identity. In the first place, traditional cultures might fall victim a global media and entertainment force. This is the most evident in some parts of the world where “Americanisation” is threatening the preservation of their indigenous culture. In Viet Nam, for instance, few youngsters like or understand “Hue Court Music”, the quintessence of Vietnamese culture; they go for Hollywood movies and rock music instead. Moreover, in the process of globalization, the world is getting less linguistically diverse, as a growing number of people give up their native language for the dominant language in the world – English.

From my point of view, both arguments are the true reflections of the possible consequence of an increasing economic and cultural interaction among nations. It boosts economic integration and speeds up modernization but also creates tensions between global culture and a country’s national identity. Therefore, we should take the initiative in fighting to protect our distinct culture and identity from being submerged by other cultural or economic influences.",2,4.5

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? 
How can people research this?","Nowadays, many people pay attention to their places which have memorial contexts. This perspective has two main reasons why they feel more connected with significant places. This essay will examine two main reasons. 

To begin with, many people believe that technological improvements provided a lot of architectural benefits. On the other hand, architectural spirits of places which is the most effective in our daily lives have been stolen by technology. These days many people look for a place's spirit to connect with history and memories. However, many buildings keep up with the times but also technology made them part of the mechanical culture. For instance, if one building has its own characteristic feature, many people want to live in that place as well as ranting costs have increased by this supply ratio. 

Secondly, many people want to stay connected with their ancestors. Moreover, keeping alive their traditions and saving their memories in historical places are very important for generations. Nevertheless, the youngest generations built their career in  separate areas from their family but after their business ,experiences they want to back up their family companies. For example, if one person has a family business in the tourism area, after passing her or his ancestors he or she will begin running their hotel or hostel management because many people have already aware of this valuable know-how. 

In conclusion,  these days many people want to back their historical background. This wish gives us a piece of information about their view. Continuing a meaningful life has related to the medium  chosen for living.",10,8.5
"Some people think that robots are very important to human's future development, while others think they are dangerous and have negative effects on society.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the rapid growth of the robotics industry.However,whether the development of robotics industry would bring the possible adverse impacts has cause heated debate recently.Personally I agree more with that robots are more on the side of liberating humanity from monotonous jobs and unleashing our creativity。

First，it is obvious that the vision of the modern world where human play a important role of the creators，and artificial intelligence will construct machines to implement these creations.One of the benefits that robots free workers from repetitive and tedious job and allowed them have enough time for their creativity work and innovation.Especially in industry where robot can replace a number of people to do the same things just like people do ,which release the productivity and increase efficiency.Additionally,in a daily life context,more and more advanced robot has adopted in the healthcare,assisting surgery to success and helping disabled and senior people improve their life style.

Moreover，that is not to say that the development of robot would not cause negative effort for our daily life.In contrast，the high speed growth of robots approach to be an versatile machines that often complete quickly with precise and ask for no perks such as insurance and paid time off，leading to they increase more competition than human beings in some occupations.For instance，

Assembly line in the automobile industry has shown that the shift from human labor to machine can yield high product efficiency.

  In conclusion，as with any revolution technology，robot will give rise to some negative effects including increase employment pressure.But renewable development and choice then come.Therefore,I believe robot will play important role in the human’s future.",3,5.0
"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The importance of a job has always been debatable and has now become more controversial with a few people claiming that the social skills of a job applicant are more important than their academic achievements for a particular job position. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the given view.

Analysing the view and explaining further, I believe academic qualifications are important to enter a cooperative world. This is because there are specific criteria set by an organisation or a company for a particular job post. For instance, if you do not meet that criteria you are unable to work in that company. Academic qualifications show your skills to do a particular work. For example, if you have done a certain project during your graduation and achieved good grades by an examiner, this will showcase your skills to job givers.

Moreover, job selection has changed these days. There are three to four stages which job applicants have to pass in order to get selected. When a person applies for a particular job, the first and foremost thing that he/she has to provide is a resume. Though a resume includes your social skills but academic qualifications are the main reason why the resumes are short-listed. Moreover, there are jobs which just require your academic skills as compared to your social skills. For example, it is not important for government hackers to possess any social skills.

To conclude, according to the aforementioned points I believe that academic qualifications are an important aspect for job seekers apart from social skills.",8,7.5
Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.
In conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient. Albeit, there are also clear disadvantages, for instance, the misinterpretation of the context.",7,7.0
some people say that what children watch influences their behavior.

Although I believe that the time spent watching TV has negative impacts on young people, I think the content of programs has more marked influences on them.
On one hand, the consequences of watching TV for a long period of time are deleterious. First, The more children are exposed to TV programs, the more likely it is for them to become addicted to them. They might become more overeliant on TV for entertainment, which results in a sedentary lifestyle. Thefore, they are likely to have health risks, such as heart attack and diobety.",0,<4
Interviews from the basic selecting criteria for most large companies. However some people think that interview not a reliable method of chosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays many companies conduct interviews before hiring their employees. it is also said that interview is not a reliable method. 

Because it is related to the company's employees. So there are a lot of methods. 

     On the one hand, nowadays we know that there are more and more different types of campaigns and the like. And they definitely need skilled workers. Because companies cannot achieve anything without skilled workers. And so they always look for the best. And this is done through interviews. I think this is important. Because it is necessary to interview someone before sending them, and this is important. Through this the test of how well the new employees is suitable for the company plays and important role. 

        On the other hand, there are other ways to do it. For example. First, the vacancy is announced and what documents are required. It also says that intetviuvs is an unreliable method. . This may be true. Because the companies that use the method are using lies. Because they are only limited to interviews. No other documents are required. And this is definitely not a good direction.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own or experience.","It is argued that, despite of thinking about the saving the alterations in climate, people should adopt new methods to make a possible existence in it. Although in today’s era where the living standard has changed for good, it is not possible to live without a good atmosphere.

On the one hand side, unethical changes in the ecology are the prime cause of bad environment. In today’s era where technology is used more than need, thus the ice in the northern is turned out to in water and level of temperature is rising day-by-day. Some scientists have researched about methodology and environment in order to eliminate climate changes. For example, in India, 80% cars are banned and its production centres also sealed down, as a result the air quality index manifested better changes in the environment that was almost pollution free. This is good to take measures against climate changes in order to save the lives on this earth.

On the other hand, I believe that, living in a polluted era shortens the life span of the next generation and its consequence will also have to encounter by them. Therefore, people should adopt economically friendly life style to make their life possible for all creatures on the earth. Although, technology can cope the problems of rising temperature up to a certain extent, but it has become the grave concern around the globe, where life in high temperature deemed to be impossible for an animal creature and human being also. In fact, many bird species have been disappearing due to their bad inhabitant conditions. For example, according to the recent survey in Australia, where the temperature level is rising significantly, people are also facing skin related problem like cancer and allergy, they even do not prefer to commute during the peak time of sun.

To conclude- Technology has made the life easier from every aspect as it makes life comfortable, even in an unknown climate, but I personally believe that practice that we are adapting to make  life comfortable, are the prime reason of alternation in climate. We should take some remedial step to control it, otherwise life won’t be possible on this earth.",8,7.5
People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree),"Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS label 8 writing.

Employees should not work in jobs they don’t enjoy.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The performance of workers in completing certain tasks is considered necessary. Therefore, it is of concern of many institutions to diminish other factors causing adverse effects to the reputation of the employees including the internal ones such as enthusiasm to complete a job punctually.  In this sense, it is strongly advised to consider their enthusiasm before recruiting them to do a particular job. To have high-quality products from a job completed, some experts in human resources have recommended hiring those with high motivation while others still maintain conservative ways of thinking to recruit any worker without considering personal matters.  Newly recruited member, therefore, deserves an enabling environment so that a worker can keep pace with the requirements of a vacant position.

Toward both sides of arguments, in my personal point of view, I agree that one should work only for jobs that they like most because of some reasons. Firstly, having joy in the hearts of workers generates such amount of energy to do beyond than just getting paid at the end of a job completion. Such workers can put on more efforts to come up with innovative  solutions so that results can be made even more attractive and beyond target. In this sense, not only is the worker's desire being fulfilled, but also an employer is benefitted by having such a quality product. To exemplify, when leading a pneumonia intervention, I was able to save 523 children in Central Lombok over 400 children targeted by the project. The achievement came in such a greater number because I enjoyed the complexity applied to solve for the mortality rate there. Secondly, the happiness derived for executing a job can create a more motivating environment of work so that many workers and other stakeholders can work in much more synchronized ways to reach a single goal. In that stage, a collaboration can be much easier, and operation of an intervention can be even much cheaper. This situation can be coined by having only one energetic worker who is able to inspire others with his/her charisma powered by an illumination of a cheerful conation. To illustrate, when leading each project, I always comprehend a project intervention to internalize the energetic excitement brought-about by the project before sharing it to my co-workers when building a common understanding among us. This strategy has given me more advantage to influence my sub-ordinates with positive energy and therefore, we were all happy at the end because of excellently demonstrating an extraordinary performance in our job completion.

All in all, jobs can be an opportunity to be prosperous and having internal satisfaction at the same time. One could not be much happier than having a single job in which wealth and happiness are mounted together.",1,4.0
Some people think that art is an essencial subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Nowadays,when our society is in the stage of rapid technological development, some people consider art as an useless lesson for children at school,while others support that it is important to have knowledge in this field. It is agreed, that children should be aware of different subjects and art is not an exception. This essay,firstly,will discuss why the idea of an uselessness of this field is common these days,followed by an analysis of abilities and values which these lessons have.

To begin with, people strongly believe that  art has been seen as a waste of time,since technologies progress and influence our lives. Undoubtedly, it is important to have an awareness of modern gadgets,therefore children should be provided with computer classes. In addition, some parents have a desire to teach their kids more in science or math,because of the growing need for experts in these fields of study. Moreover, they worry about children's future incomes and they keep them restricted from  art,due to the fact that an artist is a low-paid work position.

On the other hand,  art is considered to be one of the most important subjects at school,because it develops imagination ,which will definitely have a positive impact on the future. For example, such jobs as architects, advertising or content managers and photographers to name a few, require workers with  highly developed creativity. Moreover, as we live in an era of innovations, a lot of new work opportunities appear and for instance,digital artists are highly paid. Nevertheless, not only the future is the main factor of the value of art,but also the importance of saving  humanity's historical heritage. Furthermore, each individual should have knowledge in different fields of study to keep their personality versatile.

To conclude,this essay agrees with the point of view that despite  the importance of other subjects,  art should be included in the list of school lessons, due to its undeniable value.",5,6.0

"Some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","People have different opinions when thinking about international business and cultural contacts. While some are afraid of losing their national identities when increasing cooperation in business and culture between countries over the positive effects it brings, I personally believe beneficial development is generally more crucial.

Admittedly, it is easy to understand why many people, especially those who value traditional customs, worry international exchange does harm to their national identities. Most  importing objects will popularity their effects on the target country and negatively affects their traditional lifestyle. For example, a company would bring as well as popularity to its own culture everywhere it goes. Take KFC as a case in point, recently competed and altered Vietnamese people’s eating habits and their attitudes towards the importance of a family meal which used to be highly appreciated in the past. The crowd, as a result, has deeply believed customs will disappear with global integration.

Despite the above arguments, I side with those who think that country development is a more crucial criterion. It is fact that multinational companies create a range of jobs for the community, which helps improve their living standards and boost the local economy. In my country, for instance, the chain of Samsung retail stores not only provided a thousand positions for local workers but also offered higher income for them. These kinds of job, therefore, reduce the financial burden for the government and increases job opportunities for unemployees, which leads to a safer and more satisfying society. In addition, exchanging culture helps the public enlarge their knowledge which benefits them avoid custom-related problems. Lacking cultural contacts, by contrast, often lead to tension and conflict if individuals do not understand what other value and steps across the line

In conclusion, crowds with different ideas may prioritize different criteria when thinking about international exchanging business and culture. Still, I reaffirm that these contacts are, in general, more beneficial than affecting losing identities.",10,8.5
"Whether or not someone achieves their aims is mostly by a
question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of Mr. Carter's most important jobs is that of public relations director. The purpose of this job is to establish a good attitude toward his country among the public (people) of the origin country. As part of this job, he supervises the writing and distribution of press releases (news stories) for the media. Media refers to all the ways of spreading information, such as newspapers, radio, television, and other means of communication. Media is a plural word, meaning it refers to all these means. Radio is a medium of communication; it is one of the media used for advertising. Public relations people place special news stories in the media to help build interest in the destination country. Advertisements in the media, paid for by the tourism department, also help establish interest.

Employees in public relations and advertising must be fluent in English if they work in English-speaking countries. ""To be fluent"" means to speak, read, and write a language almost as well as the natives do. Mr. Carter's staff members write advertisements, news releases, and brochures to promote travel to their country. They give lectures (talks) and show films about their country to groups of people. They answer questions about travel to their country.

Mr. Carter holds press conferences whenever something of importance or interest happens in his country. A press conference is a meeting attended by reporters from newspapers, magazines, radio, or television.

Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every way. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both view sides and give your opinion,"The computer game industry has an intrinsic role in our daily life. This enormous increase has lead to two opposite opinions on the effects of playing computer games on children. A certain people claim that computer games are detrimental to the youngsters’ health being while a few thinks it has some positive impacts on the child’s growth. In this essay, I will shed lights on these boons as well as analyze the negative aspects of playing games in front of computer screens.

Firstly, the most notable advantages of playing computer games is skills improvement. Playing computer games help enrich the young generation’s reflexion and logical thinking by providing practise in problem solving and tactical situations. In addition, the juvenile are able to meet and strike up a friendship with like minded people and share ideas with them.

Despite those benefits, spending a great amount of time playing games will face climbing rate of deleterious health issues; including obesity, heart diseases and so on. With their leisure time mostly spend on playing games in front of computer screens, the youngsters will lack sufficient physical activities; this lifestyle tendency absolutely cause gaining weight. Furthermore, violent contents in computer games could have egregious impacts on children’s behaviour since the young people would imitate the ferocious acts in the games

In conclusion, no doubt there are some pros involved in playing video games. However, parents should limit the playing time and take a proper care to overcome such issues so that children can enjoy their leisure time.",3,5.0
Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"It is true that when people advance in their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from an individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.",7,7.0
"Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are several arguments with regard to the financial support of retirements. Although there are some people who think that it is a waste of money, I believe that governments must support them .

On the one hand , Some argue that paying wages to aged people who stopped working is not essential and governments should invest this money in other parts. There might be more priority in which officials should spend the national budget on them . For example, in underdeveloped countries where there are not enough schools and hospitals, paying pension might be considered a last priority such as in Africa people even do not have anything to eat or drink . In these places, so, it would be better to improve their sanitation and education systems as well as facilitating hospitals. Moreover,society should be modernised in terms of transportations to make  commuting much easier for every citizen. Because, If these infrastructures are not developed or even repaired, a lot of accidents might happen. 

On the other hand, I agree with those who give the right to old people to receive their pensions. There are a lot of scientists and professors who dedicated most of their precious adolescence to study and improve the life quality of their fellow citizens through their innovations . If they did not do all these activities, now we would not have a prosperous society. Also, as they used to work hard and handle so much problems and pressures , they might suffer from several illnesses. Thus, they can not work and if they did not receive at least their own right, how can they afford their life. Furthermore, these individuals did enough for their community and now it is a time to enjoy more from their time and have some relaxation .

In conclusion, while it might be argued that it would be better that the national budget goes on more important issues, I believe that paying the pensions to the elderly is essential and it is their right.",6,6.5
it is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men. Does it mean that government should be encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be observed for women? do you agree or disagree with this proposition.,"Most of the high level jobs are usually undertaken by men. I totally agree with the idea of Government encouraging women to take up a certain  percentage of high level jobs by women.

Women are  considered efficient and talented as they can finish any task thrown at them. For instance, we can see most of the women handling not only the  household work  but also their career very efficiently. The health sector has more women working for them compared to men as women are more accomplished when it comes to dealing with difficult situations. But women are still discriminated for their gender because of  the deep rooted gender discrimination. Some people still believe that women cannot achieve perfect results in certain tasks and because of this reason,  they are not given the opportunity to show their worth. 
In many countries, women are paid less than their male counterparts but at the same time, they are made to work more. They are not trusted with politics or  business management and so on. The people who hire women often fear that their family would come first than their job which can lead to less profit for the company or organisation. 

It is true that women keep their family above everything because they have an  increased maternal instincts which make them protective towards their family but at the same time they can  balance everything equally whether it is professional life or family life.
History has given us many women who had made a breakthrough in almost every field. But  they were not appreciated for their hardwork. There were many women in the past who were made to fade in the background even after their greatest achievements. So it is a right decision from the part of the Government to encourage  certain percentage of high level jobs for women.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea of encouraging and accepting women for high level jobs as it will enable to receive the best out of them.",3,5.0
More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people think a solution can be to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is certainly true that the number of people who are struggling of obesity has been raising day by day in the world. Some people say that doubleing the price of such carbohydrated food can be solution of this problem. in my opinion, i do believe that it is undeniable true and some measures should be taken to address this isuue.

On the one hand, many people suffering from obesity around the world due to various reasons such as Genetical disorder, side effects of taking medication for other chronic deciese, and high craving for junk foods. Apart from that, many people are struggled from fast food because it is cheaper to have compared to high nutrition foods, so they will eventually become addicted to this kind of foods. After some point it will become hard for thyem to stop eating such foods, that slowly become harmful for our health.

There are many ways this issue can be tackled. Firstly, introducing awareness class about the adverse effects of the fast food can be a better solution for thius problem. In addition,doubling the price of high carbonated food will be a possible measure in order to reduce this problem in our society. if the price are risied , it is difficult for people to buy junk foods , so the popularity of such foods will be eliminated. Moreover, governments can eradicate some highly harmful foods from resturants.

It is undeniable true that more people are suffering from obesity these days. it is important to take possible measures to address this problem and should replace this harmful foods with nutrition food.",1,4.0
Some people say that advertising has positive economic effects. Others think it has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, advertisements have been around us in many aspects of our life. There have been disputes as to whether it would have positive effects on our economy or negative ones on our society. In my opinion, advertising is a two-edged sword so we should make consideration before taking action.

Some think that promoting can increase sales of products. A good sales volume is sure to increase the profits of factories. Meanwhile, the selling and purchasing process can enhance the flow of products and money, which is also good for the local economy. However, the cost of advertising now is relatively high due to fierce competition. Too many advertisements would account for a great budget for manufacturers. If they cannot gain a good sale, this may lead them to bankrupt. 

Others state that advertising would have negative effects on our society. This would make us feel inferior. For example, over-promoting ancient drawings of galleys with everyone more than 1 million would let us know that all our assets cannot afford a piece of ancient drawing. This may beat down our confidence. But, this may also have positive effects. For those with high self-motivation, after they know this truth, they may spare no effort to strive to have a better life. As this spirit, it should be encouraged. 

In conclusion, advertising may bring both positive and negative effects on our society and economy. As to manufacturers, before we plan to promote our products, we should take concrete consideration. As to our society, we should establish a monitoring system to encourage those who really need advertisements and bit those who would cause negative competition.",8,7.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?

Write at least 250 words","Lately, students prefer to task after pursuing the bachelor or the master’s degree. However, few believe that earning right after the secondary studies is more advantageous. I opine that education is integral to achieve what we desire in life and earning is secondary. This essay intends to elucidate both the viewpoints in the upcoming paragraphs. 

Firstly, youth who have less interest in studies, opt to work straight after the school ends. Hence, students with less calibre prefer to join some vocational courses to quickly obtain a job. Additionally, every individual is not affording to join college for diplomas or degrees, as higher education demands huge investment. For instance, my friend in Canada joined a restaurant immediately after the school to support the finances of the family. Lastly, professional qualification requires constant effort for around 3-4 years. Hence, few kids refrain themselves from enrolling in such universities as they yield profits many years later.

However, the pride and dignity associated with a university education are incomparable. To illustrate, doctors and engineers have immense respect in the society. Although, it is a time taking procedure and demands extensive concentration, yet the professionals make huge profits once they start to practise or join an organisation. Moreover, such exposure ameliorates the self confidence and enhances the personality of the individual like communication skills and they become mature enough to understand the psychology of other people. Hence, they can deal better with their customers at the job.

To conclude, although the quick money made by the job in early ages allures the young generation, yet elders of the family should guide them to study further before working. This conspicuous trend will eventually reflect a colossal upsurge in their leadership and organisational skills, thus resulting in successful career and life.",7,7.0
Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.
First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.
The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.
All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.",7,7.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is argued that society should not take measures in order to curb the degradation of the environment and instead need to accept the situation. Having accumulated a variety of solutions to tackle climate change, speaking personally, I advocate this statement because we still do not get any significant results, and it is a total waste of global budget. 

To commence, although numerous implementations in decreasing levels of emissions, that contribute to climate change, were made, global society witnesses no critical drop in them. Thus, these ecological decisions may be onsidered as inaccurate money expenses, and therefore could be spent in more beneficial ways. To exemplify, wind electricity plants that have been erected in suburbs of the capital of Kazakhstan required roughly 500 million dollars that set  confusion among residents. It has been claimed that this national money could be spent on subsidizing less advantageous spheres such as farming and oil industry. 

Despite the aforementioned argument, it is claimed that if we will find a way to live with the current climate change, people would be less stressed. In the present, increasingly more incidents about people's occurring depression about global depletion of the environment. Society would be more mentally stable if they accept the fact of it.  For example, if an individual is afraid of how he could prevent environmental issue, he will be more stress inclined; however, it will be easier to live if he will just live with it.

To conclude, I agree that we should ignore the global temperature change because most of the solutions to prevent the problem is costly, and it would be lighter stress burden on people.",7,7.0
Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself.",5,6.0
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well,"In an industrialized society where there is a strong increase in job demand, young people are permitted to do free salary work in their spare time. Some people think that this situation can benefit both teenagers and society. In this essay I will write to what level I agree with this statement.

To begin with, on the level of agreement, it is possible to find some benefit from the unpaid jobs, in fact that give the opportunity to young people to learn new skills, that they could have not learn in companies where the experience is a fundamental requirement. 

Besides, these young persons can learn without the pressure that a factory put on employees, from which required far much responsibility as they are receiving a salary.

A good example of this type of jobs are the charity shops.

On the other hands, young people should not be exploited by who hire them for free, in fact often employers need a staff and use younger to have more personal, without paying for their work, making them parts of the work that no one would do it, without teaching them anything.

From the other side, at the same time, the younger should not underestimate this great opportunity to learn new abilities, even if they are not paid for it, they should have respect for their momentary job.

In conclusion, I agree on the fact that unpaid jobs could be beneficial for younger and society, as if the situations is developed in the right approach, can bring pros both to younger that they learn new skills and a method of work and to employers that could have more staff in their workplace.",1,4.0
"In recent time economic growth has made some people richer in both developed and developing countries. While studies show that people in developing countries are happier now than before, people in developed countries are no happier than they were before.","Nobody can deny the growing economic progress in both developing and developed nations thanks to globalization and the advent of high technology. In recent years, while people living in developing countries are more content with their life than those in the past, people residing in developed countries cope with the contrary phenomenon. Basically, there’re many reasons for this phenomenon and we will discuss the issue here. 

There is no doubt that happiness is the key factor that makes people’s life more valuable. Obviously, people from developing nations, nowadays, can have higher living standards in comparison with their previous dwellers. In these countries, money plays a fundamental role in their daily life. With the rapid development of every life aspect, they strive to attain salary increments or financial rewards that enable them to escape from poverty. As a result, they become wealthier and feel happier in their life.

It is true that enjoying our lives with our beloved people, along with other welfare benefits, appears to be among the great prerequisites for the desired life apart from working and earning a living. Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Oxford University economist, and WHR collaborator says: “In terms of policy, we always feel that developing for the sake of growth cannot be considered the happiness of mankind."" From that perspective, one can figure out such valuable lessons about happiness. For one thing, financial adequacy is indispensable. Without money, many people will have to lead a poor life and feel extreme fatigue all the time. As a result, people are often under constant pressure and cannot live happily as their counterparts who remain financially stable. In order to sustain the staff’s lives at the basic level, governments should support them by providing more job opportunities, greater subsidies during difficult times such as a global pandemic or economic crisis, or greater grants in case of healthcare issues. 

 On the other hand, high competitiveness in the economy and target-related problems in modern society are factors that people are not happy about. Due to economic growth, companies have to compete fiercely against each other for the market. Therefore, employees are forced to work harder than before so that the company will not be overtaken by other companies in technology, quality, and quantity. In addition to the hectic life that they are supposed to lead, their performance at work is frequently assessed to reduce the risk of redundancy if the companies restructure or downsize. To illustrate, companies specializing in technology, and furniture, ... have to regularly update the market situation to attract customers by creating new designs and technologies. When the competition among companies becomes intense, the workers will have to put more effort into their work to get a lot of tasks done. Subsequently, such poor work-life balance will make people in developed countries no longer as happy as they used to be.

All in all, although it seems logical to accept certain reasons why more and more people have become materialistic, chasing a rich life without caring about the existing, good things around them, other aspects of life including environmental, social, and welfare issues also need to be closely taken notice of to ensure the ultimate sustainability. Human life is limited, what can be better to fulfil personal wishes as well as improve our living quality than spending more time for ourselves, travelling, discovering ourselves, nurturing our interests, and taking good care of our health. A matter of greater importance is that employers should offer their staff the dramatic availability of opportunities to enjoy their every moment of life.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and moe people are becoming interesteed in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Nowadays, people are interested in their houses or buildings’ stories about the past times in some countries. Also, I have only one reason why this incident happened and a possible way in which people can research this.

Some people believe that knowing ancient story about their homes is unnecessary, while others believe that if they know about their house’s stories, their houses will become more and more valuable to them.On the other hand, they can know how many years ago their family lived there and it makes it more memorable. Also, they think that explaining the history of their houses to their children will gain information about them. Moreover, if someone who was well-known in history possessed their building, the price of their building will increase more than we thought, and everyone will attract to this house more than before and want to buy it, and people who own that house can use their house as a museum.

However, there is one problem which is how can people research  their building’s history. Probably, the only solution is they can study documentaries and histories about their town, but it may be difficult to search for information among plenty of past. Also, some countries do not have enough documentary and local history materials, and it will become another trouble for the population who is really willing to know.

To conclude, knowing about their home’s history has numerous advantages, but it is not an easy thing we thought. If someone really wants, they need plenty of time and materials which help them to find the history of their building or house.",7,7.0
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth
than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young
people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that some people gain fame by their glamourous lifestyles rather than the work they do. While I accept that such people set a bad example for children, I totally believe that many celebrities may act as positive role models. 

Firstly, some famous people gain reputation without work for it. This is because they may have had a notorious social life, appeared in magazine covers and on reality TV programs. A good example would be Kim Kardashian, who is famous for her family TV show that is around the classy life, and dramatic events that she deliberately creates. Her success may promote the idea that building dramas might achieve popularity and wealth easily, instead of working hard in a particular field. As a result, it would have a negative impact on children who idolize her lifestyles and the way she becomes famous.

On the other hand, many stars are known for their enduring work ethic and real talents. These people devote their energy to develop their skills and abilities in the long term before achieving their accomplishments, and teenagers may learn from them the good qualities. Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, who is a world-class successful footballer, is described as an icon of great effort, ambition, and determination. This kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to work hard and aim for ambitious goals throughout the years.

In conclusion, although notorious individuals can gain popularity simply, those who apply themselves to achieve their goals in chosen areas are the true idols of young people.",9,8.0
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, the indicator of a famous person is concerning their appearance or financial position rather than their achievements. Some people suppose that it is a negative model for young people. In this essay, I am going to discuss why I agree with it.

On the one hand, teenagers will build up with the mistaken values. They always learn what they see upon the internet or television. So they will be teached incorrect concepts of money and behaviour. To achieve this purpose, they will do some illegal or unethical conducts. For example, juveniles will steal or rob brand shops to get the products that their idols possess. As a result, it will have a significant impact on their future and thoughts.

On the other hand, it influences the relationship of families. For acting like the celebrities that they follow, young people will buy the brand which the famous person is using. It needs tons of money to aim. However, they do not have ability to earn money, they can only rely on their parents. If parents cannot offer it, they may use their path for achieving it. For instance, young people may secretly take money or credit cards from their parents. Therefore, it will break trust between each other and crack domestic harmony.

In conclusion, it is better not to follow this type of person for family and avoiding crime. Those people should not be the role model of teenagers because they do not teach any useful things to them as well as leading them to walk in a wrong route.",6,6.5
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to

do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community.

They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager

and society as a whole.

Do you agree or disagree?","Many people consider that all adolescents should contribute their spare time volunteering the local community tasks. Which could be beneficial for both the nation and the individual. I am strongly in the favour of these believers. This essay will highlight a few of the advantages in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, the most predominant benefit of this trend is that the teenager could broaden their minds in the field. In other words, they can have good knowledge of the fieldwork in their school tenure which can be helpful for them to dive into the work easily. For instance, if youngster invests their free time to assist society's tasks, it can increase their wisdom which could be helpful in their job searching. On the other hand, Society can have an advantage from teenagers' unpaid services in many aspects such as cleaning the city's debris or working in a public library. Thus, volunteering could have multifarious benefits for both. 

To strengthen the view of advantage is that youngster can increase their communication skills and good life experience by interacting with elderly people. To explain it, teenagers can do unpaid service in old aged homes which could be a blessing for them and help to avoid elder loneliness. For example, By doing this, will not only increase their communication skill, but also they can obtain their whole life's experience. Therefore, society can make a strong bond between youngsters.

In conclusion, If all teenagers started to invest their free time in community services, it will not only help society, but also they can get good knowledge and better their communication skills.",10,8.5
"The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is currently a debate about whether imposing stricter penalties on inappropriate drivers is the sole solution to promoting road safety. I strongly disagree with this statement because, in my view, road safety depends not only on the severity of punishments but also on effective traffic rule enforcement and heightened public awareness.

One compelling reason why I argue that traffic rules play a pivotal role in addressing this issue is that rules form the fundamental framework that shapes societal behavior. Moreover, stringent traffic laws can deter drivers from engaging in dangerous behaviors on the road, thereby fostering a safer driving environment. To illustrate, individuals contemplating driving home after consuming alcoholic beverages, which could lead to accidents, are more likely to reconsider their actions when faced with the consequences outlined in traffic laws. Consequently, rules are instrumental in preventing potentially hazardous situations.

Another key factor supporting my stance is the importance of individual awareness and responsibility in ensuring road safety. Despite the existence of stringent penalties in traffic laws, some individuals continue to flout them. By educating drivers about these laws and cultivating a mindset of respect for fellow citizens on the road, we can significantly improve driver behavior. For example, a well-informed driver with a positive attitude toward road safety is more likely to become a responsible and law-abiding motorist, thereby contributing to a safer traffic environment. Therefore, encouraging a collective commitment to safe driving is paramount in enhancing road safety.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that achieving road safety requires more than just imposing harsher penalties on offenders. It necessitates a multifaceted approach that includes effective traffic rule enforcement and the cultivation of public awareness and responsibility. By addressing these aspects comprehensively, we can work towards building a safer and more secure road environment for everyone.",6,6.5
Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Some think that the main objective of the countries should be the increment of production of materials and goods. I partially disagree that the constant increment in production is an appropiate goal becuase it has some negative consequences.
The idea of increasing constantly the production of materials and goods is based on the globalization process where each export and import goods and products, it is part of the globalise commerce. However, it is well-known that this practise represent negative aspects for the domestic economic and for the worldwide environment. For instance, in the free trade relationships between coutries, they negotiate the interchange of products, nontheless, in many times those trades produce a surplus or contrary a lack of products that increment the inflation or deflation of prices as a consequence of the invisible hand of Adams Smith that represent the offre and demand.
Addiotionally, the extraction of some natural resources such as gold, coal and crude are affecting drastically our planet. Consequences such as global warming, and huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are depleting the ozone layer. Therefore, these practices of production should be executed with the purpose of fullfil the needs of the society instead of make of this a profitable source. For instance, Natural resources should be only extracted to produce energy rather than consumed products such jewelry and so on. if we do not control our production of materials and goods, some natural disasters and social issues such as poverty and hunger will keep affecting human beings negatively.
In conclucion, although some people consider that each country should increment its production of raw materials and products as a main goal, I strongly believe that it is crucial to stablish a balance between this objective and others that affect our ecosystem and equity.",4,5.5
"More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

You should write at least 250 words","In today's Era, The variety of foods which are available to humankind is astonishing, From Instant processed food to packaged meals everything is easily obtained. People tend to compromise  their health just to save the hassle of cooking. I totally comply with increasing the price of fattening foods and I will provide legitimate reasons for it as well.

In past decades, individuals were not obese compared to the present time, it could be due to the fact that earlier processed snacks which are high in fats used to be over-priced and not everyone could afford them. For ,instance my grandfather once said to me, that after working on farms he always ate the food made at home although there were shops which used to sell quick snacks which contained unhealthy fats, Eventually he never chose to buy those things because they were costly at the end of the day, Furthermore fattening foods are cheap which is the main reason the public opts for these things.

In spite of all these reasons, companies should display the bad elements it contains alongside  cost. This will not only catch the eye of the consumer but also help them to understand what they are eating will lead them to health issues. Nevertheless, a substantial surge in fees will make customers question their purchasing reasons as well. As such in the UK, many shoppers present their delicacies with the consumption of nutrition facts alongside prices, not only this motive helps the citizens to push towards a healthy lifestyle but also makes them expand their nutritional knowledge as well.

To succinctly summarize , Indeed fattening foods are generating more obesity moreover it's due to the range of products available at such cheap bill which generally people seek to look for usually to save some pennies from their budgets.",5,6.0
Some people believe that advertising has a strong effect on a person’s decision-making process. Others feel that it has little or no real impact. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The discussion about whether or not advertisement has a significant influence on people in terms of making decisions raises a thorny question in today's complex society. Although there are good arguments in favour of people claiming there is no real impact, I strongly believe that human's decision-making process can be affected by advertising.

There are several reasons why a decision-making process could not be driven by advertisement. The main cause is that people are already aware of the purpose of the advertisement company. Therefore, most   people consider that they try to sell their own product or others' goods. In other words, they just want to tempt us to buy something by using fake advertising, so many people know this and dont do the shopping by going to the physical store or online. For example, energy drinks being displayed on TV are claimed to give energy to people truly, but it is totally wrong. And most of us know that it does not have any influence on people.

Despite the above arguments, I tend to believe that advertising is created in order to affect people's decisions before being made. It can be argued that promotions showed frequently on TV could probably permeate into peoples' subconscious. Thus, companies are paying a whopping amount of money to make people buy their commodities. It is obvious that governments are also using advertising to make a demand for any kind of product. For instance, they can advertise a machine which is fuelled by  charcoal, as a result, this product can be bought by people and the demand for charcoal will be increased automatically. 

To conclude, despite some facts that show there is little or no impact in the view of people's decision-making process, I am inclined to believe that advertising can be absorbed by our mind and can have a great influence on decisions made by us.",3,5.0
"TASK 2: Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some individuals claim that the amount of money squandered in advancing  space technology is  unjustified and they go further to say  that, it could be invested in more advantageous applications.  Personally, I strongly agree with the view since there are world regions  starving.  Albeit, these spatial researchers have their  boons. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide  anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.

On the one hand,  the interplanetary technological investigation  is public funds consuming that could be utilised  in sectors like  medical,  safety, and education. For instance, recently, NASA has frittered  roughly to a quarter of the US PIB  on the perseverance mission to the planet Mar,  the equal amount  that could be used to construct 5000 medical centres throughout the world, enhancement of others, and farming all African regions.  As a result, the world folk continues  a deep famine  as the death toll  widens. Furthermore, nowadays, there is a soaring complaint about the issue.

On the other hand, spatial apparatus development escalates the chance to figure out the human beings' new lifestyle. Because of the increased  devastation of the planet earth due to global warming, urgent actions are necessary to be taken  so that the human beings' specimen  could  discover the new crowd's home.  The recent research carried out by the University of Southampton pointed out that in Jupiter, there are more promising  conditions to people's normal life for example. Hence,  with the continued attempts  and more investment,  human beings could move to better conditions on one of  these planets. Moreover, it would save the earth's livings from extinction.

In conclusion, notwithstanding some benefits this sort of investigation results in, the overwhelming majority of individuals on the earth are in need. Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. In addition, I recommend that world-ruling power resolves the internal issues rather than spending  financial resources on frivolous activities.",11,9.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is not unusually to see young people are mandatory for doing housework. Some have argued that the youngers doing work in the association for free in their free time can have advantages both for the community and teenagers. Personally, I completely agree. In this essay, I will explain why this initiative will benefit teenagers and the neighbourhood.

The main reason why the younger should do unpaid community work is that teenagers can have a healthy lifestyle. There is no doubt that young students spending much free time gaming or studying means less time for exercise, and a much more sedentary lifestyle, which can result in chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Students will have more opportunities to exercise instead of watching TV or playing video games, for instance, if those works are mandatory for them. The healthier life youngers have, the more chances to do what they want.

In addition, in terms of association, this behaviour will save a lot of money. The neighbourhood does not need to hire more staff because there are lots of youngers doing work for free. For example,  Teenagers can do some easy work such as cleaning and helping old people, which will cost a lot of budgets. Every dollar that can be saved on hiring staff can be invested in infrastructure, which can increase the well-being of habitats. Clearly, this initiative will be a benefit to the association in the long run.

In conclusion, I do believe that compulsory works have many advantages, not only for the younger physically healthy  but also for the development of the community.",9,8.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, parents can decide between having their children learn at single-sex schools and mixed-gender schools. It is considered by some that there are some drawbacks in the single-sex environment that affects students in the future. While I agree that single-sex schools could offer children disadvantages, I believe that whether they will be faced with the negative consequences depends to a large extent on the student.

Studying in a single-sex school could be detrimental to the student's development. One reason for this is that the students might not become prepared to work in the real world. Most people will work with others of different genders in their professions. However, single-sex classrooms do not provide youngsters with opportunities to interact with others who are of the opposite sex. This could lead to difficulties working effectively with coworkers in a workplace as students might lack the skills required for it. Another reason is that people generally learn better with diverse perspectives. There are several differences between males and females in how they think and feel because of the biological differences as well as the cultural perceptions toward each sex. This enables students to look at things from various viewpoints. For example, girls mature faster in general, which can offer fresh perspectives to boys in the classroom. 

Despite the downsides which I mentioned above, how attending single-sex schools will affect a child’s future varies from person to person. For instance, some individuals will be successful if they received more benefits than disadvantages of single-sex schools. Some of the benefits include a sense of security from being surrounded by similar people and lessons that are tailored to meet the needs of each sex. Another example would be those who have plenty of opportunities to communicate with peers of the opposing sex, namely through local sports clubs or community programmes. 

In conclusion, although it is true that a single-sex school could affect young people negatively when they get old, I think that there will be those who take advantage of it. It is advisable that parents weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.",8,7.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","House or building people lived in is always a must needed for a person, maybe, for this reason, they appear little notice for us at some particular moment. However, as the development of society and living standards improved, people have the chance to look back at their living house, whether rented or own. There must be several attractive histories waiting for us to discover. Despite man's curiosity to find out stories of buildings, there must be some reasons according to culture and personality.

Firstly, some people who are mainly growing under the Asian culture look at their house location significantly, the orientation of the room, the lighting conditions, etc. they believe all these things are closely related to their future and luck, not just living level. For example, a siting in north building all ways be consider as can brings more opportunity to their own better than a sitting west house. For the more the history of the house can influence the living experience, a murder house can be a reason for their owns of failing of business or ailments, the reverse is also. A quality building can protect its own from disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes. So the history of the facilities they are living in is essential to them.

Secondly, other people are just interested in the different history stories of buildings. There must be many kinds of people who lived in a  house have been built a long time ago. However, We are not able to see them again. Nevertheless, we can still find some footprints in the rooms, such as the scuffed floor, which may be a place for dancing, and a renovated roof can say a severe storm. Furthermore, in most cases, the stories of the house relate to the memory of a family-owned from generation to generation.

Last but not least reason is some house has not only a long history but also cultural relics and even antiques, which have great value for experts to investigate and collect value, for example, many modern villas references the china quadrangle dwelling's ventilation system and make a big success. Some woodcraft, such as beam structures, have deep research value and are fascinated by architects.

     In conclusion, whatever the reason to find out the history of buildings they attracted us and valuable, we can come into the building to feel them touching and seeing or search some information about the house online.",6,6.5
Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.
In conclusion, paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying",6,6.5
"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects.

Undeniably,there are multifarious reasons behind why government should give funding to other subjects.the first and foremost reason is that in this era each and every task is operated by the robotic machines not only this but also other works are also completed by easy way like paying bills as well as some others.Apart from this, in the engineering feild mostly the work is operated through the technical devices like checking the quality of material so if the student learn these",0,<4
"most people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. why?
do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples,e.g from your knowledge or experience","In recent times a greater percentage of individuals conclude to bear offspring at a later time as against the days of old. Bearing neonate at maturity offers the opportunity to build a career and also save up financially for the well-being of this babe in contrast to a later decision  which can predispose reproductive women to various diseases such as fibroid and infertility. Also, elderly parents are too busy, lacking time and energy to cater for children.
           In my opinion, the resolution to bear children should occur at an earlier , the advantage of taking a stand to have a family at a later time  are career-building and financil stability. The individual is not easily distracted by the hassle of raising a kid and can reach the summit of her career speedily. For instance ,a cousin who resulted to having her offspring at a later age built her career to the to it's peak, she had a master degree, PhD and became a professor while serving as a firm where she also rose in position.  
An advantage of financial security results in meeting the child's needs and demand  following years of saving. 
            Parent's who take a stand to reproduce later in life may be at a disadvantaged point as various illnesses tend to crop up in the elderly, one of such include fibroid which may hinder conception.  An ncrease in age is associated with decreased fertility rate of a woman and bearing children later comes with a clause as one may not be able to reproduce at all. Lack of time and energy in raising a child is also associated with a late decision to conceive as children are not well trained and disciplined, for instance a daughter whose parents are both business Tycoons result in to prostitution due to lack of parental care and attention . More often than not,elderly parents are more engrossed in maintaining financial status quo, hence relegate the training of their children to maid. Eventually children and not disciplined.
             In conclusion the advantage of taking a stand to bear children at a later stage in life outweighs the disadvantages.",2,4.5
The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is claimed that the increasing number of traffic accidents caused by unsafe drivers; and therefore, harsher punishments must apply to control the rate of undesired events on the streets for residents. I entirely concur with this view, but to consider it as the only solution, in my opinion, does not seem perfectly reasonable as there are many effective methods that could be taken.

It is no doubt that stricter punishments could enhance the safety of drivers and pedestrians on the roads. Traffic joiners tend to be afraid of disciplines, including losing money, doing complex administration, or even being confiscated personal transport. So, they are likely to comply with the law and take more responsibility for their driving. For instance, one intendedly drives higher than the accepted speed, which causes many severe problems for himself and undesired effects on others. 

Nevertheless, there are several measurements that could bring benefits to residents, compared to the mentioned above solution. Firstly, to track ongoing activities on the road, surveillance cameras could be applied to build the conscious actions of people. In addition, those motion videos are exported that prompt people to self-control and protect personal images to their families. In developed countries such as China or Korea, for example, the government has installed follow-functional equipment along the streets to track the illegal movements of their citizens. Secondly, to improve the quality of the grid of streets, not only based on the residents but also depended on the government’s plan to transform the road system. In this way, the state-of-the-art grids could be updated, such as more signs and dividing more separated lanes for various means. To illustrate it, the main street could be classified as pedestrians, bicycles, motorbikes, cars and buses, railways, and the like, which could assist the drivers to move faster and reduce accidents as well as jams during peak hours.

In conclusion, although punishments ease to be applied and give instant results for traffic resolution, I believe that there are many reasonable strategies for reducing the attraction issues.",6,6.5
"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this has set a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner are globally known for living a lavish lifestyle rather than known for their works. Many agree that they have set unrealistic standards of happiness and success for young people. However, this essay will disagree with this view because many celebrities are also known for their professional and charity works. Besides that, many stars are also well known for using their fame for raising awareness about some of our planet’s most pressing issues.   

Despite a small number of celebrities presenting unhealthy behaviours and materialism on national TV shows, many inspirational celebrities have achieved the pinnacle of their careers and inspired the young in the process. For example, one of the Oscar-winning actors, Tom Hanks, is well known for his achievements in acting. His works have inspired many aspiring young actors to make a breakthrough in their acting careers.  Furthermore, many Grammy Award winners are more well known for their music than their fashion preferences and luxurious lifestyle. For instance, a British singer-songwriter and a Grammy Award winner, Adele, sold approximately 200,000 copies of her new album in 24 hours, showing that people passionately love her songs. 

Many stars also use their fame to raise awareness about some of our planet’s most urgent issues. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio, an Oscar-winning actor, has actively used his influence to persuade world citizens to respond to climate change. Besides donating to environmental causes, he has also urged world governments to act regarding the transition to green energy proactively. Another example is the eminent writer of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling, who has raised charity globally to help connect orphans with foster families. Her non-profit company, Lumos, has helped thousands of orphans worldwide find loving foster families.

"Some people believe that violence on television and in computer games has a damaging effect on society. Others deny that these have any significant influence on people's behaviour.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","These days, the proliferation of the media industry, including video games and television, and its violent-related content have sparked heated debates. While some critics argue that violent content has negative impacts on the community, others disagree with such a notion. This essay will examine both sides of the discussion and provide a conclusion.

Advocates of this idea argue that exposure to violence through television and video games has the detrimental effect of desensitizing young people to violence. For example, they may adopt aggressive and violent behaviours from the shows they watch or the games they play and consider them a normal part of life. As a result, this can lead to an increase in the rate of domestic violence and violent crimes, such as armed robbery and homicide.

Nevertheless, others argue that the impact media violence has had on people’s behaviour is insignificant. This is because shows and video games only serve as means of entertainment. Thus, it is common sense that game players and TV audiences are aware that any activity shown is for demonstration purposes only and would have minimal impact on how they behave. If scenes on television could have had such great impacts, other programs with educational values such as science, history, and astronomy must have had the same effect on society. In fact, the number of people who work as scientists, archaeologists, and astronomers is still relatively small compared to other professions.

In my opinion, even though media consumers can distinguish between real and virtual at a certain level, excessive exposure to violent behaviours may affect their judgment and desensitize them to violence. This is because, in order to attract more viewers, show producers often make violence as realistic as possible and include as much of this element as possible. Consequently, people may be more likely to watch these shows and engage in these games instead of other types of available programs on TV, which increases their exposure to violence in the media.

In conclusion, although violent scenes presented in the media are for entertainment purposes only and viewers are aware of this, I contend that its overabundant consumption may obscure the ability to distinguish and normalize violence for the young, which may have negative consequences for society.",9,8.0
"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that earning while studying has many advantages. There are some people support acquiring a job as long with education, others oppose this due to some reasons. In my opinion, I strongly believe in former view because it has some merits.

On the one side of the argument, it is sometimes thought students would focus only their academics instead of  getting a part- time work. This is because engaging in the other activities might result in poor performance in the examinations. Consequently, these learners would suffer a lot as they could not show an excellent educational background in their adulthood and employability would slim. For instance, in India, rarely, children have been allowed to work by both their parents as well as the teachers.

On the other hand, nevertheless, opponents of the above mentioned argument point that joining as a trainee in some work would give a better job prospects when they become adult. In other word, having an hand on experience in the field of preferrence, could give a chance to successful. For example, nursing students often work as a care giver during their student period. This not only assist to earn money, but also job related skills. Therefore, I, firmly think that joining a small work along with studies is highly essential for the futuristic employees.

In conclusion, even though people have different opinion on whether to have  a job along with studies. In my viewpoint,  I think it is a great idea to get a work as well as education.",8,7.5
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"By the present, there have been many concerns about the environment negatively affected to by human activities, and one of them is the consumer goods manufacturing. It is essential to argue how this manufacturing has negative impact to the environment and what should be done to restrict this impact. 

To begin with, consumer goods companies are responsible for the pollution. They try their best to reduce expenses to maximize profits. Because dealing with production waste is extravagant for many companies, they decide to skip this activity and emit them into the environment. There are many consequences of this decision to the environment. The majority of companies use fossil fuels as the main energy source and several toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide are emitted into the air. Because of them, air quality can decrease, impacting to photosynthesis of plants and respiration of animals. In addition, many studies indicate that the three aforementioned gases are the main cause of greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming and climate change. Another concerning consequence is the gases can result in acid rain, destroying many species in nature. As regard to water, it can be affected by liquid waste from factories, including wastewater, sludge, oil and grease. Water species can die due to these pollutants or have to migrate to other habitats. To reduce these consequences, government should impose taxation on contaminating activities of companies and taxes should be as high as possible. By this way, factories have to consider whether not dealing with waste is still beneficial for them. If companies keep this behavior, they can face strict tax punishments, which can make their products exorbitant and affect to their profit.

However, companies are not the only factor of environmental problems. Consumers are also the accomplice in the matter. Nowadays, there is a tendency among them that they use disposable goods instead of durable goods. For instance, customers are more likely to use plastic-wrapped paper cups, not conventional plastic, glass or porcelain mugs just because they want to use once only and then throw into trash bins. The trend is also apparent in using plates, people prefer the plastic-wrapped paper, not the typical plastic or the porcelain. Consequently, landfills will have to receive a great amount of garbage of disposable goods. The problem is the majority of these goods are made of materials which are usually difficult to decompose in short periods and toxic when incinerated. Therefore, people are likely to keep garbage in landfills. It is certain that land can get contaminated due to the consumption behavior of modern society. To restrict land pollution, government should impose taxes on disposable goods. Due to taxation, these goods’ costs increase and consumers are more likely to restrict using them. By this solution, the amount of waste from disposable goods can decline. 

In conclusion, the production of consumer goods impacts to the natural environment through companies, by waste, and customers, by using disposable goods. To reduce these negative effects, governments should impose taxes on waste and disposable goods. Due to taxation, companies and consumers have to think again about the possible benefits and losses they have, indirectly reducing their influence on the environment.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn and, should not have to pay tax to the state.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Money is the main source of happiness for human being. Many people considered that after so many hard work they have earned money so they want to keep that money. Although as an aware citizen, we should keep mind to provide fair tax to our government to ensure our public services. In my opinion, I believe that every citizen should pay fair taxes. 
         Firstly, Money is everything for today’s world. This is because we can buy our necessary products from money. Without money, we couldn’t ensure our future livelihood. So people make sure that they have enough money to survive. In addition, many people think that the more they can invest the more they can accumulate in the long run. As a result, they are unwilling to lose money through the deduction of tax.
       In contrast, an aware citizen should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for number of reasons. If we pay taxes in time, we can get good highway roads, hospital facilities, parks and many other public services. With the same money, people can help to ensure the economy of country. For instance, paying the tax is a way of ensuring the comfortable livelihood. 
          In conclusion, many people think that money is useful for life and they should not pay taxes. Therefore, people should avoid pay taxes as it may affect the country’s economy and public services.",1,4.0

Some people reckon that it is an extravagant waste of time to beef knowledge up, instead of this they would rather boost interior confidence and quarrel with their mentors. While their contestants suppose it would be a reduction of respect and submission among students. I believe that  teachers must not diminish the quality of education, but solidifying and inspiring also should be intruded into the educational system

To start, preachers don't have the right to keep information from students , they have to teach them knowledge as well. For example, if the child is confident but not clever enough he or she will  never pass entrance exams or make further decisions. Secondly, another reason is self-esteem does not give them superb predicaments to broaden their horizon of knowledge. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that studying sometimes might be  monotonous pupils are not eligible to cease doing hard work in order to create their desirous luxurious life in the future.

To reflect the fact that a lack of self-confidence combined with an impeccable brain might not satisfy the competent's demands of an employer or in  life as a whole. For example, the learner who hesitates would  rather not show their capabilities fully and properly. Firstly, loss of certainty in humans might turn them into grey mice who are scared to endeavour new things and steps. Secondly, individuals who don't dread  something and had a great formation at  school time could transcend all barriers. Finally, in general,durability unified with the ability to exhibit in front of the public or outpour feelings will lead to unbelievable results

In conclusion, mentors should not only teach unity but also make them  certain in expressing ideas",8,7.5
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion? 
Give reasons for your answer.","Artificially intelligent robots are steadily taking off the positions of individuals at their place of work. Even though, there is every tendency for most simple positions to be taken over in the future, it is most unlikely that occupations that deal with human beings to be completely taken over . This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be done by people and not replaced by robots .

In future , computerized devices will substitute all menial jobs that are unskilled in nature. Most employers will shift more towards the use of artificial intelligence because it is cost-effective compared to employing humans. For example , in Nigeria, accounting software is now being used for auditing and balancing accounts in various finance firms replacing the jobs of some financial analysts and auditors. In addition, this software work around the clock and requires no remunerations, performing better, faster and efficiently. For these reasons, machines will substitute posts that requires fewer human skills.

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. These jobs include psychiatrists, software developers, project managers and graphic designers, to name but a few. Computerized devices will never be able to replace some jobs because certain human beings are needed to perform those tasks.

In summary, computers and machines will most likely , in the long run gradually take up a significant number of activities. The menial professions will eventually be controlled by robots,  nevertheless, work that requires highly intelligent human skills will still be available. Ultimately, in a progressively automated workplace, limited human jobs will be safe.",5,6.0
Some people believe that eventually all the jobs will be done by artificial intelligence robots. What is your opinion?,"Artificial intelligence will take over most of the job opportunities in the future. Although effort that involves minor human interaction might take over by robots,  there will be certainly a workforce needed to fulfil a profession that requires maintaining human relationships. This essay will dictate pointers to support why the human workforce cannot be completely replaced through machinery.

Robots may eventually replace businesses where a human brain is not needed o fulfil necessary tasks. Many companies will choose to invest in artificial intelligence which instead is a cheaper resource as compared to hiring an individual. For instance, a lot of companies in Canada are switching to driverless trucks which are taking away effort opportunities from truck drivers. For these reasons, a lot of labour would be accomplished with the help of machines instead of people.

Conversely, there are jobs that cannot be replaced because bots will never achieve the capability to accomplish them. There are plenty of jobs that would always require  human assistance. To cite an example, fields such as Medicine, Psychology, Education, and social work are impossible for machineries to attain  because there will be always a need to have a human touch while implementing those tasks.

In conclusion, a significant number of assignments will be conducted by artificial intellect in the future. However, a plethora of skills, as well as emotions are not inherited in the artificial intelligence to perform tasks that require major contributions by humans. Ultimately, in ,future there will be a balance between the work achieved with the help of individuals and robots.",8,7.5

in some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. what are the reasons for this? how can people research this?,"Nowadays, it is observed that there is an upward trend among the societies in some different areas in the world that they want to realize the story behind their houses. In this essay , I will consider why this is happening and also explores some possible ways to research it.

the main reason for this trend could be that , people really keen on finding the identity of their home. What I mean by this is that  some people especially younger people prefer to know the value of their home from a historical aspect. For example, in Iran, the majority of houses particularly the old buildings, have a history  them behind. As a result, people know the historical value of their house and try to preserve it. Another reason is when you find out about your possession's value, you will try to keep it as a valuable asset. For instance, in some countries, people buy valuable houses which have a story and it could be a fine example of a good investment. Consequently, most   people tend to know the history of their home.

There are some possible solutions to find about the past of a house. For one, people could go to 

municipality of their town as the history of every single house is kept there. For another , most of the community in some cities, especially the small cities, know about the background of the houses. It can  lead to an acceptable result for the owners of these homes. Subsequently, people can use these methods and get some ideas about their houses. 

In conclusion, to reiterate there are some reasons for searching the history of some buildings which are the preservation and the financial investment. However, people can use some methods which are asking the people and municipality for more information. Should people consider these ways, they could find more impressive information.",7,7.0
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Metropoles has been suffering from  traffic for a long time. Despite the known causes, the number of  precautions taken is not sufficient.  

Unlike the past,  numerous vehicles are producing in order to ensure  public transportation and carrying goods. To begin with, the needs of trucks surged due to provide unlimited human desires such as foods, raw materials, finished industrial materials, technological devices, and clothes. For example, the population of the world was low in contrast to the now, therefore more foods and products were produced in the past. In this context, there are fewer vehicles were needed to use. However, the type of the products are variated, and more goods are manufactured, and a huge amount of the plants is cultivated, hence the vessels are needed more than before.  Secondly, the population of the urban were raised because of the movement from rural areas. Consequently, the number of cars, busses and trains went up to carry the people between the places.

Significantly,  overusing vessels can cause myriad problems like air pollution, contamination of water resources, and the quality of foods. The published researches indicate that the main reason for  pollution is the producing greenhouse gases and the crucial source of the gases are using petroleum and its derivatives. Particularly, the trucks use petroleum products, produce more gases, and have severe effects on the environment.

Even if the precautions are more costly to eliminate the causes, it is easy to implement. First, the time of the engine can be reduced. For instance, the engines can be stopped out of working times. Second, environmentally friendly trucks can be manufactured like hybrid cars. Finally, the emigration from rural areas to the cities can be minimized.

İn conclusion, the overusing of vessels have the ability to damage the environment. İf the communities desire to decline negative effects, they should take precautions.",10,8.5
"Many different countries have most shops and products as the same. Some consider it a
positive development, whereas others consider it negative. Discuss both sides and give your opinion","Nowadays, there are bunch of shops and variety of products booming in various countries. Some people might consider this as a positive development and some might consider them as negative developments. In my opinion, I vouch that it is completely a positive note.

On one hand, in this modern era a lot of things are getting developed similarly there are shops and products are opening their branches in different countries which is good sign because the market is blooming  on top of this a large variety of products are being available to a lot more population. The shops used to specific to few countries only and all the products were not available in all places. People started using online platform to reach their needs, where a lot of people got swayed by different fake websites. In addition ended up buying fake products as well. For example, when I was on a trip to London I pampered myself with some skin care goodies and I absolutely loved using them, however when I wanted to refill my products I couldn’t find them anywhere in India. So I tried finding them online, I was completely elated and ordered them but ended up getting the fake ones. So problems like this can be solved and it would be more convenient to the population across the world.

On the other hand, to open shops in different countries a lot of deforestation is happening and the land is conquered by the industrialists in order to construct buildings. The environment is getting spoiled leading to lot of consequences. For example, I purchased a villa because it had a beautiful view of the tress right next to my house and also for proper ventilation. In few months all the tress were cut off and a shopping mall was constructed. 

To conclude, According to me it is a positive development because to reach the needs of the growing population it is better to have many branches in various different countries as it would be accessible to residents in variety of  locations.",5,6.0
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.


To extent what extent to you agree?","In the current generation, people have the luxury to send their kids to  single-sex and  co-educational schools. while the majority of the people consider educating their children in a co-educational school as it possesses  great benefits. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view.

Firstly, the institute is supposed to be the microcosm of children's education, where they can interact with their peers, seniors and juniors which will guide them to evolve  with people from socio-cultural and other backgrounds. Needless to say, the years spent in university play a crucial role in shaping their life. Juneviles educated in  mixed-gender schools are confident and comfortable in the company of members of the opposite sex.

On the other hand, in  single-sex schools, youngsters can interact only with  kids  of the same sex. Which has  negative implications considering the children's future. For instance, youngsters who are educated in  single-sex institutions will be diffident when it comes to interacting with the company of members of the opposite gender. In addition to that, when it comes to working in an organisation they will find it more challenging which will make them  feel like an introvert and  can interrupt their career growth.

To conclude, single-sex school affects the confidence of students interacting with their opposite sex, however, by considering the current work trend, where the men and women associate equally in the workplace  to compete, co-operate and collaborate with each other, hence the co-educational academy are valued more and better for them by considering the future",8,7.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a  successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.",#NAME?,1,4.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is widely believed that for a country to prosper, it is of paramount importance to assure a high level of educational standard. In order to do so, some people claim that high school students should be able to make comments or even criticism on their teachers, which I believe would be beneficial despite the view that it could lead to a disrespectful and undisciplined study environment. 

It is understandable why some people have voiced their concern over the act of students being able to judge their own teachers. To them, doing so means teachers and students are on equal terms, which can trigger the rebellious side in the latter and they may make comments full of animosity directed at their teachers, which is undoubtedly a sign of disrespect. In addition, some are afraid that teachers being judged might lose their authority, which can be an opportunity for delinquents at school to wreak havoc and cause trouble. Nevertheless, I believe these problems can be dealt with if there is proper regulation about student comments. For instance, any feedback without solid evidence or one showing prejudice can be disregarded when evaluating the performance of teachers.

On the other hand, I concur that having students give presumably constructive comments can be advantageous to the educational system as a whole. The key rationale is that teachers and instructors are presented with a chance to self-reflect, which means they might adopt a more student-centred approach while teaching. To illustrate, some teachers in international schools in Vietnam have chosen a facilitator style in class, after comments from students and parents. Even with the controversy this might raise, like shattering teacher’s self-esteem and causing them to quit; or the fact that graduate students might become reluctant when applying for a teaching role in view of the uneasy feeling of being judged, I believe that a teacher that is willing to change to strive for the better would be an invaluable asset to the education system.

To conclude, even though some people are against feedback and comments on teachers with the fear of losing discipline in class, I still support this idea, as it can really help teachers hone their teaching skills, benefitting the system in the long run. If there are some schools that are still adamant about this initiative, I suggest that they can use questionnaires first, before reverting back to written comments.",10,8.5
"Some human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem; however, others think effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","As the impact of issues caused by human activities such as deforestation has become palpable to a great number of flora and fauna, species protection has become one of humanity's chief objectives in the 21st century. Although it is believed that tackling this issue would be pointless as no solutions will prove to be effective, I strongly opine that several feasible measures can be taken to alleviate it. 

On the one hand, that reversing the damage done to flora and fauna is a massive, impractical undertaking is justifiable to a certain extent. Most of the ongoing problems are the direct result of deforestation and pollution caused by non-stop economic activities. On such grounds, given the context of an increasing global population and the higher demands for land and products, in no way can humankind consent to reduce their economic growth. Not to mention that the extinction process is still happening at an incredibly quick rate, causing disruptions to the natural food chains, accelerating the extinction rate of other living creatures due to the domino effects, and eventually making it even faster than the speed of human interventions. Therefore, it would be impossible to slacken such a process. 

On the other hand, while a complete restoration of past conditions is unfeasible, measures can be taken to mitigate threats to animals and plants. First and foremost, more wildlife reserves and sanctuaries can be constructed in order to provide protection from illegal hunting. This can also act as a gene pool for scientists to preserve the engendered being' genetic material, lessening the possibility of complete extinction. Additionally, when the existence of endangered creatures is threatened, being able to isolate healthy, unaffected individuals for breeding is now getting an additional technological boost. For example, with the advent of technology, scientists are now using high-tech gene sequencing machines in an all-out effort to save the Tasmanian devil from an infectious disease that is threatening to wipe out the species. 

In conclusion, despite the seemingly impossible reality of conserving natural creatures, I firmly believe that it is still plausible to compensate for the environmental damage and preserve the existence of plants and animals.",9,8.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this ? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The significant growth of consumer products manufacturing has led to more detrimental effects on the natural environment. I believe that there are several root causes and solutions to address this issue will be proposed. 

To begin with, the consumerism culture of today’s society has caused more harm to wildlife habitats for two main reasons, including the industrial emission from the production process and packaging waste from the goods disposal. Wastes and pollutants discharged from the manufacturing process are unavoidable by-products. In fact, factory machines are generally powered by fossil fuels, for this reason, carbon-dioxide will be released which might severely pollute the surrounding air. Furthermore, product packaging assembled from plastic and paper needs a longer time to degrade naturally. As a result, it could end up contaminating the oceans, rivers, lakes, and what is even more dangerous is the fact that it could seriously endanger the inhabitants when the waste is accidentally swallowed.

Several actions should be prompted in order to mitigate the problem. Firstly, the government should take a bold move to impose a stricter law on sustainable manufacturing process and waste-management. To do so, the government can regulate the use of renewable energies to replace fossil fuels as well as encourage the utilization of low-energy-consumption machines. Secondly, to reduce unnecessary waste from product packaging, the consumer goods companies need to use an eco-friendly material which is considerably more compostable, for example, packaging made from plant-based resources such as corn and wheat straw.

To sum up, waste caused by the production of consumer goods is unavoidable, therefore comprehensive actions from the government and companies are needed to alleviate the problems immediately in order to conserve and protect the natural environment.",4,5.5
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this contemporary epoch, there is a widely held perception that free early-year education enables developing countries to boost their economic status. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, I totally agree with this opinion because this will impact positively upon the labour market and people's level of awareness. 2 of the primary reasons why I totally agree with that notion will be further elaborated. 

To embark on, despite the fact that a completely free primary education could be a hectic procedure, I firmly believe that this will pour into the benefit of the economy. This means that when authorities subsidise  primary schools, students will become skilled professionals in various industrial aspects in the short term because these promising workers will have all the basic skills to comprehend efficiently. An eminent example of this is Japan where the government allocated a substantial proportion of their budget to primary schools, and they reaped the benefits in terms of high-tech companies such as Nokia and Samsung.

Further and even more importantly, though, investing in early educational levels plays a quintessential role in societies. In other words, if youth enjoy a well-rounded basic level of learning, they will have the ability to expel erroneous thoughts and extremism such as addiction and drug dealing. This can be witnessed in Egypt where crime rates have dramatically declined after the awareness-raising campaigns launched by the Egyptian government calling for erasing illiteracy and motivating Egyptians of different ages to participate.

In conclusion, not only does a free-of-charge educational process yield highly qualified professionals, but also this initiative empowers societies with a high level of awareness. Thus, I am convinced that without such an option, nations could not have been able to combat low-economic standards.",6,6.5
It is important for all towns and cities to have large outdoor public spaces such as squared and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It has been frequently argued that urban areas ought to keep space for playgrounds or public parks. I completely agree with the statement as it could bring ample benefits to the life of dwellers and the same would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, if all cities would construct beautiful gardens, specifically for each area, it could have the following benefits. Initially, parks or grounds, which  have been maintained properly with flowers and trees would provide the best view. Consequently, they could visit frequently there and get relief from mental stress and fatigue for the whole day. Besides,  these places are merely sources of fresh air in developed areas as most of these areas are covered with buildings and roads. For instance, the harmful gases or the pollution exhausted by vehicles could be purified by planting trees since they consume carbon dioxide and exhale fresh air that is oxygen in surroundings, subsequently, inhabitants could consume fresh air.

Furthermore, human beings could utilise public parks for spending quality time and it is useful for them in plenty of ways. Firstly, children could play outdoor sports on a daily basis and it would provide a plethora of advantages to their health. For example, in concrete areas, they could barely enjoy as they have to play video games or operate electronic gadgets in their  spare time, whereas, open places would encourage them to play. Apart from this, adults could go for morning and evening walks, therefore, they could get relief from health problems.

In conclusion, if councils would provide space and build gardens for dwellers, it could provide them with many benefits and they could lead a healthy and happy life.",5,6.0
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that employees should be forced to comply with a specific dress code or it is their outcome that matters. Personally, while I agree that the way of dressing should be considered as an irrelevant factor in many workplaces, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reasons in some professions.

On the one hand, staff's productivity is much more important than how their appearance is. If employees have been restricted to a certain regulation related to clothing, they might not feel that much freedom to produce creativity. For example, there is a furniture company in my hometown which is famous for its avangard design not determining any dress code to curb its staff. Moreover, by introducing any form of dressing, workers might lose the chance to present their personality to their co-workers and that company therefore would not have a progressive, positive atmosphere to boost applicability.

However, it has been proved that in some careers dress codes are effective factors. Firstly, a certain, well-known uniform can provoke a feeling of trustworthiness in people's hearts. For instance, we would not rely on a fireman or a police officer if they did not dress up in their specific uniforms. Secondly, in some places like hospitals certain clothes are not only pivotal to cleanness but also inform people of data like how they are talking to whom they should refer to by their differences. Finally, similarities in the way of dressing could lead to a sense of unity in any company. 

In conclusion, Although the performance of workers is vital to employers and dress codes should not be forced, I believe that there are still positive aspects of following dress regulations.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the houses or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","The interest of some societies in discovering  the story hidden beneath the history of their home, is growing day by day. There are several reasons which tell us why people are curious about the history of their accommodations.

The reasons for the curiosity of individuals about historical eras  could be about the tradition, culture and  religion of those who had lived previously where they are residing now, which could be amusing to know about. In addition, some people are eager to know about the historical evidence of their living environment such as  gathering data about climate change or why people in ancient eras had decided to construct buildings in the area. Following this, some places and buildings have their own horrific history. For example, some of them were hunted or  each of the family members who used to live in a specific building had died because of a mysterious reason.

Individuals can enhance their knowledge about the history of the places through searching browsers, such as Google on the internet, where people can find millions of results about what they are looking for. Also, local libraries would have more documented data, like old newspapers and journals about the area where individual lives. Moreover, asking from elderly of the region could be another way of discovering  some historical places. 

In conclusion, significant members of many societies, who have several questions about the place where they live, because for several reasons they have, could find the answer by searching through the internet or local journals.",8,7.5
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is widely acknowledged that living with  other people is not related to media, therefore following the news content probably is not necessary for our living. In this essay, the advantages and disadvantages of news following will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

In this day and age, media has disrupted our human activity and it was more convenient to access the sources of the press or broadcasting on the different channels. First of all, the most important benefit of following the news is being well-prepared, according to natural disasters, television or radio would take the main part for announcing important notes for the disaster controlling policy. A further advantage is an updated trend, people could follow the economic, healthcare, and community-living situations from the news on each kind of platform. Moreover, enjoying entertainment content is one of the beneficial advantages of staying connected with televisions, radio broadcasting or focusing on any kind of media presentation.

However, there are some drawbacks of unreliable sources in watching the news or content that has been published on the screen or even in tabloids. For example; in a criminal issue, children should watch these news headlines or an inside story  with their parental guidance. Another drawback of media is a wrong influence from fake news and some propaganda and they just prefered to find more advantages for the audiences. 

In conclusion, there are some advantages to keeping up with the trends by following the news, but it is very important to perceive the contents from only reliable sources. Otherwise, fake news or fraud will lead to a negative outcome for the audience or the readers. Consequently, in the youth or children age group , they should particularly watch  the t.v. under parental consideration and screening.",7,7.0
"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
In conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future.",4,5.5
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Nowadays, most people have a huge intention to explore the story behind the accommodation they live in. This essay will explain the reason for this phenomenon and describe how the way public finds it out.

First of all, people are looking for the background of the place where they stay due to the recent issues about the land conflicts. This is simply because some citizens are not clever enough to deal with the right area seller, which is sometimes a swindler; as a result,  later problems such as building destruction might happen. That is why society starts to search for their house’s natural history. In addition, humans tend to be scared about the myths storey of any place, especially their own house; therefore, they choose to explore the fact behind their place and its surroundings to fulfil their curiosity. 

In terms of researching history, one of the most common ways to do this is by asking the former residents about the actual past story about the building. They can help to share brief information whether the house is safe or not. Furthermore, we can check out the legality of the documents of the building or the estate we stay on to make sure there will be no controversy regarding the land in the future. These would help us to live peacefully without any doubt or fear.

In conclusion, some people recently have the ambition to find out the history of their house to prevent any problem in the future and live more peacefully. The method usually used for this is asking the previous habitant and checking the essential documents of the building and area.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by  artificial intelligence robots.

What is  your opinion?","It is considered that an enormous amount of jobs are going to be taken over by artificial intelligence robots. Although a huge number of jobs will be replaced by bots, there are certain jobs where these will accelerate productivity. This essay discusses the rise in performance at the workplace.

On the one hand side, most jobs are at risk because of artificial intelligence. All those jobs where processes are predefined and monotonous in nature are already replaced by bots while others are going to be in the near future. For instance, cashier and accountant roles are already eradicated by auto teller machines and sophisticated software solutions. Moreover, they provide instant services 24 hours a day and seven days a week without any break and extra cost in terms of services. Hence, machines are rapidly capturing the workplace.

On the other hand side, humans became more productive after the emergence of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence technology. Since it provides rapid responses to problems, task execution is much more effective now. To illustrate, gathering ideas for the brainstorming and logic building is no more a hassle. Code can be written and troubleshooted in a short time period. Prototypes would be prepared and evolved effectively. Thus, machines are enhancing the abilities of employees and providing them ease in performing there tasks at the earliest.

In conclusion, definitely, most jobs will be performed by robots. Obviously not only there will be a huge cut in the workforce, but there will be much improvement in terms of the performance of the personnel.  Infact, with the convinience of bots effective productivity is inevitable which could not possible otherwise.",5,6.0
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession.
What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many students upon completion of their studies contend that their unable to find an occupation relevant to their chosen field. In my opinion, ,,currently this is a major issue for the students as they become unemployed after they are out of university. 

First of foremost, after school examinations many students fail to research  the trending occupations relevant to each industry without receiving or gathering more information regarding the preferred job, ,,instead they choose the wrong path. Evidence in this matter, an individual who completed her studies in Civil Engineering, has no job opportunities in Sri Lanka. The rationale behind this is that  the chosen occupation is mainly on demand for males than females. Therefore, she then intends to attend university to obtain another qualification for a job that is well in demand such as a marketing course, as certain employers focus on marketing qualifications which additionally consumes time to complete a course. 

As a solution to the stated issue, in my point of view prior to enrolling on a program best option for the individual is to do research on the preferred field. Furthermore, when selecting a course seek  universities that support candidates to find jobs, evidence in this matter is an internship, which helps the student to pursue his/ her chosen career thereafter extend their career and gain the required experience. This will encourage and fascinate the individual to do the best of his/ her ability without facing any problems.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned the above solution can be measured accurately which then will be less challenging for the student to face unemployment in the future when applying for jobs, without any hesitation.",6,6.5
Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"It is quite popular to see that people have changed the way of communication with the advancement in technology, and ready to explore various news from the different part of world. While I genuinely accept that this statement have few considerable drawbacks, I still claim that it is constructive approach due to several benefits. 

There are two main disadvantages of this approach, and the prominent one is lack of accurate resources. This is because when people acquire from internet, and people are more likely to have a wrong information from the social media. To illustrate, turkey news channel have conveyed the fake data about the people who have actually died during the earth quake.  Apart from this, media apps are not that effective to know anyone’s emotions about how and what they feel. This is due the reason about lack of emotions while people talk over the phones and use other apps such as facebook, Snapchat and many more. 

However, I would argue that the demerits of acquiring information from internet are outweighed by the merits. Firstly, everyone can talk to each other from every part of the globe with the help of internet. This is owing to the factor that there are some apps that are helping people to connect with other on video and audio call. For instance, facebook is an app that can add multiple people, and it watch around the near and dear ones about where and how they are. Secondly, in terms of news, people are not over- dependent on the newspapers and magazines since they can simple use their fingers on the touch pad to know anything happening. 

In conclusion, It seems to me that the potential upsides of using internet in order to know connect to people, and getting news with social media are more significant than the possible dangers.",4,5.5
"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","With the advent of technology, nowadays it is common to save knowledge on the Internet instead of books or notebooks which were main means in the past. In this essay, I will examine how the merits of storing knowledge on the Internet outweigh its demerits.

There are several detrimental aspects of using the Internet to keep knowledge. First and foremost, it is necessary to buy a digital device which people can use such as cloud computing services. Owing to the high cost of the device, people might find it a burden to afford it. Furthermore, the usage of electronic devices can lead to detrimental effects on the user’s body. For instance, people’s eyes are more likely to be strained while they are staring at a monitor. What is worse, they can be exposed to electromagnetic waves from computers or mobiles.

Despite those disadvantages mentioned above, there are significant advantages of using the Internet as a storage. Firstly, it is definitely easy to access knowledge on the web storage without any geographical constraints. Besides, people are able to find their files from their laptops and mobiles wherever they want to use them. In addition to this, the process of sharing their knowledge to others is just simple and quick. What is more, it is cost effective in a long term as people do not have to buy a lot of books, pens and even shelves to store a substantial amount of knowledge.

In conclusion, even though storing knowledge on the Internet brings some adverse effects in terms of the budget to buy expensive devices and users’ health problems, there are clear virtues such as accessibility and convenience. Therefore, as for the purpose of the storage, using the Internet is better than the old way.",6,6.5

Although some people do not agree, I believe that it is essential for towns and cities to have these spaces.

On the one hand, there are some arguments that cities and towns having common areas are unnecessary. Firstly, those areas can be replaced with useful facilities such as hospitals, car parks and subway stations. As a result, those facilities provide convenience to citizens. For example, people easily receive medical care at accessible local hospitals. Secondly, there is a safety issue particularly during night time. Especially parks can become risky environments after dark, often attracting homeless individuals. Due to this, many people tend to avoid parks during the night.

On the other hand, in my view, I am more convinced that having those spaces can encourage exercise and physical activity among residents. This means that exercise maintains good health and reduces the risk of diseases such as obesity and heart conditions. When individuals exercise in their daily routine, they improve their physical abilities, strengthen their muscles, and prevent weight gain. In addition, these public spaces have the potential to attract tourists and visitors. As tourists explore the local areas, they contribute to the local economy by spending money on nearby restaurants, cafes and shops.

In conclusion, some individuals argued that large public spaces are unnecessary in our cities but I believe that despite the concerns about safety at night, large public spaces in towns and cities offer numerous benefits.",8,7.5
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"With the development of technology, artificially intelligent robots have started to take over many jobs that previously done by humans. While I believe that most jobs will eventually be done by robots, some jobs will still need a human touch, and therefore cannot be replaced. This essay will discuss this topic in details.

Robots are more likely to occupy mundane jobs that require less decision-making process. Teaching a machine with artificial intelligence to follow an algorithm costs less than training and hiring human labour, thus this will be beneficial for the employers in a long term. For example, automated machines are now widely used in factories for the jobs that do not require a complex set of skills. Moreover, they can work faster and more efficiently than hundreds of employees, resulting in the increased productivity of the factory. For these reasons, robots will progressively replace humans in the workforce.

On the other hand, there are several jobs that are unlikely to be replaced by robots. These types of jobs usually require a specific set of skills that is too difficult to achieve even by the most sophisticated form of artificial intelligence. Take medicine as an example, until now there is no smart computer that can accurately diagnose and prescribe a treatment to patients without the help of a trained doctor. Therefore, some jobs will still exclusively performed by humans.

To sum up, I believe that artificially intelligent robots will definitely substitute humans in the majority of fields. However, there are few jobs that will still be carried out by people because they require human contact.",5,6.0
"Some people think that museums should be an enjoyable place to entertain people. While others believe the purpose of the museum is to educate. 
Discus both views & give your own opinion","In this modern era, few masses think that museums  thought applies enjoyable places to entertain the community. But others believe the purpose of the museum is to educate. In my opinion, the former notion has several elements that deserve attention and I will explain its views in the upcoming paragraph thus will lead to a logical conclusion.

There are myriad applied arguments in favour of my context, and the most conspicuous one lies in the fact that people should be extra careful with their decisions. For example, according to a recent survey done by Stanford University, 45per cent of the masses take benefit from the above-mentioned notion, whereas 30per cent of the population faces demerits due to it. Hence, it is apparent why many citizens are in favour of the above stance.

Another argument in support of my view is that communities worldwide have become more active in dealing with this situation. To illustrate, as per apply academic research carried out by the Australian government, 60per cent of society gained immensely from the museums. They improved their existing scenario tremendously and that paved the way for a better economic future. Therefore, not only will this make the public more careful and pragmatic in their approach, but also it will lead to a better living standard.

Before hammering the last nail, one can conclude that museums should be applied enjoyable places to entertain the public. While others believe the purpose of the museum is to educate.",5,6.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that playing team sports at school is the best way to teach children to cooperate. In this , an essay I shall explore both sides of this opinion and then give my judgement to what extent I agree or disagree.

Many believe that team sports are an effective way for a child to learn that cooperation and good communication are the keys to success when working together as a team. For example, many team sports, such as football and basketball, require effective communication and coordination between the whole team if they wish to win the game. Furthermore, this cooperation is taught in a manner which is fun and exciting to the child. Sports are just another form of playing games to children and therefore they often learn very valuable skills whilst also having a lot of fun at the same time.

Yet, some people disagree and are worried that sports place a very high value on athleticism and competitive nature, thus for children who are not athletic or competitive team sports may, in fact, be a discouraging activity. One which they do not enjoy and thus is unlikely to produce good results. Furthermore, there are some children who may suffer from disabilities or illness which inhibits their ability to play sports. Therefore, it is very important that there are other effective methods to teach cooperation at school.

In conclusion, I believe that both sides of the argument have their merit. However, the fact that not all children are able to engage in team sports or enjoy them is a very detrimental factor to its effectiveness in teaching children to cooperate. Therefore, I think it is important to consider other methods which may also be effective in teaching children to cooperate.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the world is on the cutting edge of globalisation, environmental issues are increasing day by day. So the pollution to the ecosystem is varied in numerous. Accordingly, some of the population withhold that increasing the prices of fuel for automated cars and other vehicles will solve environmental problems, but according to my point of view, I completely agree with the above statement. The following essay will outline my points with examples. 

Air pollution is the significant problem around the globe  because many countries are suffering from the consequences of the issue. While it is evident that increasing the fuel prices will reduce  pollution, because few vehicles will be on the road and there will be less pollution. To exemplify, Singapore has increased the tax rates of new vehicles so that there will be fewer buyers and the air pollution throughout the country will slightly reduce. 

However, there are other methods to solve this problem as well. One of the methods is to increase the usage of public transport, make  people aware of  air pollution and its harmful effects on humans and reduce the fair prices of public transport vehicles, so that  people will use more of them, moreover as there are a limited amount of public vehicles like trams, trains and buses  if the government increase the transport method the pollution of biodiversity will be reduced in the upcoming years. As an example, London has a huge metro train system, which is quite affordable and people prefer to use public transport instead of personal vehicles. 

To sum up, environmental pollution can be reduced by increasing the price of gasoline,subsequently there are other methods such as imposing taxes to brand new vehicles and using public vehicles that will combat the issue.",6,6.5
Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle material and avoid waste. Other believe that should be taught at home. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many people think that child should be taught in school to recycle unused material, while others say that this training should be given at home. This article will discuss both views before a final statement.

First, the people who hold the notion that universities are responsible for educating students to make most of their time can claim that it is the professors who are capable of imparting this knowledge. There is no doubt that the teachers who, at the proper level, can tell the students and the adolescent about the advantages of reprocessing material and the disadvantages of not using waste, which even pollutes the environment. For example, in international level schools like DPS, teachers use a variety of graphs and pictures to give a demonstration to younger ones so that they can understand each and every aspect of recycling with the help of visuals and put it into practice in their life.

Despite the fact that some schools are putting efforts to enhance the knowledge of adolescents in reusing non-usable items, Parents encourage their teenagers also. It is generally observed and true that worthless goods such as plastic items, cardboard items, are also found most at home, which has ceased to be used. Therefore, parents ought to help their adolescent in understanding , how to recycle this material by illustrations. As a result, juvenile's awareness of the subject will increase, and they will be more aware of reusing such junk at an early age.

To sum up, I understand that although a number of people argue that the whole responsibility for a child's mental development regarding recycling lies with the school, I think schools and families may work together for a better future for their children.",9,8.0
Some people say that advertising has positive economic effects. Others think it has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Advertising is more significant progress in the economy.Thus the ad gives information about products to customers. While some people believe  that advertising has positive economic effects, others strongly recommend that this has negative social effects. This essay discuss both these  views in support of the latter.

On the one hand, it can be said that advertising more dangerous for human , because the most people see products and then they will buy,  next period of time that outputs impact to the health. Nevertheless, wrong ad is  create  by falsificator  onto  the internet and this processing is harmfull for population. Another disadvantage is that improving using in the wrong direction by villain.  For example, every year the media companies give data about harmfull crops and that situation is causing death thousand of people. In the meantime goverments will do precaution and give attention on the field.

On the other hand, I would side with those argue that positive effect then advertising has helping to the economy. Certain a commercial business need ad,  for the reason they are an increase income by advertising, moreover the crops reach large crowd of people. For instance, each organizations desire high percent of revenue , in addition using  the ad. The investigation based of the  information all companies utulize ad and next a decade that will be more.

In conclusion, advertising has both positive and negative effects so, this condition give benefit for organization but if they must be careful and wright  way. I hope latter years government is more awarenees on this area.",5,6.0
"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","For the time being, that the government’s coffer splurges on exploring space has never failed to provoke controversial debates among people. Some claim that space exploration the money goes into is not reliable while the administrations can splurge their funds in other fields. I would contend that while this thinking is valid to some certain extent, the governors should invest harmoniously in space exploration and other aspects to bring a better life for people.

Without a shadow of a doubt, allocating finance in researching the space should be taken into keener consideration because of some tremendous benefits it brings. Due to a population boom, people have an ever-increasing demand for accommodation to live while the source of land has a strict limit. Finding out other spaces to handle this dire issue is of importance for the governors to expand the size of living area. For example, the recent report of some scientists searching for a homogenous planet with the same living conditions as the Earth's, namely Mars, has lightened the hopes of us in a new destination. Hence, it is undeniable that uncovering the mystery of space is a worthy aspect for the government to spend money on.

While some redeeming features of focusing financially on the space industry are widely acknowledged, there are still other fields for the government to prioritize their coffers such as the healthcare system. Due to its backbone position in the nation’s prosperity and its low-standard facilities, the government needs to splurge money on providing more top-notch amenities and researching for new medicines to revamp the physical health of citizens. This not only creates a robust generation to serve as a labor workforce for the country but also diminishes the high toll of death in current society. For example, Vietnam in the past few years has invested in the medical system by buying vaccines and operating machines to assist the whole nation fight against the COVID19 pandemic. Undisputedly, the governors should contribute their financial abilities to the health development.

To sum up, although space exploration has brought various positive merits, other aspects such as the medical industry still play an imperative role in making the country better. Because of that, the government should equally divide their money into all fields to take the most of their efficiencies.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.


Do you agree or disagree?","Securing a well-paid career is everyone's dream. There are some people who think that it is better to be graduated  from a tertiary institution in order to be employed while others advocate that start working immediately after  elementary learning is paramount. In my opinion, the higher degree gives an upper hand to have  reputed employment since this already proves that the candidate is sufficiently equipped to work in a particular post.

 The first and foremost fact is that when a job seeker with degree certificates would more likely to be  hired as a person who has thorough knowledge in that field, when compared to one who just passed secondary school. In other words,  education itself shows  how efficient this potential employee is. For example,  many international companies, their deployment is purely based on the academic background. Therefore, this can be harmful to those who have  only basic learning.

Another fact is that even though it is possible to secure a job with  minimum education, future career development can be slim since they did not  have theoretical background. Similarly, the pay increment also based on the position which they are in, it is unlikely to be counted  the number of years they are in the field. The class-four worker, for instance, has many years of experience, but there is a huge difference in salary of his and a newly hired manager of the same organisation. Thus,  advancement is  strictly dealt with the level of qualifications.

In conclusion, people have a different opinion on whether joining in a work-sector after a basic study or  to be graduated before searching an occupation. I firmly think that a highly qualified job seeker can secure a better position than others.  It is highly recommended that if you are planned to develop through a  position, higher training is a must.",8,7.5
"Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus.
Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","Certain educational institutes provide a distance learning scheme through online studies of curiculum courses which can be an alternate way of institutional studies, which can be taught in the university's premises. I personally reckon that rendering online study has good and bad aspects, which I can explicate in the following paragraphs through some practical examples.

To begin with, the first and foremost beneficial outcome of the online studies is that it confers the great opportunity to teach myriad of students from every corner of the world, which can be delivered at any time, anywhere, and any condition. This can be simplified by saying that on campus studies 

can be taught on the particular time and at the same place which is specially a classroom study. For illustration, in order to provide an education in this pandemic situation, there are the numerous universities who use digital platform to continue their studies through various intermediate platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Furthermore, due to such development we see reducation in usage of fossil fuel consumptions, which can improve the quality of air in our environment. 

On the other hand, distance learning has the certain shortcomings which can not underestimate by scholars and techears. Firstly, scholars believe that there are plenty of distration come when pursuing study through online mode, which can be reduced the focus of class, hence the pupils can not concertrate during the lectures. For instance, there are the few cases where learners encounter background noises which drop their attention from the study. Secondly, some education providers say that sometimes students just join the class for showing their availability. Such as, students do other recreational activities when their classes are running, just putting their audio on mute and disable their video so that they do whatever they want during their live classes. Finally, online studies rerequisite the internet connection and other gadgets like laptop, microphone and camera, which make the online study a little expensive, and this development become costly for economically deprived people. 

To conclude, online study is one of the best way to learn students from anywhere without going to the university's campus but I think every development has the negative aspects. Hence, online study can not be change the way of classes which deliver on campus earlier.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested  in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons  for this? How can people research this?","In recent years, there has been a trend in some countries where people increased their curiosity towards uncovering the history of the house or building they live in. This essay will discuss reasons of the trend and discuss methods that can be used for research.

There are different reasons for this matter. One such reason can be the wish of deeper understanding of the origin of houses. People can feel an emotional people connection with a place they live in. That is especially reasonable for people who know family line well and got a house by inheritance. Another reason is exploring the important history behind the house. For example, that is a popular plot development in paranormal movies when characters unclose what is on with them and their surroundings.  The other reason can be finding out the construction and the level of deterioration with a goal to renovate and escape destruction of the house.

There are different ways to research the history of a home. The easiest way is to ask old neighbors what they know and witnessed from the time living in the area. Other sources refer to local archives, libraries, and government institutions. They should have the amount of notes, documents, and different data about a house. Some information can be found in the Internet forums of local enthusiasts.

"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","It is true that youngsters are considered the building blocks of a nation and they play a vital role in serving the society as they are full of energy not only mentally but physically also. some people think that youth should do voluntary work for the community in their free time as it will be beneficial for both of them. I agree with the statement as it has wide range of benefits which will be discussed in the further essay.
On the one hand, adolescents can do a lot of unpaid activities and make their spare time a fruitful one. Firstly, they can teach underprivileged children as they are unable to afford the school education. This in turn help the youngsters to gain a lot of experience and help them in future perspective. Secondly, youth can involve in some philanthropic activities by cleaning their localities and planting trees, this helps them to become responsible towards society and enhance their social skills.
On the other hand, some disagree teenagers should do unpaid work. One reason is that the mounting pressure our education system puts on studying for exams leaves little time for students to pursue other activities. After school, homework and revision takes priority which leaves no time for other things. Another important factor is that youngsters like to have free time to develop their hobbies and interest. These voluntary works would eat up their free time.
In conclusion, despite having certain drawbacks of education pressure and lack free time to improve their extra-curricular activities, I strongly agree voluntary work would help teenagers to a greater extent in long run. This would help them to understand the importance of hard work, team building, social bonding and make them a better person. Both parents and teachers should encourage teens to take part in serving the community in free time.",3,5.0
"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.
What are the reasons for this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","Schools play an important role in the development of our brains. Nowadays a large number ofstudent feel that it is hard to concentrate and they are not able to give their full attention in school. In this essay, I will outline what is the potential reasons for this particular problem and what we can do to resolve

 this.

There is  a lot of reasons that Student are not able to concentrate in school, the major reason is 

smartphone with social media. Obviously, when these kids use Smartphones they not only watch 

videos online but also waste a lot of time on social media. As a result, they lose their concentration which hinders their close attention. for instance, a study has concluded that everyone these days has 

problem with concentration cause they are spending a lot of time in front of the mobile screen. Another reason is that nowadays these juveniles are very enthusiastic, they want to get everything in their life very early. therefore, instead of living in present with the full ,attention they waste their precious time thinking about the future.  

On the other hand, to resolve these problems public and the government both should have to perform their duties otherwise it will be a disaster for the student in future. To resolve this problem parents need to keep eye on their kids and let them know that they should not spend their precious time spending on scrolling Facebook and Instagram. government should work with these social media companies and make some restrictions on using these platforms.  

In conclusion, despite the ubiquity of mobile phones, if parents and government take stick action against social media applications they can do great care of their children and citizen.",3,5.0
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Cooperation among children is the first step to being a model citizen and a nice person. It is essential to learn to cooperate since childhood to improve this comportment's key and for somebody is crucial to learn it at school, especially in a team sport. In this essay, I will argue why I moderately agree with this view.

It is common knowledge, that sport at school represents one of the most beneficial activities for children, one of the ways why it is functional is because of the significant lessons that you can find out only by playing, for example, cooperation. Young boys can define a goal for the match or even the training and reach it in an easier way if they do it together. Sometimes at school, conflicts born among students and sometimes they can be resolved with a little bit of cooperation spirit during a basketball or a football game.

There are also alternative methods to teach how to cooperate at school like using, in general, cooperative learning or proposing team research or games. Use at is well cooperative learning means, consolidating the class which has to listen to each member's opinion and answer in a polite way and without any tension. Another advantage is the presence of the tutor, this figure can help students with more difficulties, and because of the inexistent lack of years in comparison to a teacher, the kid could feel better with the explanation.

To conclude, this essay argued why it is true that having a team sport at school can help to cooperate but I definitely do not think this is the best way ever, because there are other modes with which achieve a cooperative action.",6,6.5
"It is common for people to travel long distance for work and study.some argue that longer commute times affect people in a negative way while others disagree.

Discuss the both views and give ypur opinion.","Even though the people are very busy within their jobs as well as studies, they may experience a longer commute time.some people state that travelling long distance for work or study brings negative effects on them while others holding the opposite idea.In my point of view, it depends on the outcome of one's career commitment.In this essay, both views will be analysed to draw a conclusion.

On one hand, most people struggling to make their goals realistic despite of the challenges they face.For example , as good parenthood, people try to attend their children to school in cities rather than in country side in order to provide them a student friendly environment and better facilities for education.Also people immigrate to town area for services like supermarkets, health care, shopping complexes and pubic libraries regardless the time they consume to reach and return.Moreover, individuals who concern their carrier, try to identify more trends than issues in their job field and promotions as well.As a result,though the public spend long duration in travelling,they recieve better outcome for their commitment in return.

On the other hand,longer commute time cause more stress in people.For instance, if somone faced a traffic jam on the way to his job, he mentally  struggles with the time taken to reach the work place.This cause him an emotional damage.As well, when returning home, everybody  wish to arrive early to their destination and women reschedule the rest of the day for house hold dutoes and plans for tomorrow. If it takes much time to travel, people may get tired easily and fedup with household activities.This is an emotional burden.

To sum up, apart from the mental disturbances, most of the public manage all those tasks enthusiastically  to achieve their goals.Therefore, long commute times do not always negatively impact the community. However, if the distribution of resources takes place with equal strength across society and if globalization positively affects rural areas as well, a better tomorrow will emerge.",1,4.0
"Interviews form the basic selecting criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that the interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed by some experts that the interview is the main factor by which an employee should get a chance to work in an organization. However, Some are against this perception and think that this is not the only way of selecting an individual, there can be other reliable methods by which the workforce can be chosen. I agree with the latter view to some extent.

There are myriad reasons why an employer finds an interview to be the best way among all other alternatives. Firstly, It includes face-to-face interaction with the person which can benefit the employer in understanding the real potential of people. Secondly, It is helpful in accessing the traits related to their personality, especially, their communication skills which are necessary for an employee to work in any department. In addition to it, an interviewer can judge the mental ability of the humans by providing them with the tasks related to their capability.

Apart from this, It is also believed by companies that it assists them in hiring the right person in comparison to other competitive exams. For instance, It might be possible that a person with a good academic result is not able to perform a particular task, therefore, resulting in lower productivity.Furthermore, It is not possible to ensure the correctness of the details mentioned in the curriculum vitae by the candidate in other selection forms. 

Although It has various advantages which overweigh the disadvantages yet I believe that there should be a mix of both terminologies in order to appoint a worker in a company. There are some jobs which did not require personal skills, such as these are not mandatory for the post of a computer operator. Only written and theoretical knowledge is enough to fill the vacancy for this post.

To sum up, I would like to reiterate that if I consider it logically then I believe there are some jobs for which there is no need to conduct an interview. So, it is wise to say that firms should use a combination of these terms depending upon the requirement of a particular position when selecting an employee.",10,8.5
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","It is widely known that immense vehicles on the roadway, particularly in huge and prominent cities, causing various problems afterwards such as air pollution, disturbing noise to households, and accidents on the streets have become a serious issue these days. There are abundant factors why these phenomena happen. Therefore, in this essay, I will explain the causes as well as the possible solutions for this issue.

To begin with, as traffics congestions mostly occur  downtown, one of the reasons for this  occurrence is lacking  entertainment facilities especially in the countryside and suburbs such as department stores, theatres, and amusement parks. For instance, it is undeniable that  some countries only have these entertainment facilities in eminent cities. That means whenever people in other provinces desire to go to a site like that they have to go to that famous towns also causing heavy traffic there later. In addition, some cities have poor public transportations making citizens in that cities select to drive private automobiles or motorbikes because of the convenience rather than using inferior public transports. As a result, there will be numerous vehicles on the roadway.

Nevertheless, this phenomenon can be resolved with the assist of the national government. The first sensible solution is the government must improve public transportations in order to subside the amount of the car on the roadway. If these public transports are easily available, extensive to various places, and low price, most populations will choose to use them more than cars or motorbikes. Furthermore, the government should generate new media centres in the different regions except for downtowns. Thus, citizens do not have to go   downtown; instead, they are able to find entertainment facilities in their own cities.

In conclusion, the massive amount of automobiles on the avenue has many causes such as poor transportations as well as lacking  facilities. However, this occurrence can be corrigible by the aiding of the national administration to improve public transports and construct more new entertainment facilities in other zones.",7,7.0
"The use of social media ,such as Face book and Twitter ,is replacing face_to_face contact with people. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","It is often said that the usage of social media such as Facebook and Twitter in people's life is substituted by face_to_face contact with most humans. I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact. 

Firstly ,one of the conspicuous advantages of social media is the speed of people's activities. For example ,at stake ,the public should wait for making an appointment with an expert to conduct their projects ,however, at the moment they can search for essential information that they need to do their works quickly by merely exploiting different types of social media such as ,YouTube. This would reduce the people's need for each other and create a noticeable speed in the works. Therefore ,this makes it clear that this would tackle the problem of the lack of time to carry out different subjects constructively.

However ,social media could cause multiple troubles. This would probably have many drawbacks. For instance ,most  people around the world tend to use social media for all activities such as connecting with friends online rather than visiting them.This would create a preference to reduce  communication among people in the society by just staying in the same place and keeping a certain distance from people. This could cause isolation in human life. Also, isolation could create one of the dangerous mental disorders in 21 century namely depression. As a result ,it becomes apparent that the downsides that social media has been generated in the world would be more than the benefits. 

To summarise ,social media's handicaps are definitely distinctive for people. They are greater and hazardous. It is predicted that our face_to_ face relationship will face the highest revolution by social media and will continue to remove in the near future",8,7.5
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think that the children’s parents should be punished instead.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is argued that youngsters should be restricted by the laws while others believe that this is parent responsibility. Although, in mi opinion, second view is reasonable.

 One the one hand, there are several reasons that lead people to believe that juvenile crime. One of them is that kids or teenagers need to be responible for what they have done, especially breaking the laws. Moreover, if the punishment applies to young people, they will remember and will not be reoffended. For example, criminals can use children to rob a bank, and the police will see the issue that the kid is breaking the rule. However, they will pass this problem because they are just children. 

 On the other hand, I strongly believe that in serious crimes parents should be punished instead because the child is not well educated about laws. Moreover,if the kids get involved in criminal activities, it is probably because the parents did not teach to their children distinguish white from black in government. Thus, the parents will have to be responsible and be compensated for what their child did. For instance, when child breaking the laws, it was already the parents job the teach them probably about good and bad thing to do.

 To conclude, youth crimes being punished can be justifiable in some aspects, yet I totally believe that parents should be taking the responsibility for their children's upbringing.",3,5.0
"The unlimited uses of cars may cause many problems. What are those problems?

In order to reduce this problem, should we discourage people to use cars?","People are preferring their own vehicles over public transportation and this development has rapidly increased in recent years. Several problems are being caused because of this such as environmental damage and consumption of natural resources. This issue can be tackled by shifting the trend towards public transportation and users can be made aware by informing the detrimental effects of personal car use.

Using private cars in large numbers is damaging the atmosphere and would eventually result in a lack of petroleum for upcoming generations. Firstly, vehicles release emissions of gases while running on roads which pollute the air. Especially diesel engines, for example, produce more harmful gases as compared to other technologies and as a result, people suffer from respiratory problems. Secondly, fuel is being used in extreme quantities to make these vehicles run. Therefore, the future people will face a lack of natural resources and would not be able to find them even for their appropriate use.

To prevent these problems, car owners should be discouraged to buy new vehicles and use them unless extremely necessary. Awareness can be spread among them with the help of data and surveys that are related to health and environmental problems caused by vehicles. They can be shown Ozone layer damages in the current years and predictions about the future if nothing would be done about this. In addition to this, public transportation needs to be made more accessible and cheaper to encourage people towards it. For instance, public sector employees at least can be provided with free facilities of transit. 

To conclude, the use and selling rate of cars, indubitably, has shown rapid growth in previous years. Environment and natural resources are directly affected by this approach, and efforts to avoid private machinery should be done at both the personal and government level.",10,8.5

Discuss advantages and disadvantages of this.","In the past, lots of house works were made manually but now, these jobs are done by technological devices.This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of this change.

   The two main advantages of the development of house machines are the fact that the community win a lot of time and also a lot of energy. Firstly, cleaning the residence takes more than 10 hours and ,if a robot can make this job, it saves people that time. For example, if I would have a robot vacuum cleaner, I will  not need to stay at all Saturday at home to clean the dirt. Secondly, having a machine to do all those condominium activities saves people energy too. They will not need to spend all their remained efficiency on cleaning.For instance, if a women come from work tired, instead of starting to clean the dishes, she just needs to turn on the dish-cleaning machine.

   However, those devices have also some disadvantages but also destroy the feeling of satisfaction and lose tradition. After cleaning the entire house, a woman feels satisfied and productive but, if a machine does this job, the feeling will not appear. Also, doing residence jobs like windows cleaning is a family tradition and having a device that does that can destroy that habit. an example would be a girl that cleans the windows with her mother every first day of the month.

   In conclusion, machines that do building jobs make people benefit from free time and more efficiency  but also make them less satisfied with their work and lose tradition.",10,8.5
Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Vehicles have caused enormous pollution in the cities as of late. Few Individuals opine, that the higher officials should shoot up the prices of fuel for automobiles and other commercial vehicles in order to solve problems of the environment. I agree that representatives of the country should raise the cost of both petrol and diesel to cope the effect of environmental contamination. 

Firstly, due to the increase in the population of the city, a lot of people are affording vehicles nowadays and the emissions from the cars is further creating air pollution which in turn is causing serious health problems to the citizens. Secondly, the roads are always congested with cars, buses, trucks in the city because the pavements are not quite wide. In addition, the contaminated substances are also emitted, by the industries  that is why there is a high percentage of those in the atmosphere.  For example, a survey report submitted by the Intelligence Bureau in Denmark, stated that about 75% of contamination in the air  was controlled after increasing the fares of fuel to a greater extent to tackle the issue of environmental safety.

In contrast, the ruling representatives of the kingdom should launch modern electric cars and bikes, which will help to eradicate the serious environmental damage to some extent. Furthermore, the level of emissions should be tested for all vehicles to ensure the safety of the surroundings. To illustrate, a survey report submitted by the agency stated in France, that there was about 95% reduction in air residuals after introducing non fuel vehicles.

To conclude, automobiles have caused enormous pollutants in all the metropolitan cities which is posing as a threat to our planet earth. I completely agree, that the ruling party of the country should level up the cost of the petrol to minimise the effects of the environmental pollution.",9,8.0
Some people think that public health of a country can be improved if the government make laws regarding nutritious food but others think that it is the matter of personal choice and personal responsibility.,"It is a bitter truth that health is important for every nation, but not acceptable that public health is only the  responsibility of the governments.People have different opinion on this concern.This essay will highlight the views of the people and seriousness for it.
Due to the increasing in the population number, health is a big concern and our government is increasing the budget every year for the healthcare, but our healthy index going down largely.For example, The Executives have organised the camp and doctors have diagnosed properly and provide the medicine accordingly, while patients are not taking it on time as per their guidance then surely it will badly affect the body and become more serious.In such cases, The Administration has done their duty and we can't blame them and it is our fault that we have not accepted it broadly. Is blaming on anyone solving the issue? The answer is absolutely wrong.
Although, government has been assigned two-third part of their budget for this
Department.
On the other hand, People have their opinion that  everyone have their understanding of 
Rudimentary things for physical fitness and the will try to do some  regular exercise as well as yoga and various other activities which will help them to make fit.Moreover, taking the nutritions like ample fruits or vegetables which make their bones strong and improve their potential for work.
In conclusion, This is everyone's responsibility not only for the government, but also for the humans. People should plan their day and reserve at least a few hours for their body maintenance because this will give them more motivation in the future. According to me, local bodies steps are not giving fruitful result if we don't do the awareness for the campaign and alert them with the harmful results.",7,7.0
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Nowadays, a healthy lifestyle is getting progressively popular among all people around the globe. Overall, it is a great course and as far as we know, a lot of modern citizens want to follow this image, because they have got many advertisements and pressure from mass media. Additionally, in terms of involving new individuals, this strategy has to be prolonged, plus it would be very efficient to include special sport and educational programmes into a free package, which will be accessible for all citizens. Moreover, provide an affordable cost of healthy food in order to ensure, that they have an equal price with fast food and other insalubrious products.

Considering the main reasons, we can notice that plenty of individuals just want to be fancy, sporty and keep up with the times. For instance, in Russia, especially in Moscow there is one very famous and modern grocery network which provide high-quality products, it also has a very nice design and many bonus programmes. Consequently, the majority of neighbours prefer to buy everything there and in connection with this have become involved in this image of life. Furthermore, the Internet and especially social networks are full of photos whit sporty and young strangers, which can motivate other people to follow their image.  

Overall, modern society has got many motivating features and mostly they are successfully working. However, it would be helpful to afford them more opportunities and engage new participates. For instance, in several regions of the United Kingdome, there was a special educational programme, whose propose was organizing personal consultations and monitoring the statistics. Finally, it was a very useful idea, because they had got very positive results with improvements in the health condition of many citizens.   

In conclusion, I would like to stress, that since many individuals have found out this style as a fashionable and modern, they want to be a part of this movement. However, in many countries, it is still very expensive and not available to all citizens. Looking towards the future, it is no doubt a given that in alignment with the current course the modern society on a good way and we should continue together and will help other individuals have become a part of it.",8,7.5
"Write about the following topic.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

You should write at least 250 words.","In recent times, it is popularly noticed that social skills are becoming very valuable. In some industries,  recruiters feel that the interpersonal competencies of most job seekers have more value than their academic qualifications. I moderately agree with this opinion. This essay will discuss the reasons for my point of view.

To begin with, it is important to note that communication is an integral part of every work environment. Apart from interacting with clients, an employee needs to demonstrate social competency when relating with their colleagues to foster a healthy work space which in turn breeds organisation success. For instance, in my place of work, I have noticed that there is increased productivity when we work as a team with little to no conflict. However, in cases when there is a disagreement, there is less efficiency in achieving a task. This proves that good communication which results from good social skills promotes productiveness in every business establishment.

On the other hand, the educational accomplishments of an individual seeking a job are equally essential. This is because most professional jobs require a certain amount of skills and knowledge that is acquired through learning. To illustrate, only individuals who have received academic training as a nurse or a medical doctor should be allowed to carry out medical treatments and procedures for ailing individuals. Anything otherwise would result in hazards or loss of life whether the employee has good interpersonal skills or not.

To sum it up, this essay has explained why social skills, as well as academic eligibility, should equally be considered by employers when they decide to hire for a role. I hereby recommend that organisations should arrange training or workshops on good communication among their staff members.",6,6.5
"Some people think that museum should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","A museum is considered a palace of art, science, culture and history. Many argue that a museum is supposed to be entertaining enough to attract visitors, while others think it is a public institution solely for educational purposes. This essay below will discuss both views along with my opinion.

It’s completely understandable that a considerable amount of people are fond of an entertaining museum because it caters to their needs of leisure and curiosity, especially for travelers and families with children, who would see a museum as “an amusement park” with cultural atmosphere. In addition, the more appealing museums a city has, the more visitors it can attract, which is likely to boost local businesses and promote the city’s image.

Turning to the aims of education, museums teach us about the profound history and abstract science in probably the best way human being came out of. With those tangible sets and artefacts on display, people can fully immerse themselves in the informative environment around, not only to learn knowledge, but also to feel them. For instance, many primary schools in Beijing have found that the most efficient way for students to learn Chinese history is to take a trip to the Palace Museum, as known as the Forbidden City.

In my opinion, these two views above are not mutually exclusive. An ideal museum can serve dual purposes, both entertainingly and educationally. Hence, it should be our shared goal to make museums a better reconcilement of acquiring knowledge and having fun.",5,6.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion","The  automotive industry is undergoing one of the most crucial transformations since its inception. A world of silent hybrids and electric cars has been ushered in by the automobile manufacturers as a result of this green environment movement. I believe the inefficiencies of yesterday’s technology must be amended for the betterment of the future, and by this, I do not mean to suggest the end of the IC engines but rather their advancement. Wanting to be a part of this evolution, I entered this intriguing branch of engineering and enrolled in an undergraduate program in Automobile Engineering at PSG College of Technology. 

In my freshman year, I enthusiastically involved with the Society of Automotive Engineers and attended several seminars and workshops. The seminar on Industry 1 familiarised me with the fundamentals of big data, cloud platform, and IoT. I also attended technical workshops on computational methods, autonomous driving, and ADAS technologies which gave me an insight into machine learning techniques, how they can be utilized to predict complex system behaviour, and to detect failure modes that would potentially degrade the vehicle performance at various aspects. This insight has been very valuable and has also kindled a deep interest in further gaining knowledge on the imminent automotive technologies.

In my sophomore year, I took to the practical aspects of the curriculum and worked in the SAE Pegasus team as a powertrain engineer, which is one among the finest and most recognized formula student teams in India. We participated in the national level event called Formula Student India held at Buddh International circuit in 2015. We secured the third place in skid pad and acceleration events, and overall we managed to finish among the top five teams. It taught us the different latitudes of approach in designing and manufacturing methods. It enhanced my knowledge of engine intake and exhaust dynamics as I was responsible for the design, analysis, and manufacturing of engine intake and exhaust systems. My design recommendations in the intake manifold runner and exhaust manifold, similar to the concept of a twin-scroll turbocharger, helped in improving the volumetric efficiency of the engine, thereby improving the vehicle acceleration. Mentoring juniors and working in the Pegasus team evolved me as a very good team player with good resilience. It helped me to understand the importance of project planning and time management. Moreover, I had an opportunity to acquire two weeks of in-plant training at Ashok Leyland, which gave me an understanding of the automotive product life cycle and the basic functioning characteristics of the vehicle sub-systems.

In addition to exploring the depth of engineering, I also expanded my horizons and interests through various extracurricular activities. I was an active volunteer at the National Service Scheme (NSS). While on my first NSS camps in one of the most remote places, I got an opportunity to teach basic mathematics and science to a group of 20 children aged between 12 and 16 years. Since then, I was a part of many more camps, and I thoroughly enjoyed serving the needy people. I discovered the organizational and leadership potential in me when I was an active member of the SAE student chapter under which we have organized numerous seminars and workshops. I was a member of the organizing committee for the renowned go-kart event - Schumi of tech, where I got to lead an energetic bunch of juniors. I volunteered in the FMSCI national level car rally championship, as a technical inspector for the world-class rally cars.

In the final year, I got an internship opportunity in the R&D sector of Jayem Automotives Pvt Ltd where I was given a challenging task to develop a real-time predictive 1-D Thermodynamic model for a 3 cylinder 800cc DICOR engine for the given engine configuration. Under the guidance of AVL, the thermodynamic cycle calculations were carried out using 1-D AVL Boost by implementing Wiebe combustion model factors and port flow coefficients from a similar benchmark engine to analyze the engine performance feasibility. Valve timing optimization and valve lift studies were done, and the pumping losses were reduced by advancing the exhaust valve opening. The exhaust residuals were reduced with an optimum valve overlap. Turbocharger matching and altitude feasibility studies were done to analyze the turbine and compressor efficiency at critical points and to avoid surge and choke conditions. The critical temperature and pressure limits were verified for the complete system at wide-open throttle condition. The low-end torque of the engine was reduced to examine the effect of air-fuel ratios in the lower operating speeds and the model was further calibrated to achieve a good correlation with the engine test bed data, thereby reducing the efforts taken for engine calibration and testing during various milestones. It had given me an exceptional exposure in engine thermodynamic modelling, simulation, calibration and testing methods.

Having proven my technical abilities and novel problem-solving skills during my internship, I was hired in the powertrain CAE department. I had acquired a comprehensive knowledge of leading-edge engineering principles, tools, and practices, with emphasis on designing, building, and validation of powertrain subsystems, by working with eminent organizations like AVL, BOSCH, TATA Motors, DRDO, Altair, Siemens, and Magna Steyr. My professional career commenced in one of the most challenging projects where an IC engine was developed for an aerospace application. I was introduced to the concepts of white, black and grey box modelling to evaluate the engine performance feasibility up to an altitude of 30,000 feet. Turbocharger selection and altitude derating studies were done for various aero grade fuels to evaluate the engine breathing capacity at high altitudes. The engine brake power required to produce essential thrust from the propeller at high altitudes was achieved with stringent limits on the BSFC. The fidelity of the model was further validated for higher altitudes with the test data from altitude chamber testing. 

One of my works on the engine thermal management was presented at a national conference, ATCx 2018 event conducted by Altair engineering. A research on the cooling jacket optimization was done to evaluate the effect of peak temperatures in the low cycle fatigue regions of the engine head and block for the material AlSi7MgT6. Moreover, execution of In-cylinder flow and combustion analysis under the guidance of AVL in the development of 3 cylinder DICOR engine had given me a profound knowledge of the computational methods in thermal and fluid science. My involvement in the ICE projects has made me cognizant of the product life cycle of an engine from concept to homologation. Apart from the ICE, I researched the subject of battery thermal runaway for the high voltage (320 V) Li-ion battery pack deployed in TATA Nexon EV. To establish a robust cooling system, calorimeter tests, joule heating, and battery pack CFD studies were done to analyze the heat dissipation characteristics and predict the cell peak temperatures for various drive cycles. The battery performance and ohmic and polarization curves were determined using HIL battery testing. Furthermore, I developed valve control strategies using MATLAB/Simulink to maintain optimum cell temperature during charging and discharging at all ambient conditions and SOC and for various drive cycles.

To improve my technical competence and gain expertise in world-class automotive technologies, I stepped into the next phase of my career by securing a prominent role at one of the leading alliance automotive companies in the world, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Emerging as a powertrain system simulation engineer in a team that comprises of technical scholars working on cutting edge projects, proves the level of my technical abilities and also substantiates the fact that my academic grades do not reflect on my true potential. My responsibilities include hydraulic and thermo hydraulic system simulation of vehicle cooling system for ICE, BEV, HEV, and PHEV platform vehicles under EURO 6D and EURO7 norms globally. I have accomplished a challenging task of developing e-pump and valve control strategies in the cooling circuit for cold and hot phase operations for the Indian version of the BS6 HR10DET engine and CMF EV vehicle. I am currently engaged in the design of cooling system architecture for the next generation CMF EV followed by energy conservation studies like heat recovery methods for battery warm-up and the Rankine cycle reheating method for generating electric power in HEV and PHEV. In addition to the expertise gained over the years, cross-functional interaction with the global technical teams of Renault and Nissan have made a huge impact on my technical and interpersonal skills. 

Having acquired profound knowledge in the field of powertrain, I want to further explore the depths of the field and the Master of Science in Automotive Engineering at Clemson University, with its stimulating research environment will equip me for such a feat. After graduating, I wish to pursue a research-oriented career in one of the leading automotive companies, devising solutions to overcome the challenges in the evolution of IC engines with stringent regulations. Dr. Zoran Filipi’s tremendous contribution in the field of advanced IC engine concepts aligns with my interest of pursuing interdisciplinary research in the field of IC engine advanced combustion methods and control strategies followed by energy conservation methods to improve IC engine technologies for a clean and sustainable future. Hence, I aim to utilize my skill set to contribute significantly in the powertrain domain and become an expert by gaining a stellar career in the field of sustainable powertrain technology.",2,4.5
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession, what factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it.","How many university students are forced to choose a profession which is not aligned with the following graduation programme each year? Even though someone could argue that anyway they are not unemployed and have a way to move forward with life, will they be honestly satisfied? This is a huge issue that most current graduates face every year. 

One of the main causes for this situation is the outdated courses which are not adjusted according to the current market trends. Because of that, the graduates will find a massive gap between the university and industry which will affect their capability to perform well. It is common to see that currently ,many companies conduct onboarding sessions and training sessions for fresh graduates who just joined the company. So, companies have expanded the chosen degree programs for a particular role as anyway they have to train graduates for it from the beginning.

Another reason would be allowing students to get enrolled with the courses without thinking about the actual requirement of the industry. This leads to an overwhelming number of graduates will be available for few opportunities, which will force some of them to find a profession even if it does not directly go along with the speciality. Many physical science studying students finally have to choose different professions due to this reason.

Conducting a realistic research on current market trends in the industry is required to rectify this issue. Graduation programmes need to be adjusted and intake needs to be limited so that graduates will find more aligned professions with the courses and expectations.",2,4.5
Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people ‘s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both view and give you own opinion.,"Nowadays, people’s lifestyle is influenced by a number of factors. While a host of people believe that climate is the most important factor,affecting our daily life, others claim that the local economy is actually the determining factor. I strongly opine that economy is the real agent.

On the one hand, climate can affect  both individuals’ meals and their occupations. First of all, during all eras, mankind had to adapt their selves to  climate changes to survive. To explain, Although staple crops are mostly consumed by people in tropical regions, Eskimos have brought up neither rice nor wheat;because of the tundra climate, a frozen soil without any possibility of growing a plant, the Inuits have to eat marine animals, secondly it can be seen that people who live nearby the seas, would choose fishing as a career; or if they live nearby woodlands, like the southern jungles of Iran, they may pursue carpentry to make money. Hence, food and work, affecting our daily life, are impressed by the weather.

On the other hand, people's living conditions can be specified by the economy. To explain, the governments of the regions of the world which has poor weather condition can overtake their challenges and gift a happy life with lots of facilities to their citizens. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, is a salient example of this matter. This city is located in one of the hottest barren deserts in the Middle East, but through the global trade in fossil fuels, gained a huge wealth, causing the welfare of citizens. Today, Dubai’s population are living in luxurious mansions; even though the weather is extremely hot, the municipality put some large air conditions on pavements. Therefore,  economic situations significantly make an impression on humans’ lives.

To conclude, while the climate can interfere with what people eat or do, I contend that fortune can surely overcome  the effect of weather as a city like Dubai has amenities like perfect houses as well as public coolers, reducing the effect of climate.",10,8.5
"In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this? What can be done to improve the situation?","It's believed that it's getting more difficult to land a fixed job nowadays, especially for the youth, and that with the passage of time it keeps inching closer and closer to the impossible. However, I think that this situation is getting blown out of proportion.

First, more than one factor has to be taken as a cause of this dilemma, starting with the employment rate, the number of jobs available, the general condition of the economy and the retirement age. These factors differ by country and should be taken in account as a cause for the decrease in the vacancy of work spots availability to all without regards to the factor of age.

Secondly, people think that most of the employers and bosses will only hire the middle-aged applicants, as they are more likely to have worked and achieved more in their work-life than their younger counterparts. This in turn leads to the younger generation being more prone to scrutinization due to their working experience. This can be fixed by the willingness of the job seekers to work more, no one can expect life to be easy, and if you want to live a good life you are likely to work tears and blood for it.

To conclude with, I think that the new wave of job hunters has a good number of exceptionally capable people, with a great magnitude of qualifications and work under their names. And that the problem of getting a job is more in the mind of the searcher than the country they live in.",3,5.0
some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time .This can benefit teenageers and the community as well .to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that the younger generation should volunteer for free in their spare time, which would be beneficial for them and society as a whole. Personally, I completely agree with this view as described in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, people who participate in community activities have more opportunities to meet a lot of people from different regions and backgrounds. They can see all aspects of life through which they will learn how to communicate with different people, have compassion for each other, and how to work in a group. Besides that, participating in volunteer activities is the perfect time for children to develop skills such as time management, communication, and problem solving, which are strong points for them to compete with other candidates when looking for future work.

On the other hand, it also brings a lot of benefits to the community. Firstly, the local government does not need to spend the budget to hire people to do community work. They may spend those funds on health or education investments. Secondly, young people's participation in volunteering helps reduce the number of crimes and robberies in the country. For example, taking part in community activities helps them raise awareness and stay away from illegal activities and the community will get quality citizens.

In conclusion, I think parents should encourage their teens to take part in the activities of serving the community in their free time. because it has a great advantage both for society and for adolescents.",7,7.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit the community and the teenagers as well. To what extend do you agree or disagree,"Some people are of the beliefs that adolescent in their free time should be made to carry out unrewarded community service. This can impact positively  on both the community and the teenagers. Although it is nice that young adult engage in voluntary activities in the areas they live in, I feel , they should be give a token for their services, reasons being that, getting paid will give them a sense of pride,and level of achievement,  as well as aid development and increases happiness.

Firstly, being paid ,gives youth a sense of pride and achievement, as they feel within themselves that they gave their best to carry out an activity ,a diligently complete task helps them place value on themselves, as they get to see who they really are and what they can do.Also it creates room for development as they invest more time into areas they are efficient in , inorder to reach their full potential. More so, payment helps in developing useful qualities like team work and aid interaction with others. For example , if not paid ,an adolescent will want to hurriedly work ,so he can go back to doing other things, and may view interaction as fruitless, vice versa when payment is involved. 

Secondly, no matter how little a reward for work is, it instills discipline and brings forth happiness.  An adolescent, fully aware that he or she is to receive a pay after a job well done is more like to carry out such task efficiently,  to be time conscious on days when they have a job, and will do so with happiness .for example a youth whose duty is to the mowing lanes, will do so excitedly,  knowing compensation for hard work awaits him or her.

Inconclusion, while actively and voluntarily participating in community services by teenagers is beneficial .I am of the opinion that the benefit of paying for services rendered outweighs the demerit.",5,6.0
"New technology has resulted in many jobs, which used to be performed by people, now being done by computers or robots. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","These days, due to technology and science development, the role of computers in our lives is more prominent than ever. Day by day, we see more humans vocational positions that are replaced by robots and computers. However, I believe, while this trend has brought us many benefits, due to inaccuracy and instability of computers, they can cause many negative consequences in our lives.

First and foremost, even with the enormous advancement in computer sciences, the result can lead to poor performance and critical issues. These modern tools still are not able to perform some delicate jobs as accurate as of the humankind. In recent decades, scientists have done their best to utilize robots in jobs such as performing microsurgeries, but are not always successful. Not only robots failed in many cases, but they also caused unfixable outcomes for the users. For example, one of the most famous computer failure cases occurred in Shiraz Hospital in 2002, which ended up into casualty of a patient. This patient was prepared to undergo a simple appendicitis surgery with the aid of a highly advanced robot. However, because the virtual surgeon performed a wrong action, it cut one of the patient's main arteries and caused death. Examples like this prove that the adverse consequences of using computers for sensible jobs could be disastrous. 

Furthermore, computers are vulnerable to many threats which can disrupt their function. In other words, the more smart they become, the more faulty they can function. As IT scientists discover novel methods of utilizing computers in people's work, malware programmers also publish viruses and spyware which have the potentials to completely shut down the entire global computer systems. A salient example here is the ""CryptoWall"" ransomware made by an unknown team in 2014. The trojan they made, targeted financial institutes by hacking their clients' accounts, and encrypting their information into nonsense codes unreadable by these institutes. This malware caused a significant problem for both clients and corporations and have not been solved unless the large banks were forced to pay a considerable amount of cash, as a ransom to the hackers. 

In conclusion, using computers in our daily lives seems inevitable. However, there are occasions that these machines cause major issues, instead of helping us. Therefore, these failures make them not to be reliable tools in every job.",8,7.5
Government spend a lot of money on education. More money should be spent on free time activities. To what extent do agree or disagree?,"The government assigns considerable money to education. This is important for people because they may ignore the recreational activities, which as vital. I partially agree value of leisure activities for students.

Undoubtedly, spending money on education is very essential for the nation. If people are educated, can nurture another generation very well. Also, they could have higher-paid jobs in their field of expertise, which can help to economic society. For instance, if the government pay attention to the deprived and educates them, they will be successful in the future and they can change the situation of their family. So education would be most meaningful for any nation.

On the other hand, free-time activity is just as important as education. The government should not ignore it, as it can improve learning, especially for children and teenagers. The government can regulate leisure activities which is beneficial to find people's interests and talents. For example, any city must have a place for children to learn about different jobs in the form of games and entertainment. knowing their interests makes the learning platform more targeted.

To sum up, while I agree the cost of tutoring is useful for society, I believe that education along with recreational activities can be more effective, so it will be worth spending.",3,5.0
It is common for people to travel long distances for work and study. Some argue that longer commute times affect people in a negative way while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In last recent decades, based on laxity in job opportunities, living in metropolitan cities, and so on, people have to spend a lot of time and energy on the way. So, there are two different kinds of view as follow; the one is that shipment times can have detrimental effects on human beings, and the second is that longer commute times do not have drawbacks. Although there are so many benefits in working and travelling long distances to your workplace or studying institutes, I side with the first opinion.

Firstly, transportation imposes a great deal of money on the national budget, and every day millions of people use public transport so governments have to disburse money and it is not financially justifiable.  However, by accumulating  money, authorities can provide job opportunities or progress to elite universities. Having provided career opportunities, governments can disburse  eco-friendly vehicles, and subsequently, they prevent air pollution which appears by transportation.

Secondly, physical pain paves the way for mental disorders so, by travelling far distances, people are about to be frustrated. Consequently, frustration can make a lot of family conflicts, and it can affect their life  a group of problems will be appeared in the family such as family breakdowns and children's upbringing issues.

Finally, it is said to immigration to the cities has increased in last recent decades, and it is due to better accommodations and facilities which are currently provided in megacities so it has a detrimental effect on our rural life. For example, our industries which rely on rural districts will be damaged and a great part of our domestic product will be decreased. Accordingly, GDP will decrease, and it hinder sustainable country progressions.

In conclusion, although there are so many benefits to working and studying in prestigious associations, it has lots of drawbacks to consider such as wasting the national budget, mental disorders, and destroying rural lives and industries.",8,7.5
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Everyone knows that art has been being taught for years at schools. Many people say that art is an important subject for pupils at school, however, others say that it is just time-consuming. The aim of this essay is made to compare these views and at the end, I will give my own opinion.
           Firstly, the reason why some people definitely argue that the advantages of art subjects outweigh its disadvantages is they think that art is showing imagination of a pupil on paper. So, they believe that children illustrate their emotions directly by art. For example, on parties or birthdays, children can show their love and emotions by creating creative cards for their loved people. I think, for this reason, these people mentioned art as beneficial. 
           However, some other people think that art is completely unnecessary. The reason for this is very huge numbers of children that give interests for other Academic subjects, so they don’t have time for art apart from these subjects. Additionally, nowadays there are no really good job opportunities for artists or for the lovers of art. For example, If I study subjects like science or math, I can apply many different jobs, such as business, marketing, IT manager and others. But, if I learn art, I can be just an artist. So, in this way people’s mind is correct.
          In conclusion, both arguments have their qualities. If children learn art, it will help them in showing their imaginations. However, their job vacancies may decrease because of wasting time on art. So, I am a neutral thinker.",7,7.0
Some people say that most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Current years, we have realized that so many urgent problems can be solved by multi- national cooperation. Although it can’t be denied that it holds true to some issues, I think this is not the perfect resolution for all urgent troubles.
It’s obvious that cross-border cooperation has recently contributed to improve and reduce some global issues. For example, global warming calls for deeply concern from all nations and requests them to participate to reduce both tree cutting, gas emissions and plastic consumption.
However, governments of every country should be responsible for their own internal issues. Every country understands clearly about what are their urgent problems and how priority level they set aside as their country’s goal. Besides, each nation has own culture and administration system, common global processes sometimes are unable to apply. Each government will revise their multinational agreements in applying progress, subjected to their nation’s conditions. For example same- sex- marriage is opened and legalized in many countries, but it is still banned in others.
In resume, international cooperation is truly important and paves the way for globalization, but each country should not rely mostly on foreign-aid but positively tackle their internal issues as their expectation.",3,5.0
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.




Discuss both views and give your opinion","In this concurrent world, it is undoubtedly true that children should learn art subject in their school. While, some people believe that learning art subject is a waste of time and money. This essay is in support of former opinion and shall discuss both sides of arguments with reliable illustration before presenting a logical conclusion.
Lately, education gives people knowledge and skills. All subjects are highly important for students and they always try to learn all subjects. These days, art is an essential subject at school because, some students are not interested in studying and they can’t get good marks appropriately, those children learn art in their school time. Learning art is necessary for students because of some reasons. Firstly, art subject including drawing, music,  animation, graphics, artistic design, and computer. When children fill bored that time, they should listen some music and make some paintings on natural beauty. Art is much needed for their Physical growth and the can learn practical life skills such as: teamwork, planning and generate new ideas. Such creative and artistic activities are good and beneficial for students.
Moreover, learning art is not a waste of money but it’s a needed for students because some students don’t have some skills such as: patients, creativity and many more. If, they learn art than they easily express their love and emotions for their parents by creating a birthday card and some homemade gifts using their creativity. They get relaxation from such creative and artistic activities. Sometimes, some children are interested in make natural beauty paintings so, they should always focus on their paintings and also they make their bright future. 
However, art is an unnecessary for students because some parents don’t have more money therefore, their children are studying in big school and their parents pay higher fees than school also teach art such as : music and drawing classes, that's a bad thing and also some parents do hard work and pay higher fees in their child’s school but their children might be wasting their parents money and time. Some children are not interested in art therefore, their class teachers forced to attend art classes. So, children waste their important time in art and they can’t get good result.
To conclude, art is important for the child’s growth and they easily learn new important skills and they also make a bright future. So, schools should provide art classes and students always attend art classes and learn new life skills.",2,4.5
Some people belie that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinions?,"These days, human are being progressively replaced by artificial intelligent robots in the workshop. Thought it is possible that all the physicals, unskilled works will require a machine, it is impossible to perform work those deals with precise skilled and human feelings. This essay will demonstrate only minor work will be performed by human being.

Eventually, all the works that does not need any specific knowledge but only require labour will be mechanized by the android. 
Many factories and companies believed that if those menial jobs are dined by the automatic machine, it could save both time and money rather than spending upon hiring, training and employing human. In restaurants in Nepal, for instance, many waiters and cashiers have being replaced by artificial machines that consume less money. Furthermore, those artificial robots can work all day and night without any rest and salary, so that human labour will be changed with robotic intelligence, if only it doesn't need any sort of skilled to perform work.

On the contrary, there are certain jobs that can not be replaced by robots because manmade robots can never reach to real human's brain.In simple way, to do such as doctor, medicines and social work, ones must have both skilled and emotions, which is absence in artificial robots. Unless, those works are not done by skilled human, it cannot be satisfied. Hence, robots will never be able to achieve those skills of human which has existed in human's brain.

Highly sophisticated, complex works will always need human skills, however unskilled will eventually complete by robots. For these reason only few work will be available for human in today's world.it is most likely that machine will continue its employment by replacing human in most works",1,4.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we  need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or  disagree?","In recent decades, global warming has been receiving a great deal of  media attention around the world due to its substantial impacts on human  life. Although the idea of coexistence between climate change and  humans appears reasonable, this cannot be viewed as the ultimate  approach for humankind to combat climate change.  There are a number of reasons why the coexistence can do more harm  than good. First, climate change is largely shaped by human-caused  geoengineering rather than nature itself. For example, in order to produce  the energy that drives the world’s economy, most nations rely on carbonrich fuels like coal, oil and gas, which directly correlates with the  intensification of global warming. Second, even if citizens agree to keep  the environment the way it is, corporations, especially in the  manufacturing and mining industries, would not as that would affect their  profits. Therefore, it can be implied that if corporations were not held  accountable for their contribution to global warming as in the case of  coexistence, the issue of climate change would inevitably be  exacerbated.  It is more economically sound to actively prevent climate change than to  ignore it. In fact, the costs, either financial or non-financial, of dealing  with future consequences of climate change can be overwhelming. For  instance, the increase in intensity and frequency of storms can cause  massive destructions and deaths in many coastal areas, which would  take decades to recover. In addition, rising temperatures have also  contributed to the extinction of species worldwide. It should be noted  that the extinction is irreversible and comes at great cost to the  ecosystem and apparently humans living within it.  In conclusion, actively combating global warming must be regarded as top priority given the high urgency. Governments and corporations  worldwide should take steps to ensure that climate change remains at  bay.",2,4.5
"Education for young people is important in many countries. However, the others think government should spend more money for education in adult population who cannot read and write”.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In the majority of states education is fundamental for young people. Despite this, the others believe that public institutions should destinate more budget to allow old population to learn how wrtite and read. Altough I agree that educational services should be offered mainly to the teenage community, I think to permit a complete development of a country is important to share these programs among adults.

On the one hansd, the youth represent the principal source for the growth of a nation. The school system must give the possibility to improve their skills and let them to reach their dreams. For this reason, governaments have to allocate big amount of money on this field because only in this way will be possible to create a future workforce that may increase the richness of a country. To instance, in Italy there are many money prize for poor students to let them to continue their studies after high school and to attend the most prestigious univerisities following their job ambitious.

On the other hand, to  have the fully evolution of a nations most of the citizens must know reading and writing. This because is not aceptable that many adults, especially in the poorest areas of a country dont know this skills. This situation affects the general wellbeing of a nation because especially in third world nations many productivity sectors can evolve and improve their productions because of the missing of educated employees. For example, in 1970 is started a enormous educational programme in Italy that consisted in the creation of schools in far villages of the nations with the pourpose of reducing consistently the number of illiterates providing them all the items that need to improve their abilities and have a better future.

To conclude, though I agree that large amount of money must be spend for the development of knowledge between scholars, I think that another part should be destinate to dramatically reduce numbers of adults that still are not able to write and to read because this issue reprent a big obstacle to the growth of a nation.",3,5.0
"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.

What are the reasons for this?

What can be done to solve this problem?","It has been argued by many individuals that in this contemporary era, it is more complicated to emphasise their education. This essay shall not only elucidate the causes of this statement but also scrutinize how it can be curbed in subsequent paragraphs along with a reasoned conclusion.

To begin with, the fundamental ground of this nation is that people want to spend time on technological gadgets. In this day and age, digitalization is proliferating regularly so, the majority of human beings waste their time on mobile phones as compared to do studying as they tend to enjoy all the time. Thus, they do not concentrate properly on the academic field. For instance, a survey conducted by Harward University revealed that in (2021) 65% of students all over the world lack of knowledge regarding their studies and they faced major problems related to getting a job as they do not have a degree in any domain. Hence, it puts an adverse impact on society and people.

To curb this, the mitigating factor is that parents need to make a timetable for their young ones. If offsprings have schedule of daily routine when they do study and playing games, they might more focus on education because they would know once they do complete their tasks at school then they may give time to indoor activities or outdoor. For example, it is published article by The Tribune newspaper showed that approximately 70% of learners are getting good scores in their classes because family members give them time to play games with the study.

To conclude, although the main reason people do not pay attention to their education as they expend their most of life on smartphones, it can be measured if senior people in their families could give time to all work as it is a better solution.",5,6.0
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environment problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","A group of people believe that increasing the price of fuel is the ideal method to combat the environmental issues across the globe. I, on the other hand, do not agree with this argument since it appears to me that the best way of dealing with this problem is to increase awarenes of this issue.

 Altought I cannot deny that rising a fuel price would alleviate this issue in a short term, the problem will remain the same in a long period. The main reason is that in human psychology the more you incease the demadn the more people work hard to achieve it. Thus, from this standpoint it could be said that if a fuel price is risen to handle the global environmental problems, people will try not to lose their demand, which is a fuel in this case or in other words convenience. In this way, they will not even be aware of the solving global environmental issue. In stead, folks will consider this change as a punishment. 

Nevertheless, I firmly believe that solving this problem is related to people themselves or their minds. If starting from school years everyone is educated about the importance of natural resources and protecting them, it would have a long-lasting effects. Apart from this, if social networking websites are forced to prepare programs about the significance of nature and solving existing problems in this manner, it is more likely to have positive effects. The main reason for this is that it is the social media that controls poeples mind. Therefore, if we focus on informing and educating individuals about the issue, it is highly probable that environmental problems will be handled on a global scale. 

In conclusion, I consider that while it is true that a high fuel price can somehow have positive effects about eradicating global problems that are related to environment, it will not be continuously. The best method to combat the issue is to develop individuals understanding.",3,5.0
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do You agree or disagree with it?,"Dear aunt Mary, 

How are you? I am overjoyed to receive your letter and to learn that you are planning to be a space tourist. It is such an exciting idea but I feel that you need to consider more about the advantages and disadvantages before you go. 

As you and I are probably aware , the space-travelling industry is a whole new industry and a new industry means more jobs for people. In this way, by participating in space travels, you are helping to create a new job market that can help more people here on earth. 

Another thing about space travel is that it allows you to get a new perspective on Earth: the perspective from above that you have never experienced before. Maybe this change of view might help other people to come up with new ideas about what we can do for our earth relating to climate change. Since this is a serious problem all people will be equally affected, including you and me. 

But unfortunately, space-travelling also has its disadvantages. The first thing is that space tourism probably does more harm than good to the environment. Since the rockets will release a huge amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, therefore increasing the rate of climate change and global warming. 

Furthermore, I am also a little skeptical about the safety of space tourism. As you know, the technology of space travelling is still new and unlike travelling with planes or trains, nobody knows what might happen. In the end, nobody can promise or guarantee anything for your safety. So I think you might want to think about the trip more. 

In my opinion, although I can understand the interesting idea of travelling in space, I still think it is too early for you to go on a space trip. But like I have said before, the technology is still new and safety is hard to guarantee when you are out there in the infinity of space. 

I hope my letter was not too long and please greet your family for me. 

Best regards",4,5.5
Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of one international organization rather than each national government. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, all people in the world are aimed to increase their income and earn a better life. Therefore, one of the most common topics for discussion is money and how much of it every person has. This idea and its influence on society and human beings will be observed in this essay.

First things first, it is essential to determine the reasons for this tendency. Obviously, it is the most simple way to determine the status of a person. If someone earns much less than other, most likely they will not have a lot in common to discuss. Besides, money is one of the things that we face on the everyday basis, and therefore, it is common to discuss it. Moreover, those who have a highest income might improve their self-esteem vie this discussion. Some might force others to share the information about their salary even if it is under NDA.

This behavior has both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, this motivates people to work more to get more and this benefits them as well as economy overall. On the other hand, It might cause a problem of the glass ceiling when people are forced to stay on their current workplace without any possibility of promotion. It might cause burnouts and depression and the job might become impossibly hard. Furthermore, research from The Guardian discovered that in some more severe cases such long term attempts that have no result might force people to do grim things.

In the end, it might be said that all topics should be available for discussion but no one should be forced to talk about things that they do not like. In my opinion, there are various things exept money that well-worth to be discussed.",1,4.0
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teenagers can learn a lot through working in the community in their free time. Many people believe that this can be advantageous to the community and the children because services like picking up garbage and helping elders can teach teenagers to keep the place clean and tidy and respect their elders. I believe, however, that they should be paid for their work and time rather than doing it for free. 

Children do have free time compared to adults. It can motivate them to participate in these activities, utilized time appropriately, and get paid.  In other words, knowing that they will earn through their hard work without even pushing them, they will participate voluntarily. For instance, if a teenager wants to buy pair of sports shoes, he will work in the community and earn that money rather than asking his parents. However, if asked to work for free, they might end up not performing the tasks well. They will find reasons to avoid performing services to the community. When forced to do the job, the outcome might turn out to be poor. For example, when rewarded, the child will be willing to do duty with utmost care. Therefore, it should be compulsory to pay, when they are working in their leisure time.

In conclusion, the community should pay children for working because it will motivate them. In addition, there would not be any need to force them because they will voluntarily participate considering the reward they will earn.",4,5.5
"Education for young people is important in many countries. However, some people think that governments should spend more money on education in adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Today, most youngsters are obviously supposed to go to school to receive academic knowledge. Nevertheless, mature people who are illiterate are also considered to be worth getting that opportunity. My own view on this matter is that I approve of the latter opinion while I believe in the merits of the former one too.
It is indeed reasonable that providing money to develop education for illiterate adults will help them so much. First, were governments not to do so, it seems to me that the unemployment rate in a country would be on increase because most jobs nowadays doubtlessly require workers to have the two most basic skills which are reading and writing. Therefore, people would be jobless and could not make money to maintain their lives because of their illiteracy. Second, they would also find it difficult to enjoy themselves in basis life. Humans need to watch news, read newspapers and text others everyday which demand their literacy. Hence, they could not even inform what is happening around the world or update daily events which contributed to the boredom in life. Finally, adults who have children were not able to help them as they sometimes need their parents to instruct them with homework and read fairy tales before sleeping.
However crucial education for grown individuals is, I do emphasize the importance of that for teenagers. Without any doubt, they are the ones who will decide how well-developed their nation is and also affect the world. Thus, I claim that focusing on educational systems for children is so beneficial for people to do. For example, once people spend money organizing campaigns, upgrading studying methods and equipment and constructing lessons for students, they will probably perfectly develop and become talented people who enrich their countries.
Overall, I insist that school students and adults who suffer from illiteracy are worthwhile to get the educational support invested money by governments.",5,6.0
"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. why is this the case? which development do you think this better?","In this contemporary era, people's preference over transportation is changing day by day. As a result, in some cities, they prefer bicycles to cars. While in other places, this trend is just the opposite. In my opinion, the former way is better than the latter. This essay shall discuss the reasons for this changing trend. 

On the one hand, the world as a global village is aware of the rising pollution level and the majority are concerned about its impact on the environment. This concern plays a major role when it comes to choosing bicycles instead of cars. For example, recent studies conducted in the USA has shown an increase in bicycle usage by 10% compared to last year. However, this change in attitude is mainly seen in developed countries as the majority of the population is literate and can easily acknowledge the future consequences of pollution. 

In addition to the above, nowadays everyone is concerned about their well-being and riding a bicycle is a proven way to improve and maintain physical fitness. Moreover, it gives them a choice to choose between health and comfort . For instance, those who choose fitness over convenience is proven to have  better health of the heart and even the Canadian president commute to his office using a bicycle. Even though only a few  are properly  following the trend. 

On the other hand, people choose their comfort over health and the environment by prioritising car as a mode of transport. Consequently, the traffic blocks increase along with air and noise pollution. For example, the level of carbon monoxide in Delhi is higher than in any other place in India as a result of plummed usage of private vehicles. Although it provides greater convenience , the damage it does to the environment is immeasurable. 

To conclude, I reiterate that, it's better to choose a pollution-free mode of transport like bicycles to provide a better tomorrow for the future generation. This can only be achieved through raising constant awareness among the public.",10,8.5
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The popularity of volunteer work in community has been increased in recent years. Is it true that by doing an unpaid work, both teenagers and community will get a number of benefits? Many people claim that adolescents should use their leisure time to help their surrounding neighbourhoods. I completely agree that by offering a helping hand in the communities nearby, a multitude of positive impacts will be obtained as the following reasons.

To begin with, youth have an opportunity to improve their personal development while volunteering in the local communities. In other words, this kind of social activities might stimulate their empathy and responsibility to others. For instance, when a group of secondary school students joining volunteer program in retirement house during their summer break, they will be encouraged to have a deeper understanding in assisting the elderly. In the same time, they can also imagine if they are getting older, they need several aids from other people. As a result, their level of empathy and responsibility may grow considerably. 

Another benefit to be gained is a volunteer work will support local neighbourhood environment program. For example, local youth community in various island tourism destinations in Indonesia are considered to hold “Beach Clean Project” in every Earth Day celebration. This initiative is conducted to aid locals in protecting the tourist spots environment. By receiving some helps from the youth, local communities can be benefits in conserving their destinations and keep their beach clean.

In conclusion, a myriad of positive impacts is generated by such a volunteer project done by teens. Therefore, I agree that by providing unpaid assistances in the communities, both teenagers and local people will be got the benefits.",6,6.5
Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think it has a negative impact on sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many corporations are sponsoring sporting events or teams as an efficient marketing tool. Some believe this trend exerts negative impacts on sports. I somewhat agree with this.

In the first place, sponsorship leads to a win-win situation for both the event and the corporation. Primarily, companies can provide financial support to competitors that desperately need money. The costs of holding and publicizing a sports event can be exorbitant, and a high-profile international game, such as World Cup, expects billions of dollars. Therefore, the financial aid subsidized by sponsors is essential to cover the venues, equipment, catering and other costly expenditures. In addition, it is a lucrative business for companies, because sponsoring popular teams and competitions can gain immense visibility, develop positive brand associations, and cultivate customer loyalty of certain die-hard sports fans.

In the second place, there are valid reasons to say endorsements damage the events and athletes with their business nature in certain ways. Firstly, the sponsor can manipulate or even exploit the athletes, teams and events to suit their interests. For example, when Nike invested $160 million in a five-year sponsorship of the Brazil national football team, the company was allowed to specify where, when and against whom the national team would play. Secondly, some corporations associate sports with negative images. The cases in point are the alcohol and tobacco companies whose media coverage promotes highly addictive products that deteriorate public health. 

In conclusion, sponsorship has mutual benefits for both parties but over-commercialization will also bring about unwanted manipulation for sports properties and reputation risks if associated with controversial products. On balance, I propose that sports properties should always select their sponsors with caution and never compromise their inherent virtue for revenue.",10,8.5
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well . To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Opinions diverge on whether teenagers should spend their leisure time doing required unpaid community work as this can be beneficial for both individuals and society. While it is true that the young should be required to do unpaid work, it is my belief that unpaid community work should only be encouraged among teenagers.

There are several reasons why community work should be obligated to young people. For one, doing community work can help students acquire experience and skills such as communication skills. This can be explained by the fact that while doing the work, they have to communicate with other fellows, which is likely to boost their confidence to express themselves. Another reason is that teenagers’ volunteer work can have a great impact on a whole society developed by youngsters, since they are provided with experience and knowledge, which would create a decent community to live in. For example, the rate of criminal significantly decreased in Sri Lanka due to the introduction of volunteer work in schools. 

Despite the above arguments, I firmly believe that unpaid community work should not be mandatory to teenagers. It must first be recognized that students are under enough pressure with their studies. In fact, the average time the young have to spend at school is 8-10 hours a day,n which means that school is just as demanding as a full-time job. In addition to this, I would argue that it is against the value of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their wills. Doing this can only raise hatred attitudes amongst young people, which might create a rebellious generation with many social-related problems affecting human’s lives. 

In conclusion,while requiring unpaid community jobs brings certain benefits to individuals and society, I would argue that community work should only be voluntary. It is thus recommended that schools should organize volunteer activities for students who want to engage in helping others.",7,7.0
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business.  Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is believed that climate change can cause negative effect on business in some ways while others think that there are some benefits for business. This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.
	On the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.
	On the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.
	In conclusion, although climate change can impact some drawbacks to the business, there are brighter sides that people can rely on to benefit their business.",4,5.5
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Many students these days find it increasingly difficult to pay attention during lessons. In my opinion, this is partly a natural reaction that has been exacerbater by technology and the solutions lie in school reform.

Students struggle to stay engaged both due to a natural predisposition and the pervasive impact of screen time. Students throughout history have always wanted to escape their school lessons. This is because learning is difficult and provides little pleasure itself relative to both passive and active pastimes like hanging out with friends, watching TV, listening to music, or playing sports. Moreover, the advent of the ubiquitous internet era and portable devices such as smartphones has had an exponential effect on attention spans and diversionary priorities. Most students today are addicted to short videos and posts on social media networks and therefore struggle to follow the intricate arguments of lengthy lectures and extended readings.

On a small scale, individuals can remedy these problems through sheer willpower but for broader change schools must play an active role. The most immediate fix would be to ban phones. This is difficult since phones serve practical purposes such as allowing students to call their parents or book a ride home, but they could be taken at the beginning of the day and returned when school finishes. Another step schools could take would be to modernise the curriculum and account for reduced attention spans. Lessons could be shorter and could include more interactivity in order to stimulate learning. rather than the passive learning environment that has led to daydreaming students for generations.

In conclusion, although this trend is likely an irreversible part of human nature and progress, schools can implement changes. to curb its effects. It is important for parents and governments to be supportive of such reforms as well.",7,7.0
"some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a wast of time.
discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In some people's opinion, art should be noticed at school curriculum, while others think art is time wasting subject at school. To my way of thinking, art is a significant subject to thriving children's talents. Both views of this point will be discussed. 
Many support the view that children, specially in young age of their life, should learn about art. They believe that art is a way for children to epress themselves. I strongly opine that, art is an essential part of school syllables. Art can help to improve children' cognitive skills, also through it children can think outside the box. The role of art at countries cultures is undeniable, pupils would learn about history and cultures because of art. Small children feel good with creativity and art is a main subject to create new things. For instance, one research has shown the children, that join a drawing class during the school time is happier and keen on learn more in school.
Other people think that students should not waist their time with art. Personally speaking, this is not true because children need some time for recreational activities. Given that the main subjects such as math and physics might make school grueling for children and they get bored without any time for interesting subjects such as art.
In conclusion, as oppose to some people's opinion about wasting time, art as a part of school's curriculum should be noticed. It is essential for children to have a chance to express themselves an enjoy their creations through art.",3,5.0
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Education is the foundation upon which one build their future. In this 21st century, home-education is being preferred by numerous parents rather than the primitive way of learning within school premises. In my opinion, there are some benefits; however, these pale in comparison with the potential drawbacks. Various reasons behind this notion are explained explicitly in the following paragraphs.

To commence with, one of the major demerits of not visiting the school is, children will not receive legitimate degree certificates. In this contemporary era, education qualification along with valid proof of one’s capability is the most crucial thing to achieve. If a child does not have formal education, they will not be able to sit for any competitive examinations and job interviews, which require proficiency. Without authorized and verified documents not only getting the job is difficult but also salary will reduce drastically. To illustrate, a survey conducted by the University of California reveals that a carpenter’s wage per hour is 35 dollars on  average, who have completed a diploma. Whereas, who learned from experience and practice at home, earns 25 dollars  each hour. In fact, if home-educated children decide to enrol themselves for any degree course in the near future, they are less likely to get a chance for admission.

In addition, school-going young people learn how to make friends and appropriate way of behaving with various persons present inside the campus. Moreover, adjustment quality in the tenacious situations has been developed by them. By working and playing with friends they learn leadership, teamwork, moral values, the significance of collaborative and collective work. All these skills assist them to enhance their level of competency and capacity as well as improvement of their cognitive development. Research published by the study committee of India displays that offspring taught by teachers are highly sociable and skilled as compare to others, who are grown up in the homely environment, for instance. Besides, a young mind will be deprived of having all the fun activities and above-mentioned qualities, which everyone should have, to lead a successful life.

To recapitulate, I am a firm believer in the fact that this ongoing escalating trend has severe detrimental impacts on an individual’s life. The importance of educational institutions is indispensable and everybody should taste that life in order to obtain the goal of developing healthier pursuits.",8,7.5
"The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other private vehicles.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","New environmental problems are arising daily and they are causing a great deal of stress to the world. Many of our environmental issues arise due to low air quality index. I agree that reducing the accessibility to fuel for private vehicles can solve many of our environmental problems. 

Private cars are one of the most preferred media of transport, while they are very convenient and personal they are also a major contributing factor to carbon dioxide emission which is harmful to the earth's ozone layer as well as causes lower air quality index. While people want to keep their independence of transport it is necessary to take precautionary actions to keep the earth safe for our upcoming generations. 

Increasing fuel prices can contribute greatly towards healing the earth, as it will motivate people to use public transport instead of private to save them money. The ozone layer will be less affected by lower CO2 emissions, and the refinery working to extract fuel will work for fewer hours and thus contribute towards a greener environment. An indirect benefit this price increase will yield is towards the bad situation of the traffic as there will be fewer private vehicles. While the fuel prices will go up it will also save money on car maintenance as people will use their cars less than normal and require minimal care.

However, increasing fuel prices will affect all areas of our life such as; the cost of transportation will increase. This will result in goods being expensive but with all the fuel money saved by using public transport, it will even out the effect. 

In conclusion, I think increasing fuel prices will benefit our environment as well as help us eliminate many health complications. It will also contribute towards helping us eliminate issues like traffic and maintenance of private vehicles.",5,6.0
"Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.
When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.
Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.
Having discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person.",9,8.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","More and more human beings think that people can do small to increase application nature.Only public and huge fabrics can make a real difference.From my way of thinking,humans can make a lot of things for the environment.This essay agrees that also people can make many beneficial works for  the environment.

Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that environmental issues are needed to be solved strictly by the government's policy of increasing the cost of private vehicles. Personally, it is a useful measure, but other measures might be more effective.

There are some underlying reasons why authorities should make an effort to raise petrol prices. Firstly,  it would limit the number of car journeys and the money raised could be used to improve public transport. Because of the sharp rise in appearance and convenience of cars, humans forget the harmfulness of using their vehicles related to the environment. Therefore, the government should upgrade and expand public transport provided by the cost of private vehicle users. Moreover, more goods would travel by rail. It is clear that freight services and the useful solution former would reduce vehicle emissions and the greenhouse effect.

Apart from the practical measures mentioned above, I believe that other solutions are more effective. There are more and more traffic jams happening on the road daily, especially during rush hours. In this situation, congestion charges should be the best idea to improve transport infrastructure.For instance, London's government used this method to avoid traffic congestion influenced directly by transport facilities. Additionally, free bus and train passes are other measures that helped to reduce the use of cars and improve air quality. Local authorities should subsidize the cost of fares to encourage people in using public transport. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that it's useful to raise taxes on petrol, but other transport measures would be more effective to help the environment.",8,7.5
"Interview form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are better methods. To what extent to you agree or disagree?","Employers follow a wide variety of screening methods to identify the best candidate. Although interviews continue to be the most common process, there are several other trusted methods in the contemporary era. I am of the opinion that a blend of interviews and other screening methods should be the criteria for selection. 

With the advent of the internet and enhanced global travel, job seekers have the ability to search for the desired job, resulting in an increased number of job applicants for each job posting. As a result, conducting interviews for each candidate may not be feasible and recruiters must discover alternate screening methods by considering the nature of the jobs. For instance, in technology companies, candidates are given scenarios to code and the final outcome will be evaluated. Therefore, the additional evaluation will not only provide the employers with  confidence but also reduce the count of applicants for interviews.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.
","Children are the backbone of every country. So, there are people who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will results in flourished society and individualistic growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

To begin with, social work by children can be easily associated with personality development because during this drive, they tend to communicate with variety of people, leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance, patience, team spirit, cooperation can be learnt. Besides that, young mind serve the country with full enthusiasm that gives them feeling of fulfillment and self-satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brim them with self-confidence and patriotic feeling. Moreover, going and experiencing multiple culture and tradition make their horizon so broad that add one more feather in their cap.

However, it is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate indifferent curriculum activities, endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers and in competitive world they should not be expected to serve society without their self-benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment in their mind.

In conclusion I believe, notion of teenager doing unpaid work is indeed good but proper monitoring and care should be given to avoid untoward consequences.

Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"It is often a debated topic that artificially intelligent robots will progressively replace 

human tasks in the workplace. Although, it is evident that most menial jobs will be done by robots; however, it is unlikely that jobs that require human touch will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.

To begin with, It is admittedly true that robots make some jobs easier to complete effectively which does not require specific and complex skills. Simple jobs that are repetitive and conditional in nature can be automated. This is the reason many companies are using robots these days to obviate the cost of manpower and increase their productivity. For instance, an Automated teller machine is used to withdraw and deposit cash in time which in turn tremendously eradicated  human interaction and save time. For these reasons, some unskilled work would be replaced by robot automation in the coming future. 

On the other hand, there are some human jobs that can never be superseded by robots because they will never achieve the capacity to do it. In other words, they require human cognitive touch. For example, jobs associated with education, medication, social work to name a few cannot be done by robots as they require qualities like emotion and intuition. Thus, many complex tasks that need human judgement cannot be replaced by robots and will continue to be done by humans. 

In conclusion, A significant amount of people's job will be

 conducted by artificial intelligence in the coming future. Unskilled labour work will eventually be replaced entirely by robots; however, it is not possible for them to replace all and jobs require complex skills and human touch will always exist.",5,6.0

I belive that small change in human activities can save global warming. In this esay i will disscuss both views and support my opinion with examples.

On the one hand, although change in weather is  increasing every moment and harming creatures ,some believe that it is huge and out of human control. It is a cause of natural process which is not a part of induvidual effort ,so it is better to learn live with this growing issues. In addition to this, one person is not responsible since they are busy working and  living their life. For example, every people in the planet have their own life work, study, business and family, so they can not take part on this evironmental matter.

On the other hand, many argue that it is a effect of human life style and needs to be eradicated by ourself.  It is a collective action of human towards the nature, so it is possible to control through a collective effort. Individuals can request government to make strong rules and regulation against climate change behaviours, we can support scientist to research more how to reduce the effect of emitted gas, or technologist who can invent equipment and machinary which could stop carbonemmision on the way to atmosphere. For example as tesla there can be onother invention which  can save environment by observing the texins and chemicals.

Parents should encourage children spend less time on studying and more time on doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree?,"guardians have to uplift juveniles to utilise leisure time on academic study instead of spending more time on sports activities, in my opinion, I agree with the given statement up to a great extent because with the help of physical activity adolescence can learn new skills to survive in society as well as children will develop their personality however study is the key route for success in life

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by the artificially intelligent robots? what is your opinion?,"The artificially intelligent robots have been part of the society since it was created and today many of our daily tasks are possible because of it.  Some people argue that this field would overtake all the work done by humans. In my opinion, to an extent, it can be possible, however, there are some jobs that will still use the human labour  rather than using robots. 

To begin with, robots have overtaken many job positions currently. When it comes to companies which produce cars, technology and food, it is pretty likely to see robots in their production lines  performing  most of the duties,  because of the accuracy and  the efficiency that they have. One robot might do several tasks at the same time, whereas one person can possibly do only one task and require more time. Furthermore, the artificially intelligent robots provide various benefits. While employees need to get paid, vacations and insurances, robots will only require installation process and maintenance, which is pretty convenient for the company cost.

However, I believe that there are still some jobs that cannot be done by artificially intelligent robots. Firstly, the medical field is likely to remain requiring doctors. For instance, Although there are some robots that can undertake a surgery, the doctors are still domain most of the medical procedures and researches due to the complexity of the human body and their experience.  Secondly, the jobs regarding with the economy and administration are more likely to require people who can predict future crisis and economical approaches. In my opinion, robots are not prepared to undertake the duties of a project manager or stock analysis yet.  

In conclusion, although robots can be useful in production processes, I believe that some jobs will still remain done by humans. However, there is no doubt that in the future, artificial intelligence  will be a treat for the humanity.",9,8.0

Some people believe that climate change has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many topics we can gain from newspapers or social media and climate change is one of them. Nowadays, plenty of people assume climate change can increase the temperature of the earth so it forces people to adapt with that situation. Furthermore, the economy in the place where we live also makes us adjust our lifestyle to be fit with our environment. 

Climate change has been a hot topic lately since it gives great impact on humans and the most noticeable problem is an increasing of earth temperature. In Indonesia for instance, people who live in labelung, which is known as highland, need Air Conditioner (AC) and it's an adaptation done by humans to keep feeling cold. Climate change not only can affect temperature but also it makes messy weather schedule.This random weather creates new habits that are made so people can go their whole lives without being bothered by the weather.  Workers who always bring their umbrella and consume vitamins are behaviors that came from random weather problems.

People who live in Jakarta and people who live in Semarang surely has different lifestyles and it because the rate of economy there. Region where have high rate economy make sellers can sell their products with high price as they know people who live there can afford to buy it. Same way of selling can not applied in low rate economy region. That different makes people need to adjust their lifestyle to place where they live. For example, Semarang people only need Rp 10.000 to get Nasi Padang (Indonesia traditional food) but in Jakarta you need to spend as much money as Rp 1300 to get the same food. Not only that, the economic rate in a region also give impact to the government about the tax rate. 

Either climate change and region economic rate can affect people’s live. In my own opinion climate change give more impact compared region economic rate since climate change could involve to world community but region economic rate only affects that region.",3,5.0
Pollution and other environmental damages are caused by a country developing and becoming richer.  This problem cannot be avoided.  To what extent do you agree?,"Some people argue that it is impossible for developing countries to further develop without damaging the environment. In their opinion, economic growth should be the first priority of the government. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, economic growth is important, but it cannot be at the expense of the environment.


To commence with, when nations develop, they will require more resources. For example, developing countries like India and China need more fuel to power their growth. To explain, excessive consumption of fossil fuels, unfortunately, leads to the emission of carbon dioxide and accelerates the rate of global warming. Countries could better handle this problem if they start developing sustainable sources of energy.

Another point to consider is that, all countries should invest in green and clean energy sources. For example, in nations lying on either side of the equator there is considerable potential for harnessing solar energy. Countries that produce excess amount of green energy can sell it to other countries. Rich nations that are technologically and scientifically more advanced should share the newer and greener technologies with poor and developing nations for a better tomorrow.

Finally, Environmental problems are not limited to any particular country and it is foolish to claim that only those nations that pollute should do something about it. Before long, the impact of pollution caused by rapidly developing nations will also be felt in the developed world.

To conclude, since our survival depends on the environment, we cannot ignore environmental problems on the pretext that they are a byproduct of development. Of course, there is a need for development, but it is time we said no to developing nations will also be felt in the developed world.",7,7.0
"Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes
delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative
development?","Education for universities always developing and changing for students to study easily without worrying about anything and nowadays they offer online classes for the one who cannot attend regularly because of difficult transportation or far distances. And I believe that this trend has so many benefits for everyone with current situations.

    Although online classrooms are already available in some universities since the covid-19 pandemics has happened, after that, almost every universities in the world have online courses now. By teaching from online, students does not need to care for physical contacts and focus only on studying and even they are sick or ill they no longer need to be restrained by fearing of infecting other people. Moreover, they will have more free time as there is no more transportation to get to the destination place because we can learn from the home with comfort. Also, students can now study from any universities from anywhere in the world despite their home countries.

    There are still left advantages for this phenomenon beside aforementioned ones. For example, because of the fees for online learning are always cheaper than learning on campus, people with tighter finance can now afford for their desire subjects. However, whether many of positive facts are existed, few drawbacks of this phenomenon also need to be considered. The most crucial thing is that there will be less practical practices for students compared to the campus and it is not possible for them to learn and practice in practical subjects from online. Lastly, there are still people who prefer more campus than online for the reasons which they think they feel unsatisfied and not effective learning from online.

"some people belive that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

what is your opinion","It is believed by some people that artificially intelligent robots will soon take over humans’ part in the workforce. Even though menial jobs could indeed be replaced by robots, it is not quite possible for the artificial intellect to replace humans in careers that require human contact. This essay will discuss the reasons why eventually only robots would be working in most positions and if people are still needed in the work field.

Robots with artificial intelligence would carry out most operations that do not require specific skills or human relations. Due to the fact that hiring people would be far more expensive than robots, many companies might turn to artificial intelligence. Furthermore, companies will not need to train their robots, unlike humans who might take a lot of time to learn how to get the job done. in Saudi Arabia, for instance, most banks have switched to automated teller machines, since it is much more convenient and it works around the clock. Therefore any job that could possibly be replaced by robots will be replaced eventually. 

However, there are certain human professions that cannot be replaced by a robotic intelligence. And that is because these specific tasks require human relations and strong communication skills, such as psychology, medicine and education. Artificial brilliance will not be able to achieve these social skills that the society itself is still developing.

To conclude, the  future of robotic intellect is quite promising. For it is possibly going to end most human employment. unskilled and lowly jobs will eventually be done by robots only ,However there are still many sophisticated professions that the artificial skill will never be able to maintain. In the end, only a few human jobs would still be done by humans.",5,6.0

 positive development, whereas others consider it negative. Discuss both sides and give your

opinion.","Nowadays, the criteria defining a successful person has changed a lot in our society. Although, history has many examples of people who were not famous however they were successful in their respective fields. In my perspective, success is defined by a persons ability to perform their duties and not by the fame or the assets they possess.

Firstly, few people in the society might decline the fact that many people who are successful might not be famous. They might be at the top of their race because of their sheer tenacity. For example, recently I met an old man while I was waiting to board a bus from the Kashmir police station. He was sitting beside me when I asked him for a bus number which will help me to reach my destination. This is when our conversation started. During our conversation, I realized that the man sitting beside me is one of the top players in the securities trading industry. He had a turnover of around 400cr a year. Despite being successful, not many people know him in our country.

Besides, Society knows just a handful of people who are famous because of the media influence. For example, Elon Musk and Jack ma. These people are famous because they have bought a revolution in their respective industries by surprising the masses with their innovation. Also, they had the skills and ability to communicate with society in such a manner that one might get completely convinced with their ideas. They have shown the tremendous power of effective communication to the world.

To conclude, people who are successful are indeed rich in our society however It may not be necessary that they are famous and well known around the world.",9,8.0

First and foremost, by involving in unpaid work for the public young people gets the benefits in career aspects. The extra-curricular activity adds up to the resume and helps to boost the career opportunities.

To begin with,the primary reason volunteering will benefit the young generation is it helps them improve their social skills.While some are outgoing,others are shy.It connects them with people day in and day out so they are able to improve their communication as well as adapt to working in a group.For example, I was an extrovert however when I joined volunteering am now an introvert .Hence ,it helps to overcome shyness.Moreover ,it helps prevent diseases. They clean choked gutters and discard empty cans to prevent disease.To exemplary,there is has been no new cases of malaria in the Adiembra community as a result of free sanitation  done by their teenagers.

Secondly,another  advantage of voluntary work to the youth is it helps them gain career knowledge. Some youth get the chance to work in an organisation. Through ,volunteering they are able to learn job skills such as time management, planning and problem-solving.For instance ,Abu who wants to be a nurse knows how to dress a wound and serve medications because of working for free in Adiembra Hospital...Although they do not pay them ,  social benefits.Therefore ,unpaid services help teens to gain field experience.

Many jobs that used to be done by humans are now being done by machines. Does this development bring more advantages or disadvantages?,"More often machines replace humans to do their jobs. There is no consensus in society is it positive or negative development. Some of them say that robots are better then people, because they are doing work faster and without mistakes. But, on the contrary, it extent to unemployment. So, in my opinion it is a bad trend. So I will try to prove you that with examples of The Goverment of Ukraine report and professor Jan Danilov's research.

The first reason why this development bring more disadvantages, is that many workers are losing their jobs because they are replaced by machines. For example, report of Ukrainian Goverment said that more and more jobs that used to be done by humans are now being done by machines. For instance, for the last 5 years the number of workers  had decreased by 13 percent. So this is the first reason why i think it is a bad trend.

The second example why this is negative development proved by professor Jan Danilov. In his research he studied how people and machines doing the same job and he came to conclusions that pay workers are cheaper then buy machines for it. So this is another reason why replacing humans by technological devices is a bad tendency.

In conclusion I think it is a negative development when many jobs that used to be done by humans are now being done by machines. In my opinion it is a negative trend and society should choose people instead robots.",5,6.0
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","There has been a rising trend that people in some nations are curious about the origins of their residential properties. From my perspective, they are eager to look into the family origin as a part of human qualities (curiosity) and there are multiple ways to do this. In this essay, I will discuss some factors that drive a person to do this and recommend some methods that help.

First, human is among the most curious species in the world and always feels the need to connect to the community where he used to know. This is no exception when it comes to tracing back the origin of their residing house. For example, a friend of mine came back to his own house after years of working abroad and he looks forwards to reuniting with his neighbored friends as a way to reconnect to the community expanding his circles which may be beneficial for his later employment.

And there are various ways we can take this into account. One of which is to inquire about the surroundings about all the aspects of your house in the past. Another tactic is to scan through the family tree record, there is a high possibility that some interesting facts about the property are described and inscribed. Finally, we can always seek help from the local authorities where all the household information and even major events are archived.

In short, it is totally understandable that human tends to trace back the origin of their residing area as a way to reconnect to the past. Indeed, we are incentivised to do this through a wide range of methods, such as consulting the local authority or the nearby neighbourhood or even our relatives.",6,6.5

Some pupils are cruel, they humiliate others for different behaviour. In this situation, it's better to teach children at home for the reason of avoiding future psychological problems. Additionally, there is another significant advantage of home teaching. This is more attentive to teachers. School teachers have a lot of tasks and pupils to teach. Following this, they don't have opportunity to pay attention and find approach for everyone. That's why, a lot of children don't study at all. In contrast to that, children who study at home have all attention. As a result, they have more qualified education
On the other hand, schools have some privilege too, such as a social environment and a certified education system. School is not only a study place, it's also a place where you can learn to be part of society. The children are surrounded by people of their age, it helps them to develop normally. Another thing, parents can make up schedules by themselves and remove important subjects. It is inappropriate way of teaching. In contrast to  schools have an exact system that is tested by professionals.

Taking everything into account, there is the advantage of home teaching, such as the quality of education and disadvantages, such as the lack of needed social circumstances and a suitable system. Personally, I think there are more benefits and it's better to teach children at home",4,5.5
Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"As natural resources are under increasing pressure, the list of endangered animals and plants is becoming endless. While some might claim that nothing could be done to reverse the trend, I believe that there are still means to ensure a sustainable future for the planet. 

Biodiversity contributes to humanity’s most important life-supporting safety net: nutrition, shelter, clothing, the very water we drink, and the air we breathe. However, our safety net is stretched almost to the breaking point. It is reported that natural forest area continues to decline, marine ecosystems are undermined severely, and countless species are suffering from illegal poaching. Hence, there are increasing voices that question the necessity and viability of making a change. 

Nevertheless, to reverse biodiversity decline, I believe, is still feasible, though difficult. 

Governments could promote a greater understanding of plants and animals by investing in the research and preservation efforts of universities, zoos, and botanical institutes. This may ensure the survival of individual species and produce tangible benefits in the form of new medicines and products. 

An alternative strategy would be to protect natural habitats by expanding nature reserves. This would have immediate positive consequences for those areas by preserving delicate ecosystems. The most effective solution is to limit the damage at the source. Companies that engage in practices that harm the environment should be required to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable efforts to minimize the damage. Public contracts for roads and buildings should only be awarded to firms that have a good environmental track record. The strategies outlined above could do much to reverse the destruction that threatens the world’s plants and animals. 

To conclude, a planet being pushed to the edge will eventually turn on us. 

With the accelerating rate of mass extinctions of plant and animal species, I believe, effective measures should be taken immediately to make a difference.",6,6.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented growth of homeowners showing propensities for having a deep knowledge about the history of a place they live such as: house, building, and so on. This essay attempts to shed light on the driving force behind the curtain before outlining a number of methods people can discover their accommodations' past.

To commence with, there are several reasonable explanation for why people are inclined towards understanding the advent of their house. The key rationale is associated with some concerns over potential building problems. It is essential for owners to examine past records involved to the house like when it built, what its outline was or how long it existed . In other words, most important information can be verified. Moreover, some people keen on exploring that high-quality products are used, for instance, ancient artifacts or pottery items. Another significant reason is beliefs of homeowners, especially for some Asian countries. In fact, the older generations tend to believe that the former owners or some events happened before will have considerable influences on the fortune of their own . As an example, if the prior owners was a successful person, they are likely to succeed afterwards.

In the light of the aforementioned reason, accommodators have an ability of figuring out the information in two simple ways. First and foremost, having a meeting with the former dwellers and neighbors about the secrets of their house. In fact, these trusted sources would be beneficial to give insights on incidents, which do wonders for current landlord to prevent upcoming troubles. Secondly. due to a momentous technological leap, homeowners are capable of doing research about the construction stage or major occurences in the past. Thus, it is easier to make an decision to leave or not.

In conclusion, some compelling reasons can be witnessed to a surge of tenants being interested to discover the origin of their house or buiding. Additionally, it is possible for them to do some research about their accommodation as well.",6,6.5
Some people find advertisements amusing or annoying and they are not influenced by this when they shop. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Advertising and its influences have long been a topic of numerous debates, especially in recent years. In this regard, some people argue that the impact of advertisements on shoppers is neglectable. However, in contrast, the majority number of people including me hold the view that advertisements could channel the shoppers' choices in an effective way. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will support this point of view with likely explanations.

To begin with, it is widely accepted that the modern human is leading a consumerism lifestyle due to indulging in social media platforms and being bombarded with commercials offering an excessive range of products. This means that huge enterprises meticulously target individuals, particularly younger consumers, with impressive adverts on social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram. As a result, this level of omnipresence of new products with gimmick options makes it inevitable for young people who spend most of their time surfing the internet. The latest statistics in the UK, for instance, have demonstrated that nearly 60% of people who spend a certain time on the internet buy at least one or two items every month under the direct influence of online advertisements. 

Furthermore, the fact advertisements could be functional in terms of making customers aware of various features, options and models of available products in the market. Thanks to the informative form of adverts, people have an opportunity to compare different items they need in terms of prices and features to make the best decision, which would have not been possible otherwise. This trend is quite beneficial for both individuals and companies as it increases sale figures and boost the economy in society. Apart from that, driven by advertisements, the time devoted to shopping sprees has diminished substantially due to the fact that before attending the malls or shops people exactly know which items and brands they want to purchase. For example, when I have to buy a mobile phone I  do not waste my time in the shop since, thanks to the adverts and pops on the Internet, I am already familiar with the exact features, costs and quality of every available smartphone in the market which makes the process of buying in the shop significantly lower.

To sum up, despite the fact that a minority group of people do not trust adverts anyway, in my opinion, most people, especially younger ones are affected by advertisements since not only it could enhance their knowledge about different goods but also  can stimulate demand and interest to newly produced items.",7,7.0
"some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. however, others believe that they can gets news better through other media platforms. discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowadays, a large number of people tend to buy items such as clothes, cars and other things from reputable companies. The reasons will be discussed in this essay and in my opinion, this trend both has advantages and drawbacks in equal measure.

There are several causes of why more and more people prefer owning luxurious products. Firstly, due to the beliefs on personal possession reflecting wealth, personal status and appearance, many people use clothes, accessories from a popular brand. For example, many consumers buy shoes from Nike or Adidas because it helps them to enhance their appearance. Another reasons are that exorbitant-priced products of famous brands are made of expensive materials and unique feature, so they are always high-qualified, highly durable. Using these goods would bring more comfort to the users and also save more money in the long period than massive products.

On the other hand, the increasing number of people buying good items from large enterprises can bring both benefits and disadvantages to the business world. Countries, where famous brand are based on, are more likely to have strong an healthy economy. The US - the home of many famous brands such as Apple or Microsoft, for instance, has been the most powerful economic since the late 20th century when the products of these organizations are not only popular in domestic but also favored in foreign nations. However, the rise in the number of large brand names can lead to the monopoly as they will attempt to dominate and wipe out small rivals to maintain their positions.

In conclusion, the tendency of consuming goods from famous brands comes from people’s perception of personal belongings showing their fortune and the high qualification for those expensive products. This trend has a positive and negative effect on the business market",5,6.0
"Some people think that the best way to become successful in life is to get a university education, whereas others say this is no longer true. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion","individuals believe that the great method to achieve successful is academic institutions, while others believe that we have good at to skill and having natural talent which can help to gain progression. This essay will be discuses both of aspect with my perspective.

There is a lot of arguments that why people want to finish their tertiary school. Firstly, a number of people would like to become a doctor, engineer and other fields. In which is essential part of our life to dream come to true.  If a member of society to complete their listen then they don’t have any problem to get a job For instance amazon, people which are interesting in a getting job than they will have to show their degree. Learning education can help them for those who are interested a field job.

On the other hand, education university is nit deciding to your success, it has another reason behind this statement. TO began with it, it’s possible without to finish out college that we can access successful in our daily life for example mark Zaalberg one a person who create fb. He dropped out university so his wealthy was as bel gate.

To sum up in my perspective, academic degree is better way to accomplish, this because people who have higher education are more likely to have a good career in the future and the can have a good service for society in the medical are.

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","In  recent years, the number of vehicles on the road has climbed up considerably. This has immediately been an issue for many countries. This problem has its sources as well as ideas to remedy it.

To begin with, a significant percentage of the population around the world have their own vehicle. Each family has at least one or two cars. These people benefit from it as a mode of transport to commute to their destinations such as workplace, shopping mall or at their relative's place. Few of them would go by bus or take the metro. They find it easier and more comfortable to travel in their own car. On the other hand, companies that offer delivery services usually use countless goods vehicles. This ultimately leads to traffic congestion on the roadway. Now, in some countries,  road development is quite poor. The street is sometimes narrow or has cracks. Consequently, this also contributes to a high rate of traffic.

One measure that can be taken is to sensitize the car owners. They should be encouraged to travel by bus rather than using the car more often. The government could take initiatives like lowering the bus fare or increasing the frequency of buses on the road. A sustainable idea could be offering each family a bicycle motivating them to consider other means of transport. Also, they should try to solve this issue by implementing and building highways with more lanes as well as using more durable materials to construct the roads. Last but not least, companies need to find a way to change the working shifts for their employees. Thereby, decreasing the density of workers and the number of vehicles.

To conclude, traffic jams can only be eradicated if the causes are taken into considerations. The government could play a huge role in resolving this problem.",8,7.5
The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions,"It is true that technologies have become in popularity and they have swirled a controversy in wealth gap. While a number of people believe that the development of digital era rise the disparity between upper and lower class, I would argue that it can be the opposite trend.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why some considers there is an enormous discrepancy in these classes because of technology growth. Firstly, the most modern technologies are frequently invented for upper class. Going abreast of high quality, the price of these high-tech innovations seems only reaches the rich, which is over effort of the poor. Luxurious cars namely Maybach or Ferrari might support this idea. Furthermore, in term of medical sector, although the medical facilities and treatments are innovated to prescribe for patients, the expenses are incredible increasing so that solely the prosperous can be affordable. For example, in Corona virus pandemic, most of the impoverished suffered from pain and passed away owing to the lack of breathing supported equipment. 
On the other hand, I believe that technologies enhance a beneficial effect on narrowing discrepancy between the wealthy and deprived people. Technologies and the Internet is beginning viral to all social classes and it is likely for the lower class to become rich now. A lot of Vietnamese farmers namely Mrs Tan Vlog and Mr Ba Vlog can earn a tremendous amount of money from their cooking videos which are popular in the Internet. Plus, thanks to the spread of wireless, people regardless background can be able to access international knowledge from their smart gadgets, which is totally different compared to the past. From all these ideas, it is clear that the technologies’ advancement will lead to greater equality. 
In conclusion, although both views have certainly have some validity, I it seems to me that the gap between well off people and who live in poverty will be decreased with the development of technologies.",3,5.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In today's time, human activities are having an extreme effect on climate change of our planet and some people think that rather than taking measure's to prevent humidity change, we should learn to live with it. I firmly disagree with this opinion, and in this essay, I will provide a certain example's to back my argument.

These days, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at there highest levels since the past thousand's of years. This has caused many problems. For instance, people who live in polluted cities have difficulty in breathing, low fertility rate, lower life expectancy among infants and much more. All this combined with global warming and man-made pollution has made it extremely difficult for nature to maintain it's rest configuration. All this has caused drastic changes to occur in our planet's climate, which can also cause many natural habitats to go extinct. Under such circumstances, only us humans will be able to adapt to the temperature changes, but not other species.

For example, consider the case of fishes. The continuous increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the vapourisation of polar ice caps. This has lead to an increase in  sea levels around the world. In such circumstances, the amount of human waste deposition into the sea and oceans around the world has also increased which has led to the deaths of countless fishes in these waters. Moreover, in some instances, these fishes were found to be dead on the shore of beaches and some found to be floating dead on the surface of the water. This is just one of the few examples that go on to show, that although humans will be able to adapt to all the temperature changes and find a way to live with these changes, majority of the animal kingdom population won't be able to do the same.

So in a nutshell, instead of finding a way to live with the changing temperature, one should look for ways to minimize it. By doing so, we won't only be saving our own natural habitat, but we will also be creating a more stable and livable environment for the future generation's to come.",10,8.5
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Concentrating on lessons is one of the most common problems for a lot of pupils at schools. There are some reasons  why is this happening and also the solutions for them which will be discussed in this essay. 

  The first reason for the absence of concentration are subjects that are taught in a monotonous way. In such case, kids get distracted by other things they bring to school from home. For instance, in our era of technology, even elementary school students have a phone or tablet where there are numerous apps and games. As a result, a child pulls the phone out of his pocket as soon as the lesson gets boring. The solution is for the teacher to engage students in different interactives to better grasp the topics. This method will decrease children’s interest in participating in discussion and hols their attention. 

  Another reason is a teacher’s approach to everyone. Situations, when no attention is paid to some students, occur frequently and as a result, a kid starts doing anything but not listening to the pedagogue. However, if some kids can tell their parents about that type of accident, there are some who does not. Moreover, somebody can even believe it is normal behaviour for a teacher. For instance, some teachers can offend students because they do not meet the standards they imagine in their heads. To tackle this issue, the entire teaching staff ought to attend psychologist sessions before starting to work with children. 

  In conclusion, both problems can be solved if the efforts are made, especially when a person likes the job and is ready to do anything to involve pupils in the process of education.",8,7.5
"some think most crime is the result of circumstances, e.g., poverty and other social problems. Others believe that most crime is caused by people who are bad by nature. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Receiving, the topic of criminal sense is the product of being treated in  abysmal conditions, while others think that unacceptable behaviours create crime. From the prior experience, this writer argues that social factors affect human beings due to careless childhood.

It is vital to understand that human nature can be adversely affected during growing age. Take an example of once people around a child did some pulling actions, which can be noticed by the young and the would likely act in the same way to the others. This leads to the standard of bad habits and they can even cause some potential risks of being a murderer at an early age. Hence, parents should put their children in a safe zone in order to prevent some miserable things around them.

As this point may be true, yet, once criminals acted, they knew what they were doing was wrong, but their habits made them think  what they did was for the right purposes. This is because crime's behaviours are not being punished ever since they have made a few mistakes. Not far from the fact that people will do anything to protect their best things even though they have to break the law. Thus, it can not be given to the crime is created by their nature.

It is this writer's opinion that people need well-education, which concludes mental health. It can be self-evident that the community is responsible for the youngster's behaviour, let the children walk in the right path. Therefore, people, especially children should not  lack  attention.

Taking all points into account, society's actions can lead a potential criminal as well  humans ought to remember what they have done and defend the roots of crime once it happens.",2,4.5
"Some people believe that watching TV is bad for children, while others claim it has positive effects for children as they grow up. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While it is widely claimed that watching TV is beneficial for children when they become adults, some argue that TV is bad for offspring. Both points of view and the reason why I believe that TV has more positive effects than negative will be elaborated on this essay.

To begin with, it might seem sensible for some to believe that TV consumption is bad for children. This is possibly because there is some inappropriate content on TV, for instance, in action films, there is violent behaviour such as fighting, shooting, or robbing, and kids who consume that content can imitate those which is not good for society at large.

On the other hand, opponents of this idea might propose that there are positive effects on TV. To put in other words, educational programs on TV can supply learning materials for children, for example, they can learn English through English language cartoons, certain shows can enhance creativity and imagination, and exposure to different cultures.

Personally, I would argue in favour of positive effects, because when I was young, I learned the English language via cartoons on a cartoon network channel, and this is a fun way to learn, unlike learning at school. In school, kids might find that learning new languages is hard because some teachers teach their students in a stressful way. 

In conclusion, althought it is undeniable that kids should not watch TV, I am of the opinion that watching TV has more positive than negative effects for a children.",4,5.5
"Some People believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots
what is your opinion?","Artificially intelligent robots rather than people will do all of the jobs. While it is possible that artificial robots will perform all types of jobs except robotic technology.  Hence this essay will discuss why particularly all of the jobs will undertake robots than human beings.
In these days, many jobs are undertaken by artificially intelligent robotic machines.  Cumbersome repetitive tasks are difficult for any people, therefore it is better to get it done by robotic machines. For example, all of the work in manufacturing foundries is done by robotic arms without any rest, which lead to maximum profit at large scale in a short span of time. For these reasons, robots will eventually replace almost jobs performed by humans in the upcoming future.
Conversely, artificial robotic machines cannot replace few jobs unless they learn that as well. Human beings only know progressing in robotic technology, which outnumbers the artificial robots. For example, developing new algorithms for making artificial intelligent robots, which shall be developed by expert human beings. Because of that major reason, it is in believing, that artificial robots due to their limited functional capacities will not do those jobs that require human knowledge.
Some people believe that artificially intelligent robotic machine will perform all of the jobs except those, which require complex level knowledge.  All of the repetitive work may be handled by the robots, however, the people will do where the complex development is necessary.  In my opinion, I believe that the robotic machines will perform all of the laborious jobs while the expert skilled peoples will do other jobs that require cognitive thinking ability.",6,6.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that it would be preferable to create a solution in order to adapt to climate change. As well as, individuals have to stop investigating how to ban it. Nevertheless, I completely feel vice versa with the aforementioned. Due to the fact that both humans and the environment will be damaged. The reasons why people should prevent temperature change will be highlighted in the following lines.

 

To commence with, the supporters of the prior viewpoint assume that climate change and humans cannot live together due to they might be harmful. To contribute more, the increase in temperature will result negatively on citizens' health. Therefore, hospitals might be full of sick patients. Accordingly, the rate of death people rises. As an illustration, it was noticed this year developing of temperature degree in various countries. Consequently, many individuals died due to that. 

On the other hand, the holders of the previous thought argue that changes in weather would affect the environment negatively. To elaborate more, as the world gets warmer a noticeable effect might be seen in the green forces. Based on that, a decline in the proportion of O2 will be ubiquitous. Hence, the whole world will be yellow ( desert). Thus, a great number of animals will be victims. On an account of this, the rate of food will be diminished. 

To conclude, although there are individuals who support that living with climate change should be possible, it has unbelievable drawbacks for both humans and nature. According to the above-mentioned, citizens should work to reveal findings to neglect the weather changes.",3,5.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"MY OWN QUESTION FOR TASK 2: People living in the twenty-first century have a better quality of life than
people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people’s quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.
In conclusion, I believe that people living in the 21st century have a better quality life than the past.",7,7.0
"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that an interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is undeniable that most companies rely on interviews for hiring new employees, but some people believe that this dependence on interviews is wrong and that other alternatives should be preferred as they are better. I believe that interviews are a reliable method, and the other methods cannot be considered more effective.

There are many reasons why interviews are suitable for hiring new employees. Firstly, through the interview, the recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential employees. In interviews, there is face-to-face interaction, and the candidates have to answer impromptu questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking some case study-type questions, employees can judge traits like the ability to handle pressure, confidence and the ability to think outside the box.

In addition, although there are many other methods for hiring, none of them could be considered superior to interviews. One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the theoretical knowledge of the person. However, this method cannot give a good idea about the personality of the candidate. By contrast, through interviews, employers can judge both the knowledge and temperament of the potential employee. Moreover, the written test is fallible to cheating as sometimes candidates can take outside help.

Another selection process is a group discussion, which is good where a major job requirement is conversational and persuasion skills for instance sales jobs. They are really not suited for technical jobs because these are not customer oriented. On the other hand, interviews hold good for any type of job as the interviewer can frame questions to test the particular skills they require.

To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the preference for interviews for hiring among employers is justified as interviews have advantages over other commonly adopted methods.",6,6.5
Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's modern world, advancement in technology development has provided many ways to marketers of promoting their products and services to the public. For example, Tv ads, and online ads on video streaming websites, these ads are cluttered everywhere which in my opinion ultimately leads to a negative impact on behaviour and our mindset.

To begin with, the advertiser usually promotes consumerism, which anchors on buying frequently. we are always told to buy new clothes, and stay trendy, or we won't look cool without buying the latest iPhone. These advertisements create a habit that negatively affects individual financial status. moreover, they use stereotypes, through advertising, they create a feeling toward how a certain group of people should look like. For example, beauty creams tailored towards women, try to project the white colour of a woman as superior to the other colour, and women must accept this projection that the media portrays and consider this as having higher status. 

Additionally, mind cluttering everywhere you see you may find an advertisement. In current times people desire to make their life as simple as possible, but due to this factor, we ultimately process thousands of information daily. Furthermore, with misleading details, companies often make products look amazing through their advertising design and stories. But it doesn't perform as described in the ads most of the time. Additionally, adverts generally create low self-esteem by manipulating thoughts and by persuading you to buy products that will make you happy.

To conclude, in my opinion, advertising deteriorates our mental health and sometimes gives us an unprecedented daily lifestyle dent. As most people are blindly following the trends without thinking about their consequences.",1,4.0

Some people argue that, the role of socialize started to fade because highly developed technologies has undergone many changes, from the time the there were not harmful and dirty sides of internet.In these days when people can face with a lot of problems, as crimes, thefts and violences, which are happening through using of internet.For example, in Mexico, burglars stole about 2million dollars through access of online banking, in addition, currently, the government of Mexico are suffering from bankruptcy, because thousands of people returned or closed their bills, as a result, millions of employers lost own position.
On the other hand ,social media also impact people behaviour, mainly Facebook and Instragram alter minds of people, furthermore, now more than ever, people become antagonistic and the proportion of camaraderie also decreased, especially, teens suffer from this problem.Currently, significantly larger number of youngsters addicted to mobile phones in our worldwide, certainly it is pity for our generation.Besides, we use technology devices more than the limit in average adults need to use phones less than 2,5hours, but, currently, normal resident is utilizing more than 5 hours, it is becoming fashion or trend for them.For example, every they post one picture in instagram or change with new ones, if though they superstar, it depends also depend on children's behaviour, as well.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is argued that youth should spend their spare time doing free-of-cost services in society. I strongly agree with this point of view and this essay will shed light on this notion.

To begin with, there are various benefits of community service for adolescents. The predominant one is that this develops the spirit of teamwork among them. While working in a team, quality of cooperation inculcates among them which helps them to become good citizens and hence, it is beneficial for both individuals and society.

Besides, it helps youth to develop many social skills. Communication skill is one of the important skill and is improved highly while performing community duties, which benefits them in their professions also. Another one is that they become open-minded and broaden their horizon. This makes them a more social person and they become able to analyse the social problems with logic, which is good for both world and individuals.

Furthermore, at this age, an individual is very energetic and this is a good way to channel this energy. In case, this energy is not utilised in right and productive works, then it will be used by them in wrong ways like taking revenge or robbery etc. So, it is required to give proper direction to their youth, which is eventually advantageous to adolescents and the community.

To conclude, performing community tasks without pay by youth is the best way to make them more skilful and to use their enthusiasm in the right direction.",4,5.5
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
To what extent do you agree?","Several nations today, consist of single-gender and mixed-sex schools for parents to choose. Though few people are in favor of girls/boys only schools, some guides express disagreeness and consider it to be disadvantageous later in lives of children. This essay agrees with the statement because attending a single-gender school will cause problems in their personal and professional lives. 

Due to very less communication with the opposite sex, one’s professional life is affected badly. A friend of mine, Maya, went to only-girls school and grew up to be shy and weak. Maya’s shyness makes her colleagues and boss feel that she is not capable of performing under cruel circumstances and hence not provide her any challenging tasks. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institutions, have proven to perform excellently under any critical situations. Hence, individuals who did not attend co-ed institutions are not able to grow and develop professionally.

Not only careerwise, but also single-sex school students suffer loss in personal lives in their adulthood. Opposite-sex shyness is proven to be one of the reason of anxiety and depression. But people who were mixed-gender schooled, have better social as well as personal lives. Being able to talk freely to the opposite gender make a good friend and a great companion. Yale University researchers have proven that single-sex schooled sons and daughters suffer more psychologically than co-educationally schooled ones. 

To conclude, mothers and fathers of many nations a option of choosing between mixed and single gender institutions and few people consider the latter as harmful. I agree with those people because it leads to social-shyness and awkwardness resulting in unsuccessful social, personal and professional lives.",3,5.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after graduating from high school. Discuss both view and give your opinion.","There is a debate regarding the most effective path to a successful career. Some individuals argue that pursing higher education at a university or college is the optimal route, while others contend that entering the workforce immediately after completing secondary education is more advantageous. This essay will discuss both point of view and explain my opinion.

Proponents of higher education assert that attending a university or college provides individuals with the necessary knowlege, skills and credentials to excel in their chosen field. They maintain that a degree from a reputable institution can open doors to more prestigious and higher-paying job opportunities. Moreover, some of job need high level education or skills and experience, depens on the position being applied for. Take for example, law, medicine and teaching, it is imposible to be consider for position without the required educational background.

On the other hand, those who advocate for entering the workfoce directly after school argue that practial experience is more valuable than the theoretical knowledge. They posit that on-the jobtraining  and real-work experience can provide individuals with a competitive edge in the job market. Therefore, in business, it would be more important for a candidate to have soft skills and experience in that line of business so they can step into a position without further training and be of immediate benefit to the association.

In my opinion, both paths have their merits and the most effective route to a successful career may vary depending on an individuals's personal circumstances, goals, and aspirations. Ultimately, it is important for people to carefully consider their options and make a informed decision that aligns with their long-term career objectives.",2,4.5
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.

Do you agree or disagree?","Voluntary work is often considered a win-win practice to benefit teenagers and society, while I cannot agree that all teenagers are required to do so, as if it is compulsory. 

The compulsoriness claiming that unpaid work should be teenagers’ mandatory duty is essentially a type of disrespectfulness to teenagers’ rights. Teenagers, as the majority of citizens, have the same rights as we all do, to make their own decisions on how to spend their free time. Considering that, voluntary work could be promoted among teenagers but should never be compulsory. To illustrate this, if there were actually regulations about mandatory unpaid work designated for teenagers, it is foreseeable that they would feel their rights offended, probably leading to petition and demonstration, or even worse conflictions in the local community.

Additionally, most unpaid work doesn’t help much with teenagers’ courses or career plans. For instance, a student who wants to be a graphic designer tends to accumulate his experience in art field while none of the existing voluntary vacancies is compatible with his career plan, which means, his free time fulfilled with voluntary work is indeed a waste of effort. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.

In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.",4,5.5

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What is the cause of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Society experiences a trend that the non-stop growing process of manufacturing items for users has an adverse influence on the eco-system. This essay will discuss about the main cause and a couple of solutions to tackle the issue.

On the one hand, the foremost reason that leads to a negative impact is due to an enormous amout of litter thrown away annually. The more goods are produced, the more garbage exist. It is easy to catch the moment that many tourists acquiring little education about environmental protection leave their own trash on roads and beaches. Not only people from tourisms but also local inhabitants that are not aware of collecting those garbage. Second, most of factories are utilizing unfriendly environmetally materials such as fossil fuels which may release hazardous emissions. For instance, the toxic smoke released into the atmosphere together with pollutants pumped directly to the sea can result in the air and water pollution.

However, the ways to handle this situation are varied. It is nothing but the duty of the government in protecting the ecology by setting obligatory. For example, the authorities are able to impose stricter punishment on companies that go to great lengths to produce things from bad materials such as nilon. Furthermore, local residents should also establish some environmental protection groups to launch campaigns like ‘gathering trash on a weekly basis’ and apply cutting-edge technologies to have proper packages for each product.

In conclusion, it is obvious that the reasons why the development of consumer goods does harm to the natural environment are owing to the huge wealth of litter and the toxic materials. However, there are several solutions such as enacting laws by the header and hightening people’ intellect from various green campaigns.",2,4.5
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Indeed, most people use vehicles that require fuel to work. Nowadays, increasing fuel costs wouldn't be adequate to solve environmental issues since the community would continue using primary and faster transport. In addition, other reasons are included for the ecological unbalance, such as the deforest, Agropecuario, humans, etc. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying solution.

First of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solve some of the issues. Said that, would be a good action by the factors to reduce the price of these types of vehicles. Additionally, more encouragement through some Public Policies made by the government and businesses with multimedia marketing to society starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or walk to their destinations instead of using the car. Second, a clear example that increasing fuel prices may not work is represented by the war between Russia and Ukraine, where the public continued filling their gas transport; instead, they only complained about the high costs.

Furthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products humans has been contributing to the increase in deforestation. Thus, with plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farm animals, like cows, goats, pigs, and chickens. These animals also pollute the land, rivers, and air on a large scale. On the other hand, another problem starts with the pollution everyone makes every day by not throwing the trash properly. This action impacts the whole cycle of nature and increases an environmental imbalance.

In general, changing other sectors of life, such as changes in vehicle engines and ecological reeducation, would help Mother Nature not to collapse in the future. In return for significant changes, the populations on Earth could start being healthier, and they should have more growth and a wider community.",9,8.0
Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively. Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.
Firstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.
Furthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.
On the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.
In brief, despite some short-term economic incentives, I strongly believe, as stated in the paragraphs above, that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary.",7,7.0
"Nowadays, families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, there is a growing trend of families moving to various foreign countries in search of work. Some people argue this could have negative impacts on children. However, I think moving abroad to endeavor results in their children’s exposing to foreign education systems and cultures.

From one side, a family moving abroad to job can cause some problems. First, taking children to other countries would have a negative impact on child psychology. To illustrate this, kids could take a long time to integrate into a new environment and culture, since they have to leave their close friends and family members contributing to their loneliness and homesickness. Second, learning a new language could be the biggest barrier to them. When they go to school in a foreign country, they could not be able to keep up with academic and linguistic ability of their new classmates. When their ability to acquire knowledge is decreased due to the language barrier at the beginning, this would lead them to feel stressed and disappointed in themselves.

On the other hand, working overseas and taking all their children to live with could bring various benefits to them. For one thing, working abroad would offer them better working opportunity to earn money and raise their child better. As a result, their families’ living standards and monthly salary would be improved, especially for those living in undeveloped countries. Therefore, their children will have a better living condition to develop. In addition, going to another country assist their kids to have a better education system. For example, some Vietnamese people move to many developed countries, because the school curriculum will help their children to enhance their knowledge and skills completely. This leads their kids to having a better future career when they grow up.

In conclusion, an increasing number of people migrating overseas to work are increasing these days, and they mostly bring their families to these countries. In my opinion, this contributes to more benefits to their children’s future if they can overcome the difficulties at the beginning.",9,8.0

Others, however, believe this situation will cost  respect and order in the classroom . I will explain this in an essay.

On the one hand, these days online education is very developing and high school pupils  improve their educational knowledge with e-learning. On the internet ,have a lot of online courses and these sources are free and very profitable. For example, enlistment sees a variety of online lessons on the internet in order to learn more about the topics taught by the workforce at an institution and learn about  things that their force did not say and they ask about these things and this state create competition between the faculty member and student. Furthermore, positive remarks and suggestions from high seminary recruitment can help  educators to design their lessons taking into account the interests and wishes of students.

On the other hand,  some people think teenagers are not minded as humans . They can be mainly based on their emotions. And that condition existence disaster of respect.

Some people think that  art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"it is an undeniable that the arts sometimes reflects the heritage of a country. It is a controversial issue that a segment of society assert that the arts are an indispensable subject for children at school; whilst, opponents opine that it is only a waste of time. This essay Will discuss both views along with my opinion before reaching to a reasonable conclusion. 

The most prominent reason that why people considering the art as an important subject is that in this modern era only a few people are paying great attention towards the arts, the being less popular, nowadays. To elaborate, individuals are depending on the hi-tech relics, only, which are very intuitive and life become more easy. They have no knowledge about the importance of craftsmanship. The other reason is that pupils will become more creative and become artists. For instance, the art has direct relation with the economy of a nation. The Craft is very beneficial for the economic growth. As, there are various kinds of the arts and these kinds  attract people throughout the world, and because of this, the number of tourists, to a rampant increase, by this, there will be an exorbitant growth of the economy of a nation. Thus, there a plethora of positives of  the arts.

In contrast, although, the craft is paramount, yet many people think that it is a waste of time. Firstly, less concentration on study. To explain, almost every child love to the craftsmanship and children always give preference to the arts instead of other subjects such as science, technology and these are of great significant subjects, which allows students to find a good job after graduation. Next, studying the arts does not leads to a successful career. It is easy to see that those days, more artists have been struggling to make living from selling their work of the arts.

In a nutshell, after thorough analysis, on this subject, I firmly believe that the arts are very essential for a motherland and the law enforcement agencies ought to be taken some steps to preserved the craft.",5,6.0

people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is am opinion that celebrities are known as for glamour and wealth are famous than achieve.While a reckon that this is a bad example for youngs,I believe that the others can occupy cool role models

 On the first hand, crucial meaning that many people do achieve without really hard working for it.Lots people ,who do not do correct hard-working,can take significant achieve by their opportunity.They may be inherited by money from parents,married to eminent partner,or they may be on gossip journals on a really TV projects.For example,Antonela Roccuzzo who is a wife of legendary football player Lionel Messi.She is rich and wife of the most famous player in the world.Antonelo goes to Messi's matches and morally support him.They have being married since 2017.The wife of football player became famous by her huslabel,but she did not exertion be herself.The allusion for young people is that success can be achieved easily,and their projects and school works are not necessary for it

On the other hand,there are as least as many examples to role models by hard working,whose accomplishments can be glorious example for young people.Musician,athletes,actors and social media stars make considerable achieve only by their really diligence.They work for more than 5-6 hours per day for their target and in the future they will get resultat of these endeavor.For example,Will Smith.He is one of the most famous people in the world.He tried to be on main roles and worked for result in the future.Nowadays,I believe that he earns millions of dollars lying at home being a celebrated and achieved actor.If the youth watch connection between trying and success,they will want to start their programmes and projects for their goal.Because,in my opinion that this type of celebrated talents can pull youth to the good side

Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead going directly to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages.,"It has been observed that the youth take a gap from their study after finishing their schooling instead of getting  admission at The University. There are several betterments and detriments to such a viewpoint. Both aspects are elaborated on further in the ensuing paragraph.

Discussing the benefits, the prime reward for travel is that the young guns can learn about the culture. By this,I mean that as student roams around the world during their break, they will learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. Therefore, they gain their approach to adapting new things into their life, and become  multilingual people. Moreover, students get  practical experience while doing part-time jobs. In other words, the pupil learns about maintaining financial condition, enhances knowledge about businesses as well as finds their choice for further study. For example, the admission department from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the students who get  admission after a gap,  results are exceptional compared to other pupils.

There is a lot of disadvantage also  ,  some students do not return back to their course . For example , they are doing a job or job they like  as it's earning  good and the work is good , they do not like to come back because they are happy with it . In addition , although they lose the chance to be experts in that field , however they do their studies then they have a degree and can make a career in a big company , now they can only do a task on a small scale .

"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.
Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.
","There is an increasing concern about the effects of globalization. Some believe that globalization surely benefits most countries in different aspects such as economics, education and politics; others, however, argue that it has negative consequences on national identities. In my view, globalization not only boosts economic development but generally has positive effects on national identities.
First, it is obvious that business contacts around the world contribute a lot to effective development. Entrepreneurs and business owners, from foreign countries, invest a substantial amount of money as well as technology into infrastructure and create many job opportunities for local residents, which consequently improve people's living standards. That is the reason why many countries make laws and policies to encourage international business and investment.
Moreover, with multicultural communication, national identities are more expressed to the outside world and get respected and appreciated by people from different cultures and social background. For example, water puppet has been introduced and been known in many countries recently. Therefore, Vietnamese identity has been enhanced and has impressed many people through this kind of performance which uniquely belongs to Vietnam.
Those who harbor the view that international collaboration between countries may threaten national identities may argue that youngsters start following western country trends without understanding their pros and cons. Millennials nowadays eat hamburgers, drink coffee, work in skyscrapers and even speak English often, fueling a lifestyle similar to that in New York. But I think that this just mirrors modern lifestyle and does not mean that we are losing our cultural heritage. To protect our national identities does mean that every Vietnamese people should drink tea every day and use chopsticks at every meal.
In sum, globalization do play an important role in a country's development. Meanwhile, a more prosperous economy facilitates the preservation and recognition of national cultures and identities worldwide.

There are people living in different countries who often asks themselves 'Why should we give decent part of our salary to the state?'. It could be no clear why taxes are existing but nevertheless they are important for the functioning of the whole nation of each particular country.
I think that taxes are a necessary part of our life and without them we could end up in a very bad situation.

Some may say 'If we had this money we would be better at managing them than the government!'
But I think it is not true for most of them. Quite a few people in the world have appropriate education for creating and managing long-term plans when we talk about money. Also, when we pay the tax we supporting not only our future, but also the life of the other people too.

In my opinion the main reason why we should pay taxes is a availability of public services. For example, public transport, education, medicine etc. All these things can't exist without taking part of a income people of the country. Of course to have all these things working properly government has to do its job at good level.

"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Giving opportunity to get free education and getting essential skills are very beneficial for Individuals, especially in terms of reducing poverty among population of any country. However, I think that it is not enough and government should also propose more working places for people.

On the one hand, getting free knowledge of how to read, write and calculate can boost someone's potential and person can find a work place and start earn a living. These skills are considered as a basis and people getting them while studying in school, so everyone shoul know them. Therefore, if everyone is acquainted with this knowledge it is hard to find a job. Job market is very competitive nowadays and usually the work place is given to a person who have had an experience in the industry or who have had a strong and very accurate knowledge which is required for a job. But what can person with only essential skills can do in this situation?

The expansion of job market comes into a field. If government gives more opportunities for people with only basic skills, it is much easier to reduce poverty in a country. For instance, developing and concentrating on specific area or a region with lack of work opportunities, government can increase work force of population. Moreover, there will be the fall of people who live under the line of poverty. Giving places to work that require less knowledge and no experience can boost economy of a region and everyone will have a beneficial impact.

To conclude, giving a free education that requires no fees can have a great influence on people, however government should also increase places for getting a job to decrease a level of poverty.",3,5.0

Many people discuss the positive and negative influence of newspaper. With providing knowledge and official information, I think the positive outweighs the negative.

In the one hand, many people said that newspapers negatively affect people and there are several reasons for this opinion. Firstly, many unethical newspapers post news which has wrong facts and information. For example, a story has many aspects to look at, but bad newspapers choose drama way to attract more readers. This makes people see a story in the wrong way and sometimes affects people who are in the story. Finally, newspapers can manipulate readers. For instance, newspapers can be used as a tool for government to manipulate society. This makes people do wrong things because their single source of truth provide manipulated information.

In the other hand, newspapers have many positive aspects such as providing knowledge and information to people and correct misunderstanding information. Firstly, we can not deny that newspapers provide a lot of information and knowledge. For example, newspapers update not only local news but also international one. People can gain knowledge and open their mind just by reading newspapers. Finally, newspapers help correct misunderstanding information. For instance, there is a lot of wrong information and newspapers have responsibility to provide official one. This helps people avoid misunderstanding information and have better point of view.

International cooperation plays a vital role in solving problems occurred in any country. In the modern era, the mentioned cooperation is promoted by unilateral agreements signed mostly between more than 150 countries. They are ratified by many states to cooperate in critical topics such as crime and punishment and protection of the environment. Take for instance, with the help of the unity between states, criminals transit to another country in order to escape from justice are caught without large operations and efforts. Therefore, it would be beneficial, especially in certain areas to cooperate internationally. 

Global cooperation also acts as a deterrent, in other words, some disputable and controversial issues before they become an actual dispute are covered in the agreements as well.

New generation young adults want to know their roots and backgrounds of their families through their house’s history. One of the ways is to interview elders such as their grandparents.

There are stories behind every houses, from the main entrance to the roof top balcony. If a house has been lived by more than 1 generation of a family, that place is full of histories to share.

It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement ? (approximately 250 words),"It is sometimes argued about the importance of the existence of public areas such as squares and parks in modern societies. While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.

On the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American culture’s trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Year’s Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  

On the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.

In conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",10,8.5

Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS label 8.",9,8.0
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent decades, housing scarcity in metropolitan areas has been receiving a great deal of public attention. While some assert that only government has the power to solve this problem, I disagree with this view and I believe that this issue should also be addressed by the private sector.
     On the one hand, The authority’s role in balancing demand and supply in housing is indisputable.First, since the politics has the ultimate right  in land management with the huge  resources from the national budget from tax collection, the state can build social housing at low prices coupled with the financial package for people with low income to afford their apartments with mortgage loans. Consequently, these actions are able to reduce the lack of housing in the metropolis. Second, local authorities could encourage companies to move their business to rural areas so that suburban dwellers would no longer have to commute to city centre to work, which in turn reduces urban population density.
     On the other hand, private real estate corporations are also a necessary driving force behind the supply of more housing.First, in order to decline  the lack of affordable housing, people may opt to live in other cities when the metropolis that they are working becomes crowded. For example, in recent years, a tremendously higher number of people from big cities such as Hanoi capital or Hochiminh city move to Danang city because they believe that they could get better chances to afford houses while still maintaining their living conditions. Second, if individuals only buy houses or lands for the purpose of living, asset bubbles would not happen and real estate companies would be forced to decrease property prices to survive in the market. This means that those cities would become more livable for everyone, not just the super-rich.
     In conclusion, the lack of housing is a complex problem which requires a combination of both the union and individuals  provide for the diverse needs of people. By making these solutions, housing problems in major cities will reduce considerably.",8,7.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding
out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own
knowledge or experience.","In some countries, there is a proliferation of people are gaining momentum in searching for the past story of the house or building they stay in. This essay will explain why and how people doing so.

To start with the first reason, people want to know about the quality and safety of their homes. For example: people will find details for the property quality, especially the construction builder, materials used to build the house and also the architecture structural in order to avoid deleterious consequences in the future such as building collapse. The second reason is to cast about the Chinese geomancy of the house location and direction. For instance, people want to live in a place that suits them and they believe that the house can give them a better fortune if it has a finer position. Last but not least, the third reason is knowing the legacy of the ownership status, so as to prevent the occurrence of unnecessary lawsuit problems.

Furthermore, there are ways that people are able to access the history of their living place. One of the common ways is browsing on the internet, this is a vital tool to explore all relevant information about the premise. Some people may be able to request from their local council or even ask the neighbours living in the neighbourhood.

To sum up, it is commonly believed that knowing the place you stay is much needed because I personally will be hunting what is the past history of my house and let myself living peacefully in my own shelter.",7,7.0
Some people believe that scientists have more influence over the world whereas others argue that politician have more influence over the world. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"The debate about whether scientists or politicians  have a greater global impact is a complex one. In my opinion, I believe that both of them have significant contributions to society which can make  people’s lives better.

In this world, scientists have an important role in driving innovation and progress. Their inventions can develop and improve many aspects such as technology, health, and agriculture. For example, the invention of computers and the internet have made significant changes in the way people communicate. Decades ago, in long-distance communication through the telephone, people could not show their faces, now they could show their faces in a high-quality video even in real-time. The invention makes people’s lives easier and may improve their living quality.

On the other hand, politicians have  considerable power in making decisions that affect the entire society. This condition indicates that they have direct responsibility for the fate of each individual. One of the most significant policies which can be decided by them is fuel prices and it has domino effects in many aspects. If the fuel prices are high then it will be followed by the increase in transportation fares, food, clothes, and other basic needs prices. So, they have to be very careful and thoughtful in order to make the policies.

In conclusion, both scientists and politicians play significant roles in society, they contribute in their own way. While scientists innovate and enhance the quality of life, it is politicians who determine the implementation and impact of these innovations through policy decisions.",8,7.5

"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is often argued that some countries invist in devolping highly specialised training centers to train its top athletes to achieve international sports, instead of facilitate and provide public training centers for everyone to use and to practice. In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.
Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self.",5,6.0
Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the last 2 decades, globally we have seen a rise in various car manufactures. Companies have been experimenting with their business model in order to cater to people from all walks of life and help fulfil the aspiration of owning a vehicle. The increase in car ownership has led to unseen environmental issues. Personally, I agree that the best way to solve environmental problems is by increasing the cost of fuel. In this essay, I will discuss my viewpoint. 

Owning a 4 wheeler as always been a symbol of wealth in society. There are plenty of schemes provided by the bank and other financial institutions who make it easier for one to be able to possess one. The auto industry is the single greatest engine of economic growth in the world.  In a country like India, the government depends on the automobile industry for its economic growth, thus leading poor regulations around auto ownership which has led to environmental destructions. The administration should enforce stringent laws so that people don't feel the urge of owning a car like for eg: increasing the cost of fuel which will restrict middle-class citizens to think through their decisions. Additionally, other measure can be that the taxes on autmobiles is increased. This will lead to individuals turning towards using public transport.

In conclusion, shared rides are an efificient method of communiting from one place to another, thus resulting in less cars which in return causes less traffic and saves the environment",4,5.5
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, many parents and teachers have found that more and more children are unable to concentrate on or focus on their studies in school. Some education experts believe that these children can face more lures in modern society such as electronic devices or gadgets, while some parents think that their sons and daughters may lose their concentration or attention because parents do not spend enough time  accompanying them. This essay will discuss the possible reasons and provide some solutions for dealing with these problems in the below paragraphs. 

On the one hand, it is generally accepted that modern society has more advanced technology and new inventions. That is to say, children who live in a modern environment may be hard to avoid using different electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones which can assist them to finish their school assignments with higher efficiency. However, these children may be addicted to electronic devices or spend too much time  surfing the internet if they do not receive enough relevant technological courses about managing their time to use the internet and electronic devices properly.

On the other hand, it can be claimed that parents have worked  more working hours in modern society. That is, the children can lose many opportunities to interact with their parents which can lead them to feel lonely and unsatisfied. Furthermore, it is believed that many parents feel exhausted after work, so they may not want to spend more time  communicating or interacting with their children. The only method that can avoid their children to bother them is to give their sons or daughters electronic devices to use, but this method may easily lead their children to become addicted to electronic devices without focusing on their studies in school.

In conclusion, it can be asserted that both parents and teachers need to arrange more extracurricular activities for their children or students to do because these activities can assist them to develop and cultivate their students' attention or concentration which can benefit them to study in school.",7,7.0
Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is an ongoing debate on whether scientific research should focus on solving global health problems, or spend the budget on other important issues. As I believe the ultimate goal of scientific research is to provide enhancements to human welfare, I think solving both world health and other issues are equally as important, and neither of which should be prioritized over the other.

On the one hand, solving world health problems is crucial to our existence as a species. In the past, there are many diseases that affects hundreds of millions of people, namely the plague or the smallpox, the latter of which has been entirely eradicated while very few people catch the plague nowadays, thanks to the extensive research into developing vaccines and preventative measures. Focusing on addressing global health issues can provide a boost to finding a cure many critical diseases, such as cancer, diabetes or malaria, which in turn can save countless lives. One prime case in point is the disease COVID-19 which has greatly disrupted everyone globally because of lockdowns, to  developing a vaccine two years later and everything is now back to normal.

On the other hand, putting an emphasis on solving world health issues can lead to neglection of other problems that are as equally as important. Regarding environmental problems, if these are not put into proper considerations, they can also pose a threat to our physical and mental well-being. If more scientific research are carried out to find solutions to pollution, global warming or loss of diversity, there could possibly be fewer people at risk of contracting diseases in the first place. Additionally, research into economic issues could help the impoverished have better shelters to stay in and enjoy a better life.

In conclusion, while health problems can pose a great threat to the human's health, other issues are not to be disregarded, as they too can greatly affect our daily lives. Governments should allocate budgets to prioritize carrying out research in an extensive field of research to ensure adequate treatment to all problems.",4,5.5
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","At the present time, a few people say that our population may have some challenges without rely  on each other, wherse other individuals believe that people are getting far self-ruling. In my opinion, living with people like a one body can be a good lifestyle for us to improve our civilization. 

For most, living independently is being a more preferable way of life. Although it create the some problems like not having an extra support from their close friends or relatives when he or she in a bad situation, they are finding some useful sides of being a self-governing humans until their current ages. For example,  numerous teenagers are doing the everything independently even the important descions without asking their parents about them. And, this can be a adequate development for those who are independently thinking about their important issues.

However, I believe that having an unity among people can be a beneficial to maintain the development of countries. If someone separated from a team, this person can do nothing, but with a team everything not seem impossible for this person because of lots of supports and arguments can make a good conclusion duration of working on a project. Thus, if we have a sense of unity among us, it may provide the some opportunities to work under lots supports in every matter. For instance, the Japanese people have some respect and always support, and most importantly they always understand when they need help to each other, therefore this country’s economic has developed as a result of having unity.

To conclude, although there are some advantages of being a independent person such as making descions independently, but I feel that having a warm relationship with every people makes the better environment and helps to improve the our economic.",4,5.5
Nowadays more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do the advantage of this trend outweigh the disadvantage?,"Having children tend to be less popular in our generation now, many people decide to have children later in their life, and many of them don't even want to have kids. There are some reasons behind it, and they will be explained in the following paragraphs.

First, the parenting costs are high. In the past, parents didn't have to spend too much time and pay too much attention to their children. However, due to the development of our society, parents want to give their kids the best life. Therefore, cultivating kids can be extremely expensive. Take China as an example. Chinese parents always pay considerably high parenting costs for kids' education, such as tutorials and home teachers. Hence, the parenting costs can be substantially high and exhausting because parents consistently need to keep an eye on their children. 

Second, the matured welfare system. In the past, especially during wartime, human resources were precious; therefore, the government encouraged its people to have more kids. On the contrary, human resources are not essential now, and we don't really need our offspring to take care of our elder lives; the government can serve us well. Besides, on account of our developed medical condition, we can live quite a long time; thus, the fertility rate is bound to decrease. 

Third, women's social status has been promoted. Modern women have a high level of education, they know the risk of having kids on their bodies and careers. Hence, they have the right to decide when they give birth. 

In conclusion, they are the three main reasons why more people decide to have children later in their life.",6,6.5
People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"It is widely believed that one solution to environmental problems would be for governments to hike up the price of petrol. While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue that other measures might have an even greater impact.
On the one hand, raising the cost of fuel for cars and other modes is one of the efficient way because of some reasons. Firstly, higher fuel prices can help to limit the number of car journeys. A large number of low and middle income earners are not able to afford the incease in the cost of petrol, therefore they are forced to adapt to other means of transport such as: bicycle, walking, train, bus, etc. Traveling by public transportation instead private cars is the necessary way to cut down on car emission and reduce greenhouse effect. Secondly, the extra money, which collected from increasing fuel prices can be used in order to compensate for the extra expense. Government can raise expenditure on upgrading and expand public facilities and transportation to suffice residents. 
On the other hand, while this rise in petrol costs might be a useful stopgap measure, national authorities could apply some other solutions to tackle this problem. The first measure is to invest money in developing eco-friendly means of transport. People should be encouraged to use electric cars and motorbikes to prevent air pollution. Moreover, introducing free bus and train passes, as the increased use of public transport would help in the effort to combat global warming. Another measure is to raise people awareness of the need to cut down on emissions from their cars. Environmental campaigns shoud be carried out more, especially on social media to popularize residents efficient ways to protect the environment. 
In conclusion, a sharp rise in petrol prices would be a useful environmental friendly transport measure, although in the longer term other steps would be more effective.",5,6.0
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Children are the future of nation.  They contributes in the economy  and represent their country worldwide but nowadays youth is lacking focus on their studies in institute. There are several causes of this like environment, technological gadgets and not participation in other activities.

The first reason that comes in my mind is their home environment. Sometimes pupils suffers from bad situations in their homes which ruins their concentration from studies. For example, when children see their parents suffering from poor financial condition or their mother has been suffered from domestic violence. The second reason is, children use mobiles, computers all the time which somehow impacts their health and mind. They get addiction of using these technical devices. Therefore, in schools students think about videos games and other stuff which they always see into these gadgets. The third reason is not getting  time to get engaged into hobbies and play with their friends. For instance, some guardians force their children to focus only on studies all the time either they are at home or school. This forceful condition automatically moves them away from studies as they always try to find some way to do other activities like play.

There are numerous ways that can solve this problem and helps to increase their concentration on studies. As an example enough time has been provided by their guardians to get involve in games and sports. In this way they will feel fresh as well as  their brain will get active and they becomes happy which will directly increase their interest in studies. Moving further, parents should give them limited access of using mobiles and tablets because overuse of these devices has a bad effect on their wellness. In schools, extra activities and task should be provided by their mentors. So that they can participate in sports and other volunteer activities which help them in many ways.

In conclusion, parents, family and teachers all should take care of the mental state of children  that how they are behaving and why they are lacking concentration from their studies because there is a possibility of any reason behind that they are not doing well in studies in schools and classroom.",4,5.5
"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.
Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","There are approximately 196 countries in the world, each following their own business strategies and a unique culture. It is the duty of everyone to appreciate and respect their cultural diversity in order to maintain peace and harmony across the globe. Increasing trade and cultural exchange between countries has both advantages and disadvantages. Let me discuss both aspects and conclude with my personal opinion.

To embark with the advantages, trade connection between the two nations promote a smooth and friendly relation among them. It assists in setting up a mutual collaboration and foreign investment in our province, thereby increasing the job opportunity for the graduated youngsters. The country's economic status is greatly improved through these marketing relations and is one of the better ideas in assisting a nation's progress in development. Also, by allowing cultural contact, their diversity can be familiarized worldwide, where everyone can know about the different traditions followed across the globe.

To view the negative aspects, a country's identity starts to fade through these type of commerce as the other nation might dominate us. For example, the business collaboration between India and China has resulted in loss of former country's identity, wherein most of the population prefers to buy the products made in China. This has greatly resulted in depreciation in value for the native products due to the preference given to foreign articles. Also, there are high chances of some particular culture or tradition getting extinct due to their over  diversification.

By summarizing the above said points, the advantages overweigh the disadvantages of such business and cultural relations. So I deeply agree that developing trade collaboration can greatly influence the nation's economic level in a positive way other than improving cultural diversity across the globe.",7,7.0
"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Some people claim that contemporary music has issues on the youth generation whereas others think the opposite and defend the benefits of  to listen music. This essay will discuss both sides of this situation and explain the reasons why music has more pros than cons for  teenagers.

Listening music is good for all ages because it can change our mood quick and bring different emotions. The youth people have been overstimulated for many devices and they have had some issues with tasks that required concentration. Lo-fi beats, for example, can regulate the heartbeats and breathing in a way that helps to keep focus on one task for many hours. Therefore, this type of music could be very helpful nowadays with attention disorders, which becomes more and more common among teens. Another beneficial example in the kids is the lyrics because it is a kind of poem with a message behind. For many years, music teaches through its stories about culture, experiences and impressions of the world. Therefore style, lyrics and rhythm are always changing to adapt to the new generation of listeners or keeping memory alive.

On the other hand, it is not all songs that we can consider beneficial for youngs. In this phase of life, they are still figuring out their characters and personalities and some noise as referred to as music, could not be good for them. For example,  Brazilian funk is very popular among young and teens, however, the lyrics are always incentivizing to commit crimes, rape women and consume drugs. Therefore, if I had a teen close to me, I would never allow him to listen those kinds of music.

In my opinion, music is extremely good and could help in different moments in life, especially for our kids; but requires the attention of the parents to overseas what type of music their children are listening to.

To conclude, music has by far and large more benefits than problems to influence young people because it can change emotions or tell experiences, even though some type of music could have a negative impact.",4,5.5
"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believe by some cultures that younger family members should be responsible for elders in the family by law once they no loger have enough strength to look after themselves in both physically and mentally ways. This has become a controversial issue. From my point of view, I am disagreed with this idea and reckon it should not be made legal. The reasons for my argument will be explained further in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached.

Some segments of society are thinking that it is a neccessary job for descendants to take care of the elderly when they become physically and mentally weak. However, I strongly disagree with this, not with the fact that pupils taking care of elders but with the belief that it should be made legal. I always think that it is a good deed for youth to look after their family members, but this should be an optional choice. Everyone have their own rights to choose on whether they want or do not want to do something. Furthermore, it is found by one of the surveys that some people, including young ages, are not ready to hold others' lives in hands because they are still struggling with their own lives. To illustrate this, think about a person who work all day and night but still surrounded by problems such as financial, working, and educational issues. Therefore, it would be best for these people to look after their family members when they are ready or it would gives them more burden.

In conlusion, even though some populations believe that the younger members of the family should be legally responsible for the elderly, I disagree with this and think that everyone must have their rights to choose. Hence, it should not be made as a legal law but should be an optional choice. The offsprings must look after others when they think they are ready and do not have any other burden.",1,4.0
"Some people think the news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Most people admit this century is the intelligence, technological era. Some people believe read the news in the newspapers and watch television news programs are wasting time. I partly agree this statement due to several reasons which will be mentioned in this essay. 
To begin with, reading or watching the news is beneficial and essential factors in our soul.  People who also knows the news, they are able to easily understand the world especially, politics. Currently, overriding news is global pandemic CoVID-19. Every day, even every hour was updated this news. This intelligence is fascinating to everyone. Cause of everyone wants to know how it is increasing onward and how to beware of this virus. Another benefit of TV, on this condition, namely in     quarantine pupils are studying via TV or Internet. Because everyone is staying home, no one can go out without permission. In addition, reading, a wide range of news categories such as politics, economy, and entertainment will broaden your spectrum of knowledge. If you are specialized in any fields like medicine or science, medical and scientific news will intensify your knowledge accumulation. 
On the other hand, read or watch too much news, it is really wasting time and  it will be detrimental. The cause of it is reading or watching much out of the norm, it will face clue flow. As a result, these things will distribute of our personal activity. Hence, there are some explanations for why people refuse to obtain the news. The most popular one is that the data from the news does not directly connect with their lives. It is obvious that we cannot recognize any relationship between a worker's heart and a report about the status of the war in the Middle East or the change political system of a country in the all the side of the world. However, I believe that it is just a lack of the perspective of how crucial knowledge could be in one's growth.  
In conclusion, I strongly believe that, read the news in the newspaper 	
And watch television news programs have several advantages, while some people claim that is wasting time. 
I would strongly recommend people read newspapers every day to keep up with the progress of social development",6,6.5
"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of  artists including painters, musicians and poets, etc. However, other people think  that is a waste of money.","Many people’s lives are richer because of art – music, paintings, calligraphy, pictures,  sculpture, poems and dance. There are some who claim that it is important to support  the artists, and others who are opposed to government funding. In the following  paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument and finally give my opinion.  There are many reasons why government should fund artists. The contributions of  artists to the society are very essential. Art can bring out people’s creativity, views and  personalities. For example, we learn about our history, traditions and culture through  movies, songs and paintings made by artists. Artists are the media of diffusing  tradition. All kinds of tradition are the basis of a country without which the country  can’t be civilised. So artists are the ambassadors of culture and play a vital role in  elevating the level of civilization of the country. It is a major form of cultural  abundance.  Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of communication.  Our language is a result of people’s need to communicate. Art is what differentiates us  from animals. Art is our soul and it is a source of courage. Artists also entertain us.  Finally, government should fund artists because earning a livelihood from art is  difficult especially in the budding stages.  Opponents of government funding on artists say that money spent on the arts could  have been used for considerably more vital purposes. They have strong reasons as a  nation’s health and wellbeing should be paramount. The idea that elderly people are  forced to wait for essential operations whilst the money required to increase available  medical provision is spent on opera and ballet is plainly immoral. There are also more  deserving social causes for the money that should be considered before the arts.  Homelessness, unemployment, illiteracy – all of these deserve to be addressed before  money is spent on what is essentially little more than entertainment.  To summarise, I would like to say that as both sides have strong arguments, it depends  on the condition of the country. In developed countries where even the poorest of the  poor have all the basic amenities of life, government should spend on art and artists  but in countries where people are dying of starvation and diseases, other matters  should be given priority.",1,4.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students 
are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it 
will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give 
your own opinion","The quality of education is very essential in our society, in order to create leaders with bright a future.  However,  the government and many organisations become more concerned about how to improve the educational sector. Many suggested that the best way to do this,  is to seek the opinion of the students  as well as accepting criticism against their tutors, others disagree with this suggestion.  In this essay, I will discuss both views, and give my opinion. 

First of all, seeking the opinion of the students is indeed a better way to increase the quality of education, this will enable the governments and other bodies to identify any difficulties the students are facing and to be able to make any necessary adjustments. For example, I taught a group of students few years ago, and discovered only a few of the children were able to understand, but when I seek their opinion on how to make them understand better,  I was able to assist these children in a better way.  Therefore, these students encounter different challenges every day, but asking for their opinion will help tutors to understand how to impart knowledge in each student. 

On the other hand, the students may take for granted when asked to give reasons for their difficulties. They might use that freedom of speech to blame teachers whom they dislike, and to accuse tutors that have their interest at heart, this in turn could lead to hatred between the tutors and the learners. For example, in Nigeria some group of students gang beats a teacher who flogged them in the classroom for not reading their books. If such ones were asked to give an opinion on bow to increase the quality of education, they will obviously blame such teacher.

To conclude,  seeking the opinion of the learners  has its advantages and disadvantages, however,  the advantages outweigh the disadvantages considering students who are really  willing to learn.",8,7.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To What extent do you agree or disagree?","Famous personalities such as film stars always look for their beauty and richness rather than their accomplishments. As many youths follow them, it is setting up a wrong direction for  society. I strongly agree with this and discuss in this essay  the supportive points.

To begin with, as the current world revolves around beauty, Most of the renowned personalities only take care of their glamour and wealth ignoring their actual success is and unfortunately, they are the youth icons and trendsetters.It is not a good sign for society.In other words,young teenagers follow the same lifestyle as their loved cinema hero or heroine.For example, if a movie is block bluster then people from different places will be travelling to the city where the hero stays just to see him and for a selfie by spending a lot of money.

To add more,the followers of the iconic persons also try to maintain the same way.if any movie artist buys clothes in a well-known shop which are very expensive for common youngsters but still teenagers are buying apparels from the same shop or the same brand though they can not afford.Moreover, if they do not get money from their parents then they argue for nothing and that is also lead to depression in college-going students which is a kind of negative impact on the community.

In conclusion,Celebrities should also think of their success and how they can support their followers for good things rather than only look after their beauty and richness, then the impact on the society is none or minimal.",10,8.5
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain
people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. 
Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","It is true that museums have multi-functions, while some people hold the idea that these places should be enjoyable and others think they need to spread knowledge. Personally, I agree with the point that a museum is a container that collects advanced technologies and knowledge, allowing people to learn a lot.

There are some reasons why some people think that museums ought to provide joy and happiness. Firstly, the primary reason is that museums are public places and aim to attract visitors. This means that these places need to provide tourists with stunning goods and impressive things instead of education. In other words, people are less likely to visit a museum with the purpose of learning something. Secondly, the average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more  emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. 

On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum's exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.

In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.",6,6.5
"Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than negative ones, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","it is often argued that children in the contemporary era are more responsible, whereas, others opine that young people are more attentive in old days. In my opinion, it has a positive impact on offsprings as they have more responsibilities that make them  amenable towards society.

On the one hand, there is a number of reason behind less growth of  responsibilities. Firstly, in this technical era, kids have alternative equipment so they spend most of their with gadgets and scrolling social media applications such as, Facebook, Instagram which urge them to check their cell phones frequently. A consequence this,  leads to a lack of helping others. Moving further, due to the hectic schedule of work, parents do not have enough time to spend with their kids and make them understand  the moral values that will help them. For instance, a report issued by the ministry of the USA, 76% guardian of youngsters  sent their toddlers to creche due to time shortage, as a result of this,A a child aged between 8 to 12 years are less attentive in their work.  

On the other hand, toddlers have become smart, intelligent as well as accountable . They are very focused in their field of education as the study system in this advanced era is highly competitive and adolescents facing difficulty to score better marks. Moreover, juvenile respect their elders and they start earning at a very young age and learn social skills which are fruitful to them and for society as well. To illustrate, pubescent who earn money with part-time job or any other way can meet their need and expenses which eliminate the burden of parents along with, they become self-dependent and take the decision of their life.

To conclude, with the changing atmosphere and advancement in technology have a great impact on kids as compared to past days.",7,7.0
"Some people think the the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, instead of benefiting them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There are a lot of 

People define school as a place to have an opportunity to grow up as decent individuals whereas some people assert the origin of establishing schools is giving people basic education and socialization for settling down as members of society. The main goal of schools is to consider a process of learning to conduct helpful roles in society, not personal ones. 

However, there are several reasons why many people say schools are no longer places where children can only focus on cooperation and learning to be good citizens and workers for society. First, 

the modern world wants an individual who has unique skills and outstanding abilities than the others, which leads to massive competition. Following these changes, the role of 

schools has to accept their different purposes to benefit individuals' growth. 

Nevertheless

, it is still significant that school teaches children to be helpful to society. Even though the pattern of life in the modern world focuses on individual quality, the individual will eventually work for a part of society. For example, the more school change their curriculum to spend more time on personal studies, instead of learning subjects to enhance morality, the more children tend to act rude and uncourteous in society. As a result, they will fail to adapt to society because they lack the skills to live together with people as a member of society, even if their capabilities to conduct work are decent. Alternatively, there are a lot of private academies to enhance individual capabilities, thus it would be better to let the school conduct its role as educating children into good citizens and workers and invest extra time for individual growth out of school.  

In conclusion, building an individual's ability to survive in 

this modern world is important. However, it does not mean the role of the school is supposed to be changed into benefiting individuals since there is more valuable learning from school curriculums.",1,4.0
Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"in today's modern world, advancement in technology development has provided many ways to marketers of promoting their products and services to the general public. For example, Tv ads, and online ads on video streaming websites, these ads are clutter everywhere which ultimately leads to a negative impact on behaviour and our mindset.

To begin with, the advertiser usually promotes consumerism, which anchors on buying frequently. we are always told to buy new clothes, and stay trendy, or we won't look cool without buying the latest iPhone. These advertisements create a habit that negatively affects individual financial status. moreover, They use stereotypes, Through advertising, they create a feeling toward how a certain group of people should look like. For example, beauty creams tailored towards women, try to project the white colour of a woman as superior to the other colour, and women must accept this projection that the media portrays and consider this as having higher status. 

Additionally, mind cluttering everywhere you see you may find an advertisement. In current times people desire to make their life as simple as possible, but due to this factor, we have to process thousands of information daily. Furthermore, misleading, companies often make products look amazing through their advertising design and stories. But in reality, it doesn't perform as described in the ads. Additionally, adverts generally create low self-esteem by manipulating thoughts and by persuading you to buy products that will make you happy.

To conclude, in my opinion, advertising negatively impact our mental health and sometimes gives us a financial dent. As most people are blindly following the trends without thinking about their consequences",1,4.0
"Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that video games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people hold the belief that video games are actually good or even as useful educational tool while some see video games in a negative way. I completely agree that video games are harmless if you use it in a right way and right time.

Firstly, dealing with the issues that some people likely to be addicted to games especially in a specific: video games. To male, the way to escape from reality is playing video games with “the boys”, its help them to release stress and to keep them entertaining. Besides that, you can make money out of that, sitting in front of the table with the micro and streaming yourself with funny reaction. Another point to consider is the benefits of video games are to keep up your entertainment, can make money out of it or in a different way is it can be useful educational tool. For example, “Typer Shark” is the name of a video game that my school apply in their program system is to improve students typing skill in an easy way. The format is good because it is a “video games” and it is challenging the student to type more faster, if not you will lose.

I believe that video games is good for your mental health in a mentally way. But you should use your time and energy wisely and in a positive way.",3,5.0
Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"No one will argue that in this time the use of social media is at its peak. The impact of the digital world on people is enormous. It has changed the way individuals communicate with each other and stay informed about the world around them. Even if social media provides abundant of advantages in the way how the news spreads with high speed and allows people to communicate with each other easily, it also has some disadvantages. This essay will explore if the benefits of using social networks outweigh the drawbacks.

The first major advantage to notice is the speed at which news is published. Nowadays people can easily read all the news with the details at once on a good deal of apps and websites. This was, however, not possible before and they were forced to wait for several days. The next benefit is the opportunity to connect people from different parts of the world. A majority of social media platforms offer its users opportunities to share life updates, make video calls or text messages to their friends or colleagues, which creates a sense of togetherness. These functions are extremely useful especially now as people are more like to relocate to other countries and cities for studying or working purposes.

On the other hand, it is necessary to compare the advantages with the drawbacks as well. Firstly, social networks may pose a danger to individuals’ privacy. There are ample of different persons on social media platforms and not all of them have decent ideas and intentions when using the platforms. Therefore, it is important to protect all user accounts to avoid getting into trouble such as spreading private information about oneself and stalking. One more disadvantage to mention is misinformation. Because of the speed at which news lay out there may be misleading content. This may cause problems from the public’s point of view as wrong information can lead to heaps of trouble.

In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of using social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news are closely connected with each other. The benefits of connectivity opportunities and access to news are amazing, but they may cost people their privacy breaches and misinformation. Impending improvements in social media could bring balance to it.",6,6.5
More and more people are becoming serious overweight. Some people think that a solution can be to increase the price of fattening food. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The issue of obesity had been in existence for many a couple of decades around the world. For those who are interested it is possible to surf the Internet or read articles discussing overweight. There are several points of view in this matter. The first claim that the a lot of people suffer from overweight. An alternative belief regards that this is harmful and considers that the government should soar a price to junk food as the most important in that case essay. This essay allows me elaborate about this issue and also make a conclusion.

On the one hand, numerous researchers are showing that in recent years there have been some changes in obesity patterns. As a result, this trend is becoming more and more popular. It does not matter whether one likes it or not, the fact has to be recognized that  between 2016 to 2017 the number of individuals who suffer from fatness uplifted dramatically from 1000 people to 3200 people in London. To exemplify, the government of London decide to increase price to fast food. Thus, nobody can deny that it is really difficult to get rid of this compelety or even avoid it.

However, this attitude may cause a certain degree among professionals that ordinary people with roundness must change their lifestyle. For instance, they should do some exercise and play active games. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take into account all the circumstances of each individual case. 

From my point of view, the previous opinion definitely makes sense, as it comes from my own experience. In general, it should not be forgotten that the attitude the this question always depends on the way of life of a concrete person and his personal origin.",7,7.0
"In some countries ,more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this ? How can people research this ?","It is often said that in modern countries, people who live in antique houses want to know about their former inhabitants.  There are multiple reasons for it and the aim of this essay is to understand this interest and how the public can gather information about the ones that lived before in their homes.

Firstly, nowadays most old buildings are being demolished to give way to neighbourhoods formed by same-looking concrete cubes. The ones who live in a house instead of a flat feel special and, of course, are intrigued by those who walked the same corridors as them or slept under the same ceiling years ago. Furthermore, they feel that this local culture should be preserved, as well as they hope they will be remembered as well by those who will live there in the future. That is a basic human emotion and this trend can not be denied.

Secondly, local authorities and organizations are also enrolled on this task and can provide valuable resources for discovering the details of almost any building. For instance, councils keep records of addresses and taxpayers that can be very useful in knowing who was there during the last decades. Additionally, architectural societies have photographic testimonials about how the city developed through the ages. Thus, that is an easy way of discovering the names of the particulars who lived there. Finally, a little talk with the elder neighbours of the area can be a very nice and interesting manner of getting information about the whereabouts and stories of the past inhabitants of any site. This last one is the procedure I prefer most.",6,6.5
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots, what is your opinion?","It is believed that artificially intelligent robots will eventually replace the entire workforce. While it is possible for mundane work to be carried out by robots, I believe certain jobs requiring human touch will still be performed by people. This essay will discuss some of the tasks that will and will not be taken over by automation.

Due to robots' precision ability, they have the capacity to carry out unskilled work. In production, the use of machines has helped companies to cut costs, save time and increase profitability across many industries. For instance, in the electronic industry, microchips are pre-dominantly assembled by machines for many years and can hardly be seen involving human labour. This is because the line of work usually involves a high level of precision and speed which people may not be able to keep up with. Furthermore, some other industries that automation can potentially take over include the military, as well as food and beverages.

Although machines are programmed to be highly intelligent, certain tasks requiring human skills, such as mental intelligence and human interaction cannot be performed by them. For example, doctors and surgeons are positions that can only be carried by highly-trained individuals. While machines can be precise in how they operate, they are unable to interact with patients or account for the patients' feedback during a doctor's appointment session. As a result, misdiagnosis can happen and is detrimental to the patients. 

In conclusion, even though the use of robots will increase significantly to increase productivity in the future, human intervention in certain areas is still essential to ensure adequate human interaction. In consequence, certain jobs will still be dominated by people.",11,9.0
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The aim for every business is to gain profit as much as they can. Some people claim that businesses need to contribute to the well-being of the society. In my point of view, it is required for every company to have a corporate social responsibilities program because of some reasons mentioned below.

Firstly, without employees no business can be run, which means employees are one of the most important resources of a company. So every company should care about their employees who support the success of their business. For example, a paint manufacturing company should provide a medical check up program to its employees yearly since some chemicals can be harmful to humans. Secondly, companies should have a CSR program for the environment since there might be impacts on the environment because of their business, for example, pollution can be caused because of the waste from factories since some companies throw thrashes to the river and gas produced from some industries can lead to air pollution. 

Moreover, companies should take part in community programs since the community also has to suffer from the side effects made by business. For example, if there was air pollution in the town because of factories, people living in that town had to suffer from the pollution as well. Thus, businesses should have social responsibilities for the society, for example, put some proportion of profit to local charities. If they contribute to the well-being of its employees, the environment and the society, their image will be enhanced and they can get awareness from the public. It is a win-win situation for a company.

To conclude, even though making profit is the main purpose for every company, they should take social responsibilities and contribute to the well-being of people and things related to their business so that they can get recognition from the public which is valuable to the image of the company.",5,6.0
Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligence Roberts.What is your opinion?,"Artificially intelligent robots will take over the human workforce in the future. Although, all the easy skill jobs will be done by robots, but still some skillfull work will require human contacts. This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be undertaken manually. 

Robots may be replaced to carry forward the jobs that are not too complex and can easily perform without much involvement by humans.As it will be beneficial for multinational companies and industries to gain profits through artificial intellect instead of spending highly on hiring, training and employing the human. For instance, in may metropolitan cities the traffic personnel are replaced by an automatic traffic control system which is far more cost effective. In addition, this system works around the clock and require no holiday.

For these reasons computers and robots will be involved in human lives more frequently in the upcoming future.

Conversely, there are some skillfull jobs that are interdependent on human relations and emotions, and that this job cannot be handled by automated robots. Likewise, the jobs where the human mind, soul and his own natural brilliance is more crucial rather than only the profit conquered by the artificial brilliance. These jobs include psychology, education, medicines and some social jobs needed for the betterment of the society. All in all, robots cannot perceive human nature that has performed this social evolution since hundred and thousands of years ago. 

To sum up, a significant number of jobs will be control of the artificial intellect in the future. Despite the fact that advanced technologies will take over the market; however I still believe that some sophisticated jobs will require human agility. Ultimately, skillfull jobs that require people excellence cannot be effectively carried out by artificial intelligence.",10,8.5
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is wasting time for receiving news whether reading a newspaper or watching TV programmes, so there are those who claim that news unlinks peoples’ lives. From my perspective, I completely disagree with this viewpoint. The supporting reasons will be discussed throughout the essay.

There are some justifications about why people's lives have a relationship with the news. The first and possibly the most obvious reason is that people might have the readiness for preparing themselves, they might not awareness and accept those situations. Due to the fact that numerous people have their businesses, they exactly need to cope with problems, particularly fluctuated economy or inflation. This action impacts on the supporting citations. A clear illustration of this is the latest new which is COVID-19, this affects various things, whether tourist attraction or share, resulting in adversely affected  investors.

Another important point to consider is generally knowledges, citizen possibly feels like the approach the oversea. Some group of viewers lacks opportunity to travelling other countries, so the TV news programmes are the way can illustrate the visualization. Numerous viewers might educate their cultural tradition throughout the screen similar reality. Additionally, most news mostly provides the foreigner news which have subtitles or translate for people who do not capable for foreigner languages. For instance, ASEAN organization or trade war that people are able to keep informed. This action lead, to teach children become  being modernized.

In conclusion, even though the receiving news has without connection, it brings about various benefits. It is not easy to arrange information, so the reporter is the animal behaviour to explain such as outer or inter news. Personally, I recommend that receiving pieces of information by any way that people can suddenly know it, there is not thought to lose.",0,<4
"Many jobs used to be done at home by hand, but nowadays an increasing number of them are done using machines instead. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of 
this development.","In this modern world of advanced technology, people were more relying on home appliances for daily household activities as in the past they do all of it by themselves. 

The invention of advanced electronic machines is helping people to save time, which they invest in doing regular housekeeping activities.

For instance, washing machines help people to save  their precious time and energy which they spent on washing clothes by hand in the past. Moreover, it helps parents to save time, which they can enjoy with their children.

However, there are few cons associated with use of machines such as health problems.

There was a survey conducted by local newspaper which revealed that people who do not use home appliances were more healthy than people who were in the habit of using them. If we talk about microwaves, it got banned from Japan because use of it was leading to serious health problems like cancer, hypertension. 

According to me we should only use these appliances when required so that we can maintain a healthy lifestyle.",1,4.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Few individuals are of the opinion that the best way to be successful in one's field of work is by attending a high school or a higher institution, while the rest are of the idea that getting a job immediately after school is preferable. I believe that it is necessary to go through college as well as obtain a university education for the purpose of acquiring work in a certain field, while primary education can be enough to kick-start one's career where little or no educational background is required.

Firstly, in occupations and job positions where high academic skills and knowledge are a requirement, attending a college or university is a necessity. For example in a construction company like Civmec in Western Australia, where the position of a civil engineer is advertised, preference will be given to candidates with Civil engineering university certificates, skills and knowledge rather than someone who has no training in that field. This is because it is believed that the preferred person would have undergone several practicals and tutoring pertaining to the work he or she is applying for.

Whereas, someone who has a prospect of seeking a job as an attendant in a grocery store or restaurant, will only need little or no academic knowledge. Therefore a person who has only attended a primary school has a great opportunity in this instance and may as well flourish in this career of choice, which will only require experience on the actual job. Most of this kind of work put workers through training and orientation regardless of their prior skills and knowledge.

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that people can be successful in their careers whether they study at university, college or just elementary school. It will only depend on the type of occupation or job the person is taking up.",7,7.0
"Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent  robots?

What is your opinion?","Artificially intelligent robots are progressing continuously and replacing humans in jobs. In my opinion, while there are jobs that will be taken over by robots, there are still many jobs that can’t be replaced. This essay will discuss, why not all tasks can be done by robots.
 It is a fact that robots are able to do many tasks that humans can more efficiently, which is why many jobs is being replaced by them. Because of how efficient robots are in doing jobs, many companies are choosing to turn to them rather than employing workers. Other than this reasoning, robots are more cost-effective than humans are. For example, factories which are using robots to manufacture products make more profits than factories that don’t. For these reasons, many jobs are increasingly getting replaced.
Although many jobs have been replaced by machines, not all jobs can be replaced. One reason is that the machines still need to be supervised. For instance, machines can malfunction and it is the job of humans to fix the issue. In addition, some machines need to be watched in case of an accident and to adjust. Another reason is jobs that require human relations, contact and emotions can only be done by humans. As a result, robots will never be able to replace all jobs.
In conclusion, even if many jobs get replaced by robots, jobs that required human specific skills will always exist. Ultimately, there will still be jobs that only humans can do which robots can’t.",9,8.0
In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
To begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
Furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
Although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects.",5,6.0
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Nowadays, a healthy lifestyle is getting progressively popular among all people around the globe. Personally, from my point of view, it is a great course and as we see now, a lot of modern citizens want to follow this image. Overall, they are even under psychological presser, because they have got many advertisings and as mass media information. Additionally, in terms of involving new individuals, this strategy has to be prolonged, plus it would be very efficient to include special sport and educational programmes into a free package which will be accessible for all citizens. Moreover, provide an affordable cost of healthy food in order to ensure that they have an equal price with fast food and other insalubrious products.

Considering the main reasons, we can notice that plenty of individuals just want to be fancy, sporty and keep up with the times. For instance, in Russia, especially in Moscow there is one very famous and modern grocery network which provide high-quality products, it also has a very nice design and many bonus programmes. Consequently, the majority of neighbours prefer to buy everything there and in connection with this have become involved in this image of life. Furthermore, the Internet and especially social networks are full of photos whit sporty and young strangers, which can motivate other people to follow their image.  

Overall, modern society has got many motivating features and mostly they are successfully working. However, it would be helpful to afford them more opportunities and engage new participates. For instance, in several regions of the United Kingdome, there was a special educational programme, whose propose was organizing personal consultations and monitoring the statistics. Finally, it was a very useful idea, because they had got many positive results with improvements in the health condition of these citizens.   

In conclusion, I would like to stress, that since many individuals have found out this style as a fashionable and modern, they want to be a part of this movement. However, in many countries, it is still very expensive and not available to all citizens. Looking towards the future, it is no doubt a given that in alignment with the current course the modern society on a good way and we should continue together and will help other individuals have become a part of it.",8,7.5
"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent years, teamwork plays a vital role in schools and organisations. Researchers argue the fact that students should learn about collaboration by playing games in schools. I partially agree with the statement, and I will provide the substantiated arguments in the upcoming paragraphs.

To commence, physical activities done in the group brings team spirit. To put it another way, teachers should encourage the pupils in making teams in performing sports activities as it builds the confidence of students. Moreover, playing together would reduce conflicts and helps in spreading love and harmony in society. As an illustration, games such as football and hockey are often played in groups. Such games help in bringing peace to society. In fact, games unite the different religions and bring happiness to the communities.  Furthermore, strength and endurance help in uplifting the group.

On the contrary, schools should make academic groups and perform other cultural activities to bring collaboration in society. In other words, teachers should give team assignments such as group presentations to encourage pupils in cooperating. Indeed, such activities would be helpful for children who lack interest in sports activities. Also, such projects would foster the learning process using practical knowledge. In addition, schools should organize cultural programs. For instance, group dance, bhangra and would encourage the students to work in groups. Therefore, it would integrate different cultures.

To conclude, although sports activities help in cooperating, teachers should focus on other academic group projects to unite students in the schools. Therefore, such initiatives would bring harmony between the people.",6,6.5
Many people think that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There are many people who believe that taking interviews is not the finest way to assess the appropriate candidate for any job. There are other ways that determine the quality of a candidate for that role. This essay will discuss why interviews are significant for many professional jobs.

Firstly,  In every country the first process of ,hiring is taking an interview of professionals for job positions in every organisation such as private or industrial. In my private ,firms interviewers check the candidate's communication and knowledge through interviews so they can hire that person on basis of his skills. Moreover, this is the best medium to know about the person's ability for a position that an organisation gives him for his knowledge. Therefore, the suitability of a candidate depends on their knowledge or communication skills.

On the other hand, most labour jobs do not require an interview because these jobs are based on daily wages so it's difficult to interview them on a dailly basis. There is no doubt that interview is one of the significant processes to hire a great Scientist , Programmer or Doctor but in a labour ,market it's not necessary to interview them.

To conclude, the vast majority of professional jobs required a complete process to hire a multi talent skilled person , so there is a much need for interviews for these positions without that no one can get skills knowledge about these candidates.",2,4.5
Some people believe that what children watch on television influences their behaviour. Others say that amount of time spent watching television influences their behavior. Discuss both views and give own opinion.,"In This day and age, technology has brought significant change in humanity's lives.Few Masses think that children's attitude is changed by box broadcasted.Another segment society says that spending excessive turn is responsible for altering children's behaviour. So I intend to explore that influence of both statements along with my point of view.
To regard with one school thought that.Firstly,it is true that audio is broadcasted many things which are, some reliable and some are unnecessary as well as it has negative and positive outcomes.So, therefore, youth always does limitation of actions which are telecasted on television, even these scenes are related to hand washing steps, good diet although its about dangerous stunt, luxurious life and so on. As a result, through this practice, children can make their future better or ruin.
Moving further with another segment believes that the past plays crucial role in everyone's life so people should use it wisely.Thus, if teenager spent a lot of points in front of the station, they may become irritable and disturbed.Which act as a rude or misbehaviour with their elder ones.As a ramification, they cannot make a strong relationship with their family members. Moreover, they can distract from study due to spending too much moment while watching video instead of pay attention to the study. As a consequence, they cannot obtain high grades in final exams which put negative impacts in order to cannot find good jobs.
In conclusion, I restate that station gives many more valuable things with few unessential actions. Therefore, parents should keep eyes on their children's activities by this they may adopt very good habits.",5,6.0
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Museums have had been playing a significant role to magnify the glory of a nation along with serving educational purposes. A segment of society opines that the sole aim of museums is to entertain folks; diametrically opposed to this, others believe that these places are more useful in imparting invaluable cultural value to the young generation. Both statements may advance equally compelling arguments, but I inclined the second notion for the reasons which are explained in the following paragraphs.

First and foremost, museums are the buildings that hold  invaluable information regarding the ancient era of human civilisation. How the human species have had been evolved from the first phase of the life cycle is clearly depicted in this architecture with pictures. For instance, the national museum Delhi has diverse articles from the magnificent ancient era including the statues of the kings of that period and their accessories like jewellery and clothes. Thereby, apparent visuals of these articles longer last than reading; these structures are the source of knowledge for those who are keen on exploring history.

Moving further, thanks to globalisation, it is easy to travel and investigate  other countries around the globe. The popularity of these monuments attract  tourists, therefore it would be cooler if these buildings have  modern amenities like air-conditioned halls and better visibility of the accessories, safe security system where children can roam and enjoy themselves to the fullest with their parents.

To conclude then, whilst there exist contrasting stances on the matter, it is taxing work to decide which one have a more positive outcome, howbeit, undoubtedly, museums are the prime source of ancient cultures and can upgrade the youngsters with the history, but it would be impeccable if these buildings have offered some entertainment along with a safe environment to the sightseers.",8,7.5
"As well as making money, businesses also have social respinsibilities, to what extent do you agree or disagree.","Businesses are always driven by money-making pursuits, which, however, is argued that it needs to shoulder social responsibilities as well. From my perspective, I am in favour of this opinion, believing that not only should enterprises and entrepreneurs aim to make a profit but take more duties into consideration.

Living in a world full of competitiveness and stress, there is no doubt that businessmen and corporations make an effort to earn as much money as they could, thus gaining an edge over competitors. For instance, Apple's company endeavours to lower the manufacturing cost and increase the sale price so that it can reap more revenue from the market. As a result, all interested parties, such as shareholders, governments and so on, can benefit from it. Furthermore, profit-driven pursuits could fuel people and enterprises to make progress through unremitting effort, because wealth is able to make many dreams come true. For example, business persons can improve the living standard for themselves and their families, which brings them happiness and well-being. 

On the other hand, the country provides us with opportunities to do business, therefore individuals and organizations engaging in commercial activities ought to make contributions to society. To begin with, the community offers well-built infrastructure and sufficient employees for people to make a fortune, which in turn should be paid back by money-makers. Apart from paying taxes,  Apple company and other international corporations also donate a great sum of money to local charities and the less fortunate, thereby achieving higher value beyond money-making goals. In addition, the wealth in the country can be distributed more equally when individuals and enterprises take their social responsibilities, say, investing their gains into neighbourhoods to render assistance to those in need, thus building a harmonious society with a narrow gap between the haves and have-nots. 

In conclusion, while it is true that individuals and companies in the businesses should spare no pains in maximizing profit, there is a wider role to play for them in society.",8,7.5
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs people to work together. So some people say team sport is the best way for kids to learn how to cooperate with others. In this essay, I shall explore both sides of this opinion and give my judgment to what extent I agree or disagree.

The first reason why teach children team sports is a good way to let them learn cooperation is many sports need more than one person to play. In this situation, collaborating with teammates is a key point to win the competition. In the competition, people need to communicate with each other, know each other and try to use their advantages of themselves. Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy. Not only studying but also doing daily sport activity help children maintain their body and mental health. 

On the other head, some people argue that teach children team sports at school is not a good way to let them learn what is cooperation. Sometimes, too much sports activity can make children distracted in class, they can not focus on their work and it maybe reflects on their academic performance. For those children who do not enjoy sport activity. They do not want to join those competitions.

In conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much.",2,4.5
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In some countries, a lot of people are becoming interested in searching out the history of the house or building where they stay. Generally, it gives an understanding of some communities to know about the historical story and the reason why the building was created. There are some reasons and details to brief about why and how some people were encouraged to find out the background of the place where they lived.

Particularly, buildings or houses in some places had been built because of the environmental situation. It can be seen from the shape and materials of the building which suited the natural plight in the area. For instance, in Japan, homes or buildings were built with light and flexible materials because of Japan's geographic condition that often faces earthquakes. 

Historically, architecture has been evolving until recent decades. It is quite fascinating to some civilizations to learn about architectural design which is related to architectural trends when the building was created. The public might know the reason from the architectural concepts of the architecture. There are some references to know about architectural trends. For example, in the 2000s, it had a minimalist pattern trend which affected  the environmental and economic conditions.

Furthermore, houses or buildings are built because of cultural conditions. Some population created their homes because they had to make a home or building to appreciate their culture. It can be shown from the construction and ancient things from the interior of the building, so humanity is attracted to learn and understand the background and objective.

In conclusion, the population are attracted to learning about the history of their house or the building because they might know the reason and story why the building had created.",7,7.0
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","These days, there has been an increase in the number of people delaying their parenthood. Although this trend has a number of benefits, I believe that the drawbacks will be far more significant. 
There are some reasons why people baulk at the prospect of conceiving children. The first reason is that the cost of raising a child is exorbitant nowadays. Admittedly, most young couples just have meager income, so they will struggle to afford to send children to keep their children well-fed and well-clothed. Delaying pregnancy allows couples to amass wealth; as a result, they will be financially stable before embarking on their parenthood. Another reason is that having children later, people can make the most of their youth. Child-rearing is an onerous responsibility, which can tie people down. In other words, when having babies, couples might spend most of their time taking care of their children, so they will have less time for their hobbies. 
Despite the reasons mentioned above, I do believe that people should consider the drawbacks of this trend. Later childbearing will pose some risks including miscarriage, stillbirth and prematurity. In terms of children, being born premature, they may have to face high risks of birth defects or low birth weight. Apart from that, children born to older parents may be at risk of disorders and diseases, including autism and Down syndrome. In terms of mothers, aged women tend to have more health problems, such as having high blood pressure, which affects negatively on fetus. It also takes mothers longer to recuperate from the labour.
In conclusion, while people can decide to delay their parenthood because of some convincing reasons above, I believe that its disadvantages are more considerable. It is therefore important that couples should contemplate doing so.",6,6.5
The increase in the production of consumer consumption goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this and what can be done to solve this problem?,"It is true that the rise in consumer production has detrimental impacts on the natural environment. This essay will discuss the causes behind the environmental damage and propose potential solutions to mitigate these consequences.

There are two primary reasons why the increase in consumer goods manufacturing poses a threat to the natural environment. Firstly, the extraction of natural resources leads to devastating ecosystem disruption. Consumer goods production heavily relies on the extraction of minerals, fossil fuels, and timber, resulting in habitat destruction, deforestation, and the depletion of non-renewable resources. For example, the widespread demand for electronic devices has led to increased mining activities, contributing to ecological disruption and soil erosion. Additionally, the logging industry for furniture production has resulted in intensive deforestation, causing a loss of biodiversity. Secondly, the energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transportation used for goods delivery account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, pushing the Earth towards a climate crisis.

To tackle these consequences, several measures can be implemented. The first solution is to encourage companies to adopt sustainable sourcing practices to ensure responsible extraction of resources and minimize habitat destruction. For instance, enterprises can prioritize the use of recycled materials and promote sustainable forestry practices, such as tree replanting initiatives. Furthermore, investing in research and development of alternative materials with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable plastics, and renewable energy technologies can help reduce the reliance on scarce resources. The second solution involves governments offering incentives, such as providing tax deductions and implementing regulations, to encourage industries to transition to renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency in manufacturing processes, and adopt greener approaches.

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to address the environmental issues caused by the growth of consumer goods manufacturing. To achieve better results in environmental protection in the future, companies need to be fully aware of the negative impacts and adopt appropriate sustainable practices, with oversight and support from governments. By implementing these measures, we can work towards a more sustainable future and mitigate the detrimental effects of consumer production on the natural environment.",9,8.0
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only governments actions can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that low-quality house construction in big cities can lead to negative outcomes related to people’s lives. I personally believe that authorities are the only organizations that can address this issue.

On the one hand,  high-quality accommodation requires a huge investment which most people can not afford, causing the lack of houses with good conditions resulting in a need for government support. In other words, besides housing, people have to spend their money on other essential services and food, contributing to a consideration for balance expenses. Consequently, individuals with limited budgets take a small amount of money to pay for low-quality housing regardless of risks related to safety. As a result, it is necessary for administrations to be in charge of raising house funds to lend to residents with low interest if they use the loans for good housing. Furthermore, governments can diversify levels of taxes, applying lower taxes for communities with low incomes, helping them to decrease tax burdens, contributing to consideration for better accommodations.

On the other hand, authorities need to enact stricter regulations for house construction processes. The lack of integrity in housing establishments from some organizations is observing an upward trend. It means that they decrease housing investment budgets for personal purposes causing lower amounts of money that can merely afford low-quality building materials, consequently attributed as a main reason for the shortage of housing. Hence, in order to address the aforementioned issue, authorities are the sole institutions which have sufficient power to control this bad situation by banning heavy fines for individuals who are working illegally.

In conclusion, the housing crisis caused by the deficiency of quality can be solved by no one except authorities as they can apply supporting methods and regulations to improve the occurrence",6,6.5
"All fathers should be entitled to time-off from work when their children are born.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Raising children is very difficult. They often start crying in the middle of the night, and because they are immature, the risk of accidents is high. Therefore, parents cannot take their eyes off their children. In such a situation, it is almost impossible to balance work and childcare. Consequently, some people say that fathers should take parental leave. In the following essay, I would argue both sides and state that I tend to agree with the idea.

First of all, it is true that the company will be in trouble because the employees are time-off from work. When the labour force decreases, the firm has to get rid of the situation by reallocate other employees to the blank post. However, if a person who has left was an expert and irreplaceable worker, they might struggle to find a substitute people. Furthermore, during the worker is absent, the company has to support them financially even though they are not working. To sum up, parental leave might be a burden for the company.

Second of all, on the other hand, fathers are responsible to take part in childcare. In the past world, a plethora of people believed that only mothers should participate in nurturing and the responsible for fathers is little. However, in the modern world, both gender should be treated equal and it is same in a relationship of a family. Consequently, since rely only on a power of mothers is unfair, not only mothers but also fathers should take time-off and cooperate to nurture as a parent.

In my conclusion, I believe that the fathers should take parental leave even though the firm will be suffered from getting substitute worker temporarily. As a consequence, I tend to agree with the premise.",2,4.5
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","At present, in most of cities and towns of all countries across the globe, the dispute of traffic congestion is looming large. For this situation, people can not be solely blamed, but many other factors play  significant roles too. To mimic this dilemma, many steps should be taken into consideration by governments.
 
To begin with, among all the reasons, the prevalence is, almost all citizens of the nation use their private vehicles owing to their convenience instead of commuting through (by) public transportation which is comparatively cheaper as well safer. In other words, they do not want to take any risk or face adversity during their travelling and (to) reach to the destination on time. Besides, the other causes behind such complication could be stray animals who wander on roads and due to them sometime the person get stuck in transportation jams. Also there are other factors which have been responsible since (for) many years such as ignorance of (on) shipment rules, ramshackle vehicles, careless pedestrians etc.

The effective possible measures, to make cities and town's traffic–free areas have enlisted below. First and foremost, governments should build sidewalks for pedestrians. So, they may walk safely and do not meet an accident. Another way to tackle this obstacle is, the fuel cost must be increased which ultimately discourage people for utilization of their own vehicles and consequently they are forced to travel either by public transportations or share the personal vehicles. For instance, if two people are living in the same areas and they both are employees of same company then they both can go to office by sharing one car or a motorcycle. In addition, every person must maintain his scooter in good condition. So that it does not cause any difficulty while running and on account of it the speed of other vehicles do not (need to) slow down which might lead to gridlock jams.",5,6.0
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The environmental problem indeed needs the utmost attention. Some think that increasing fuel prices for transportation can be the most efficient solution to tackling the environmental problem. I strongly disagree with that notion, I believe that there is another option that can be more effective than to rise the cost of fuel. This essay will elaborate on my standpoint thoroughly with the following evidence.

To commence with, it is unarguable that the emission of vehicles brings myriad pollution, especially to the air quality. Hence, some people think the idea of increasing the cost of fuel will deliberately persuade people to consider leaving the use of private vehicles for public transportation. However, that notion proved ineffective to tackle environmental problems. Take Indonesia for an instance, the government has implemented the idea of raising fuel prices which depicted the results that people still insist on using private transportation rather than public vehicle. Thus, there is no reduction in the number of active transportation, in other words, there is no pollution depletion occurred.

In addition, there is another solution that is possibly effective to solve the environmental problem which is improving the quality of public vehicles. Instead of increasing fuel prices, the government should pay attention to developing public transportation which is the main reason why the public is most likely avoid to using it. Take Singapore as an example, the massive development and advancement in public transportation such as MRT and LRT is an inevitable success in persuading every resident to utilize that public transportation rather than a private car. As a result, the quality of air in Singapore is improved compared to Indonesia which still lacks of public transportation.

 

In conclusion, it is valid that the numerous active transportation, especially private vehicles is being the cause of the environmental problem that emerged. Thus, the government will deliberately concern about how to decrease the number of vehicles. Although increasing the fuel rate is believed can be effective to solve environmental pollution, focusing more on developing sophisticated vehicles is profoundly effective to attract people to switch their transportation modes. In other words, it can reduce a lot of private car use which can help to solve environmental pollution.",6,6.5
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"In today’s modern society, it can be difficult for students to pay attention or concentrate on lessons at school. The reasons for this are diverse, and thus it requires suitable approaches for children to tackle this problem. 

To begin with, there are certain reasons why children are unable to concentrate on learning at school. First, technological advancement is one of the main reasons. Nowadays, most children have smartphones or computers to study and entertain. This is due to the fact that their parents are so busy with their work, so they cannot help their children to learn at home. Consequently, students can learn on the internet with video records and apps, which are more interesting than theoretical knowledge at school. Second, teenagers have to study long hours every day. Apart from studying at school, they must go to extra classes for many subjects such as math, literature or English. As a consequence, they cannot have a break to rest so they cannot pay full attention to all subjects at school.

To tackle this issue, some measures can be adopted. To begin with, teachers at school should make the lessons diverse for children to increase their interests. For instance, more activities and experiments should be included such as visiting the museum about history after finishing a lesson in this subject. Moreover, parents could help their children to organize a more reasonable timetable for studying. Therefore, students can pay attention and concentrate on subjects at school. Besides, if they have more time, they could develop their aptitude and find out their favourite subject.

In conclusion, there are many culprits of distracting children such as technological advancements and a hectic studying schedule, and their teachers and parents can have a lot of methods to solve this problem.",8,7.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Celebrities play a vital role in modern society. Recently, there have been many celebrities who became famous for their talented singing voices or sport skills like baseketball. These celebrities include singers, athletes, basketball players and even politicians. Clearly, such significant celebrities can spread any ideas and go trends around the world though they may convey false information to young people.

Several celebrities are considerably rich and glamorous though their wealth and glamor are likely to misunderstand young people. That is, the more wealth and glamor celebrities have, the more likely young people would like to become these celebrities. Many young people consider that celebrities are so wealthy that they are able to purchase a tremendous amount of the luxuries. Young people affected by materialism prefer to buy products of expensive brands inclusive of Chenel, Supreme and Apple. Moreover, teenagers who want to be celebrities may take unreasonable videos onto social media websites involving Youtube and TikTok. However, such unreasonable videos can attract many viewers to see and increase the click rates on the Internet.

In order to solve these biased behaviors for teenagers, celebrities should set an example to donate their wealth to charities. In addition, governments are supposed to establish a law to control illegal videos on social media websites and punish those who violate law. In that way, not only celebrities can build a wonderfully personal image in the society but also youngsters are capable of following celebrities with admirable behaviors.

In conclusion, celebrities definitely have a large influence for individuals in daily life. They can bring considerable thoughts to everyone. Nevertheless, teenagers may show off their wealth and make unreasonable videos on social media websites because of these celebrities. If celebrities donate money to charities and governments establish legislation to punish people who upload illegal videos onto the Internet, youngsters can follow the remarkable steps of their favorite celebrities and do help for the world.",3,5.0
"Some people say that what children watch influences their behaviours. Others believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behaviours the most. 
    Discuss both views and give your opinion
","In contemporary society, there are many things which leave significant impacts to children, particularly their behaviors. Due to this fact, some people consider that what the youngsters watch on TV will affect to them. Meanwhile, the others argue that the time they spend on watching TV will influence their behaviors a lot. In my opinion, I concur with the idea that children will be influenced by the content they watch on TV. 

On the one hand, spending a big amount of time on television may result in the addiction of watching many hours. Because the young generations are in the process of development, they are curious about new things. Therefore, children find it interesting in watching TV for undiscovered things as well as their curiosity. 

However, this leads to the fact that eye diseases may be caused. If children focus on watching several hours, the strength of their eyes will be alleviated. Hence, children are likely to have illnesses such as myopic and hypermetropic. For instance, my younger brother had watched TV through days and nights. As a result, he is at level 5 of myopic at the moment. 

On the other hand, the content on the TV will transmiss both benefits and drawbacks. Not only children can be educated by education channels, but also they can be harmed by pornography as well as violable words.Thus, every channels on the television should be controlled by the authorities with a view to ensuring the safety content.

To sum up, both of the ideas will have impacts on the children’s behaviours, but I nuture the opinion that what the youngsters watch will influence themselves.

"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. why is this the case? which development do you think this better?","First, driving a car is more convenient and comfortable than cycling. Therefore, when going to workplaces or hanging out with friends, the car is a reasonable choice. The other reason for this point is when compared with vehicles like cars or motorbikes; cycling is not time effective. For instance, with the same distance, it would take drivers double or triple faster than bicycle riders.

It is also true that riding bikes becoming increasingly popular in some urban areas. Due to exhaust fumes from cars, which may have a devastating effect on the planet and lead to global warming, cycling might be expected to cut down emissions. Also, Riding a bike is essential for health not only maintain a healthy body but also reduce the risk of some diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases.

In conclusion, these points have both pros and cons depends on the urban citizen view. In my opinion, although there are several benefits of driving a car, I would argue that cycling is a greater choice and it should be encouraged by the urban authorities.",2,4.5
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.

And that’s why authorities struggled with lack of residential land where builders can construct fresh accommodation. It is agreed that only government can eliminate this issue. This essay outline actions that can be taken in order to fix it up.

 

It is believed that officials could influence on a a lot of process in the cities. And one of them is encouraging people to move countryside. For instance, in year 2001 town Bakersfield in USA was experiencing dramatic growth. Subsequently,it invoked some unpleasant consequences. So local authorities decided to adjust it by encouraging people to move in a villages. They started used all possible methods to involve people. And one of them is using social media to inform people as for all benefits living in village. Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village. In results,near 15 percentage of local population moved countries.

Returning again to job question, governments of the country should provide more vacancy suggestions in the rural areas, as more than 90 percentage of people moved to metropolis just for getting a well-paid job. It would be nice to mention latest poll conducted by authorities of the Maharashtra province demonstrated that near 35 percentage of youths don’t wanna live in a large city,but forced to do that, due to luck of job suggestions. 

So, If job opportunities increased,people would be more willing to move countryside.

However ,it should be mentioned, that citizens and builders also play an important role in solving this problem. They could help authorities by doing at least something like invest more in building skyscrapers and flats. Apartment usually require less space on the land, whereas, bungalows require it more. 

To summarise, there are some  possible ways to deal with lack of housing is encouraging people to move countryside and provides more job opportunities there. Therefore, shortage of housing can’t be completed solved by citizens ,but for government. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted",1,4.0
"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this contemporary era, every citizen of a country must deserve a basic education in order to survive in the competitive world. Consequently, there has been a growing body of opinion that governments should more invest in educating elderly people who are uneducated rather than spending too much money on the education of youngsters so as to create an unbiased society. Being a rational mind, I, however, take issue with this notion, for I am of the view that concentration on young people’s education helps a nation generates a strong workforce and becomes an independent state.

Among the ratiocination to buttress my stance, the one that deals with the significance of adolescents’ education as a way of producing productive human resources. In other words, if a country gives the highest priority to provide state-of-the-art teaching facilities to its juveniles, after a certain period these children work to change the fate and face of their country.

Thus with a view to having highly qualified workforces, it is paramount to invest money in the education of young people. 

Another critical rationale in reference to why governments ought to focus on juveniles’ education instead of adults’ education is necessarily synonymous with becoming an autocratic and self-dependent state. To be more precise, when youngsters would be highly skilled and educated, a country does not have to depend on professionals, migrating from other nations. This opportunity could not be enjoyed if governments had to spend funds on the education of adults because of their limited learning capacity and age. To cite an example, China has now become a completely self-reliant country only because of giving priority to the education of adolescents. Hence, so as to become a developed nation, young people’s education is vital.

In conclusion, a country’s government should give more concentration on the education of youngsters in order to create productive citizens and become independent.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The younger generation is the backbone of our society. I totally agree that teenagers should be required to do community work in their free time. They should be taught from a very young age about the importance of community service and how it will help the humanity as well as their own development. 

One of the ways in which this can be done is by having schools and colleges include community service as a part of their curriculum. They can have their students do say twenty hours or so of community service each month other than their regular study course. They can provide them with different options each month be it serving at a senior citizens home or orphanage or volunteering to clean the neighbouring roads or parks. Community service will help the teens to be more responsible. They will inculcate belongingness to the community. This will also learn teamwork and leadership skills by working with others. 

Community service will help the community in many ways. It will also reduce the pressure on the government manpower to upkeep the society as they will have helpers helping them. It will also make the maintenance work quicker due to increased manpower. It will also help keep the surrounding clean. The younger generation can also bring in their creativity in community service, which will help both the community and themselves.

To conclude, because community service will not only build responsible citizens and develop their personality, but it will also benefit the community, it is essential to let the youngsters do community work in their free time.",3,5.0
The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"It is often believed that the reach of technological advancements has been one of the reasons for creating a gap between people with different classes of income while others assert that technology is bringing the rich and poor people together. This essay shall discuss both views. In my opinion, I believe technology is creating differences between people with higher income and lower income.

Technology has provided many opportunities for the inclusion of poor people in income-earning activities. Various job platforms have allowed unemployed people to know the employment available and grab the opportunities. For instance, there are applications where people can hire housemaids, which helps housewives to earn a certain level of income. In addition, awareness programs and training are run by different organizations. Also, organizations are providing donations and their products as a social responsibility to encourage the use of technology. There is a company in India which is providing convertible wheelchairs to specially-abled groups of people which can be used for transportation. This has allowed them to get involved in money-generating activities like the delivery of food.

On the other side, the cost of technology is quite higher which may not be affordable for people with a low scale of earning. The major focus of poor people is on basic needs and there is a certain class of people who depend on earning a single day to fulfill their needs on same day. In the context of Nepal, the price of a smartphone starts from Rs. 10,000 which may not be affordable. Moreover, in this materialistic world, the success and hierarchy of individuals are compared based on material possession. The possession of cars, costly gadgets, and so on is considered rich. It is observed that students with such belongings are forming a group and bullying those who do not have one.

In conclusion, though technological developments have brought innovations making the life of people easier and allowing platforms to earn money, other factors associated such as price and impression of people have been contributing to creating differences. The companies involved should focus on how all groups of people could be involved.",6,6.5
some people think that museums should be enjoulyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate people . discuss both views and give your opinion,"Some people argue that museums are entertainment places.while others believe it is an educational places. However I am with museum as educational purposes and this essay will examine the reason.

To begin with,museums from the enjoyable perspectives, individuals prefer visiting museums to enjoy their time and observe the differences between past and present . In  other words, individuals  travel abroad to visit museums in their vacation because they found relaxation and they feel inspired .For instance, the survey done in 2023 at Sultan Qaboos University showed  the number of visitors who visit Oman museums yearly more than 100 thousands  .Therefore, it seems logical that museums are one of the entertainment places.

On the other hand, museums from educational perspective, it is the best way to learn specially for students because explaining subjects likewise history with visible materials it helps to understand the subject better and it gives students cleare idea but, if they study without trip to museum the information in the book is just abstract words . For example according to Oman TV student understands the Mona Lisa subject more when they see it in museums and they know all the details related to this painting.This means it  is a method for studying and the benefits of museums for education purposes is huge, 

To sum up,  although some argue that museums is enjoulyable places because people go there to enjoy their free time. I believe it is educational due to the learning trips give the learners all the information that they need and it is a visible method.",3,5.0
"Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.
The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.
The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.
In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This",4,5.5
Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that to tackle the problem of illness and diseases produced by environmental pollution and housing problems ministry should focus on. I firmly agree with this statement 

rule should take care of increasing environmental pollutions day by day. The principal benefit is our society will stay healthy if there is no air pollution people those who are having asthma can easy cure themself. Secondarily,Our environmental cycle will be balanced with taking strike actions by the government. For instance, the government should make a law against cutting trees and hunting animals because they play an important role in our environmental cycle by giving us fresh oxygen.

furthermore, Some people cut  trees and greenery for their personal benefits.For example, nowadays farmers are selling their land to colonizers to make residential colonies to fend of this government should make apartment buildings to give shelters to many people in one shed. In addition, the government should separate the residential area from the industrial area by which pollution coming from the industries will not effects human health that much.

 In conclusion,there are so many steps that government should take to prevents this problem in positive result. it can be tackled with the collaborative efforts of government and individuals.",1,4.0
"Many university students cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","It is widely known that there are many university graduates who are unable to work in their desired fields after they finish their studies. This essay will elucidate the causes behind this phenomenon and offer solutions to tackle the problems.

To begin with, the most common reason is the fact that fresh graduates usually do not have the technical skills that their chosen profession requires. Possessing technical knowledge is an essential factor that employers consider when assessing job applicants. Meanwhile, university students tend to focus more on theoretical aspects rather than practical sides. Furthermore, this circumstance is exacerbated by limited job availability due to  increasing competition in job markets. To cite an example, there are fewer jobs in government institutions than the number of students holding a degree in political science. 

Nonetheless, there are certainly some steps that can be taken to face those challenges. Firstly, university students should take internship jobs prior to applying to full-time jobs. Having more exposure to the professional world, students can identify the practical skills they need in order to excel in those jobs. After completing internships, they can also consider finding jobs in different cities to increase the probability of finding their dream occupations. For instance, they can try to browse jobs in the top five largest cities in their country. 

In conclusion, the main rationales that hinder university graduates from getting their desired profession are twofold, they are the lack of technical abilities and the low number of job postings. University students can mitigate these by joining internship programs and expanding their job-searching efforts",7,7.0
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this
sets a bad example to the young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that most of the celebrities are well known for their luxurious lifestyle than for their talent or performance nowadays. The majority of people believe that this kind of attitude is not a good example for the younger generation. I am inclined to believe that this kind of behavior would be a bad example for society.

However, there are other famous people who are popular for their outstanding acting or voice

.

On the one hand, it is a fact that many famous people become popular due to their fancy lifestyle, instead of their outstanding achievement these days. Their talent might be standard or below the average, but they are making sensation to the public by showing their wealth and glamour lifestyle. For example, famous American Kardasian-Jenner family who are recognized for their reality television program. In this show they are showing luxurious mansions, parties and shopaholic lifestyle. It is believed that such behavior would have negative influence for the young people and teach them incorrect style of life.

On the other hand, there are celebrities who are popular for their incredible acting or stanning voice. These people have shown to the world that they have achieved success due to strong determination and diligence, and the public will always remember them for their masterpiece and great achievements. For instance, actor and producer Jim Carrey is famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. Before getting the lead role and becoming famous, countless failures were waiting for him. Despite all this, he did not give up and now he is one of the most popular comedian actors today.

In conclusion, even if there are several celebrities who are well known for their wealth, expensive apartments and fancy style of life, there are other celebrities who are famous due to their great talent. In my opinion, I think the public should be more selective in choosing their role models, not just in front of the camera, but we should also see from their personal life as well.",2,4.5
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","In contemporary society, some schools removed abilities such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork because they believe that these subjects should not be learned at school as it is better to learn these from family and peers. Therefore, some think that schools should pay attention to studying academics so that students can succeed and pass examinations. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this proposition believe that it is beneficial for students if institutions focus on curriculums. There is no denying that academic knowledge is important to children to apply for jobs in the future. For example, some positions in a company such as manager, analyst, and executive have to use academic knowledge rather than professional skills. Moreover, when kids learn about physical abilities like woodwork in their free time with their friends or family, they can develop relationships through  cooperation. As a result, institutions remove vocational subjects in order to give more time to learn for students.

On the other hand, those who argue this idea think that schools should not decrease the time the educating vocational curricula. It is obvious that when students exceed focus on academic study, they can get a street which makes it impossible to carry. For instance, when some students do not pass the exam, they may get depressed. Furthermore, some companies need people who have  professional abilities.

In conclusion, schools should not teach capacities like dressmaking but should encourage students to be educated in academic subjects so as to succeed. In my view, I strongly agree with this issue because academic subjects are too easy to find work.",6,6.5
The expansion of multinational companies and increase in globalization produces positive effects to everyone. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement,"globalization and the flourishing of multinational enterprises is a ubiquitous phenomenon and are becoming  the issue of today.such a phenomenon has both positives and negatives impacts on societies ,Nevertheless ,  I am in favour of the idea that showcases  positive development  and I will elucidate on my conviction with relevant examples.

globalization has made the world a small village where it becomes  easier to relocate  from one place to another. many students prefer to pursuing degrees achieving their objectives and passions overseas , in the best world universities.moreover, they may be recruited  in the same country where they studied  or moved to another nation to find  better opportunities ,in addition, many famous corporations  would  bring talented people  for its benefit ,thus, many chances to be considered in the light of globalization, corporates can work globally by working on smooth norms helping other lands to alleviate unemployment rates. For instance, Google is operating in almost every part of the world linking discrete employees. Moving ahead, the social facet is inescapable. When people move  abroad, they meet up and become friends with locals which aids them to know and accept their culture. Therefore, multicultural societies are taking birth welcoming every religion and culture.

furthermore, the more economic advances for a nation the more cons they will get. therefore  having a good strong economy  is the key to better living standards  which uplifted  due to flourished firms in their areas ,consequently, higher wages  and easier life teacher for instance will get double to three-fold salary than what they used to get before . another example, inhabitants will enjoy the new facilities brought to their places  after being isolated ,thus, more shops and recreational centre will be opened .

to sum up, globalization and the advancing of firms are the key points for any community wishing to develop",8,7.5
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","In today's world, traffic congestion is an extremely difficult problem for commuters around the globe. A 10 minutes office to home ride had become a pathetic 40 minutes or even longer ride, spending one's valuable time on roads. This essay will explore some of the causes and recommended practices to reduce this issue.

The possible sources for increased traffic could be from several factors. Firstly, I consider migration of people from urban areas to cities in search of making a living as one of the primary reasons. This, in turn, leads to increased number of vehicles on the road. Based on a recent study conducted by the Transportation Department of London, there is a 20% surge in volume of car sale in the United Kingdom each year over the last decade. Secondly, failing to adhere to traffic rules is another factor contributing to the waiting time due to traffic.

The government and public should be pragmatic about the actions that will solve this issue. The government should encourage using public transport instead of personal vehicles because in my country one will hardly find a co-passenger in a car other than the driver. In addition, the traffic control department should implement stringent traffic rules, for instance, diverting traffic in peak hours on a particular avenue.

In summary, a rapid rise in the car users is one of a major reason for increasingly pathetic traffic congestion. The government and public should cooperate to reduce the number of vehicles by using public transport.",3,5.0
Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It can be viewed nowadays that some people are employed but not according to the degree that they completed in the university. This is because their authority has seen their potential skills not aligned with their bachelor's degree. I strongly believe the administration employs workers according to their skills, not their scholastic qualifications.  In the following paragraphs, I will discuss my point of view to attest to my belief and provide additional examples to support my claim.

Many believe that if someone gets hold of their diploma and earns high marks written in their transcript of records would entitle them to land a good position in their job; however, executives do not see it that way. Graduating from an elite University does not guarantee that your first job will give you a six-digit salary. One should be able to apply all the theories he has learned; with this, the company employee evaluators will see if his skill matches his credentials. As a teacher, when I applied for my first teaching job, I underwent an interview process following a written test. I was asked to do a teaching demonstration in front of the other applicants, which tested my skills to the core. Had I not delivered a proper and satisfying demonstration, I would not have continued to explore and expand my skills further. 

In conclusion, I believe that the association board search for applicants that can perform better than just looking at their inked marks on a piece of paper attesting that they are degree holders. They can hone skills to make such applicants become part of the team and make that employee an asset in the company.",6,6.5
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The majority of people argue that helping children who cannot read and comprehend basic education classes to achieve a brighter future would enable them to pursue even the most challenging careers, such as becoming doctors, teachers, and actors, as long as they have the willpower. In this essay, I will present my perspective on why I agree with this topic and provide a conclusion.

To begin with, those who are interested in children's education argue that supporting teenagers in developing countries is not an option but an obligation. For instance, a comparative study was conducted between teenagers who underwent fundamental pedagogical training and those who did not, at Seoul University. The research team tracked the lifestyles of these young individuals until they reached adulthood. They found that children who received basic education had more stable lifestyles and financial conditions. Therefore, it is essential for young people in developing countries to receive supplementary education.

Additionally, others believe that educating the youth of these nations represents their greatest potential for advancement in various fields, including finance, society, and economics. For example, major Korean companies have been supporting schools in developing countries for an extended period, focusing on education. Many students who have taken these classes over the past ten years have gone on to have successful careers as teachers, nurses, and scientists. Some have even ventured to work in developed countries while simultaneously contributing to the progress of their home countries. Consequently, it is a fact that with access to a basic education system from the outset, they can achieve self-improvement without requiring external support.

In conclusion, as previously mentioned, I firmly believe that these young individuals should receive schooling, and it should be the obligation of their governments to provide free education for a brighter future.",10,8.5
Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"Issues related to the topic are frequently discussed these days. Some people believe that there are many positive developments from cooperating with other countries in terms of business and culture, while others think that it seems to be negative effects in case the identity of a nation is lost.  In the following paragraphs, both of these viewpoints will be examined before a conclusion is reached.

     On the one hand, it is undeniable that business cooperation between countries can increase dramatically economic growth. In other words, when a nation's economy is developed, the country has a huge income, and as a ,result the government can improve fundamental factors for their people such as transportation, infrastructure, and health care centres, as well as people having a good quality of life. Additionally, traditional and cultural exchange will be supplemented the personal development

which implement ideas and technologies from foreign countries to boost potential humans. 

   On the other hand, many people are concerned that this cooperation can lead to the loss of national identity. To explain, there are many significant drawbacks to the partnership of business and culture such as marriage ideas. Take Thailand for example, a wedding before living together as spouse and wife is an identity of Thai culture. This idea might be changed when having contact with people in different countries. 

      In conclusion, even though the two opinions have both benefits and drawbacks, I strongly believe that the advantages of this argument outweigh the disadvantages due to the reason mentioned above.",3,5.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to 
find a way to live with it. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I entirely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have the time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the situation.

There are a number of measures that governments and individuals could prevent, or at least mitigate climate change. Governments can introduce laws to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide which lead to  climate alteration. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, or invest in renewable energy, such as solar, wind and water energy. Similarly, as individuals, we can also limit the contribution to the temperature change, by becoming more energy-efficient, less flying, using bicycles and public transportation. Furthermore, the public can take action by voting for politicians who propose to tackle  global warming, rather than for those who prefer to ignore it.

If instead of taking the above measures, we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. For instance, I am not optimistic that we are able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and jobs, or even worse, they may be forced to migrate to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and we may see  outbreaks of diseases and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

In conclusion, it is obvious that we must make efforts to tackle  climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can accept the phenomenon and live with it.",10,8.5
"Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is believed that it is more advantageous to participate in sports that are deemed pair activities such as football ,whilst a portion of people hold the perception that participating in individual activities ,such as tennis or swimming , is considered more beneficial. This is an issue that considerably affects our choices in athletism and consequently our mode of living.This essay will consider whether the the overall effect of being a member of a sports team is positive or negative.
It is an undeniable fact that by taking part in teams benefits a lot someone's social prowess. That is owing to the fact that social skills are inextricably linked to the way individuals cooperate with each other.A prime example is the athletes in competitions who pay respect to the opponent.Notwithstanding the fact that people realize how they are suppose to behave to others , there is a handful of people for whom doing sports alone offers them more relaxation.
In addition, being a part of a team plays a pivotal role in creating relationships .That is due to the fact that people interact with each other and learn about the personality traits of the team members. In spite of the fact that team provide the chance to become more social , there are team of low quality in which individuals may feel disturbed. A typical example is teams consisted of children at a tender age which may treat unfairly some other members given they differ in color or religious outlook.
In conclusion , it is reasonable to maintain that sports that require participating in teams is not less disadvantageous than individual sports .",8,7.5
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","It is true that delaying childbirth has become an increasingly popular trend among many spouses. This problem happens due to some reasons, and it can have a serious negative impact on not only family but also the community as a whole.
There are two primary reasons why some people do not have the intention of embarking on(can thiep vao, ba tay vao)  parenthood when they are in the early stages of their life. The main cause of this problem is that they desire to enjoy their life to the fullest as a couple and follow  their leisure pursuits. If they become parents, bringing up their offspring will be certainly their top-priority. Therefore, these couples have to spend most of their time staying at home and taking care of their babies instead of chatting or going shopping as they are still single. Another contributing factor is that it might be a huge challenge for newly-wed couples to have a baby while they are not able to support their family financially. In fact, raising children is costly so that they will wait until they can accumulate enough money to ensure a better life.
However, this tendency could have negative consequences in terms of family and society as well. The first impact is that having children late will result in a significant gap between both generations. For example, children may find it challenging to communicate with their parents due to the age gap, which can eventually weaken the family bond. Another negative effect is that children will be less physically healthy when they are given birth late. Some health experts claimed that getting pregnant after 35 years old sometimes carries potential health risks for both mothers and babies. Consequently, this exerts a negative impact on the future workforce.
In conclusion, deciding against having children when they are young is caused by several factors and this problem might bring about several damages which should not be overlooked.",6,6.5
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. 
Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, most individuals chose to have kids in their later age compared to what it used to be in the past. In my opinion, I believe it is more beneficial to have kids at later age than at young age because it makes one fully prepared for child care and also reduces the rate of over population.

On the one hand, there are many advantages of late child birth. Firstly, it enables one to be fully ready for the responsibilities that come with having children. This means that when people delay giving birth till their later age, by then they would have been well established financially, morally and education wise. The reality is that people who give birth early are not yet ready for the consequent duty of care. This difference can be seen when comparing  children education between the American and the Nigerian. Early child birth has made many Nigerian unable to afford their kids' education, whereas, the American which mostly give birth at later age have highest level of children education. It can, therefore, be logically deduced that giving birth at later life prepares one for the task of caring for them. Secondly, giving birth at later age helps to control population rate. If people start having kids at young age, they tend to have many kids before menopause, hence delaying child birth will help individual family to give birth to fewer children.

Despite the numerous benefits of giving birth at later life, it however, has some few drawbacks. First of it is the reduced chances of conception. Scientists have shown that the best chance of conception is between the age of 18 years to 28 years and the chances keep decreasing with age. This means that people who decide to wait till later age risk not having kids at all. Furthermore, delaying child birth could also result in certain complications during labour and delivery. For instance, conditions like miscarriage, early onset of labour and other complications, are associated with pregnancy at later life.

In conclusion, although, birthing children at later age has its merits and downsides, on the balance, I however believe the benefits surpass any drawbacks it may have.",2,4.5

Therefore, more marits are their own life. However,I agree with this statement. I would be discussed in ensuing paragraph.

       Focusing on the primary view, several people are think that main benefits are Schools is best part of children. Because of, They learn educational subject as well some vocational skill, discipline,moral values about life lessons. Besides this, if children is understand values of education, Then they set the goal about their dream and also become a good member of society. To exemplify, Shivam has learn in school and they learn a good skills. Therefore, their skills are make a well known aritists in the nation. They achieve a good artist of the nationally award.

       On the other hand, some primitive steps are individual on their interested skills and also learn their subject related knowledge.Therefore, children set their goal and preparing on their interested field. In additional, either  children can achieve of a good score with graduate their field or more opportunity for good job in a multinational company. Moreover, there are more merits for their performance in job. If they work as a good employee and their ability with skills then more chance to achieve higher salary package as well as more facilities provided by their companies. for instance, kunjan is a best skill for maintenance mechanical petrochemical valve. They solve every problem related to this field because of their a well known person about this product. so, many company provide many facilities as well highest salary package. It is individual merits for kunjan.

      To conclude, it can be finally said that school is a best part for learning descriptive skills and good education to interest field with make a good person in the society as well achieved best job.Therefore, some personally benefits because of their skills helps to become a well known person as well lives their own dream lifestyle.

"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Few people believe that interview is the basic form of selection for a suitable candidate, whereas, other individuals suggest that there are better methods to employ a candidate. I agree with the former view to a large extent. This essay will discuss my idea and shall justify my opinion.

To begin with, most Multinational companies have a structured way to recruit an applicant. They do it by interviewing a shortlisted nominee. To elaborate, Interviews can help to understand the characteristic of the person attending, their approach towards the problem, and how efficient are their solutions. Interviews can also show how good is his or her analytical skills and knowledge about the work. For example, the interviewer can set up a question such that he can have a brief idea of how good is his skills and knowledge.

Another reason why interviews should be a reliable method for choosing an aspirant is, they are flexible to conduct. They have better responses rather than mail questions. Even the people who are not able to write or read can verbally attend the interview. For example, jobs like daily wages, security are certain sectors where people might not be able to write or read, for such jobs interview is the better method to hire.

Although there are new ways to hire a suitable contestant, it is by conducting a competition at the national level and letting the participants do their best to deliver the desired outcome. In such a way companies can find excellent candidates even from second and third league colleges. For example, Larsen and Toubro conduct Technothrone every two years to hire direct fresher from college.

To sum up, Even though there are new approaches building up for the hiring process, however, interviews are still to be the most efficient process to employ a correct candidate.",7,7.0
Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some people believe that people should take steps battling against the climate change, however, others argue that it is not their matter of concern and should leave as it is. I advocate that small change in human activities can save the earth from bad energies of global warming. In this essay i will discuss both views by analyzing how collective action of humans can bring big change, even though the climate change is a natural process.

On the one hand, although the change in environmental weather making life difficult and harming in different ways; Many creatures are in endangered stage,  few think that it is out of control and can not make any change. As a result, many creatures are in endanger stage. Furthermore, It is a part of natural change  and prefereably not changeble. Such as volcano, tsunami, earthquake these are natural calamities and happens as a part of its process not because of human activities, so it should be left as it is.

 On the other hand, many argue that this an effect of luxurious living style and if the way of living is changed, it can be minimized. Peple can contribute their interest by requesting the government to make certain rules and relurate accordingly, suport scientist and encourage them to research more on how to reduce the consequences of global warming, and techonologist to invent new technology, which can stop the bad effect at the atmosphare. Thus, people should take part in saving earth from climate change. The Tesla car can be taken as illustration, which is run by battery that do not  emit carbon gas .

In conclusion, although action of people discharge little or no carbon gas as comparision to what amount natural disasters emit, it can be managed by human power since they are able to think innovatively and invent new technology.",5,6.0
"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds   of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people   think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","An often debated topic is whether a government should provide its country’s artists   with assistance or not. Many believe such assistance is a prudent use of a nation’s   wealth and should thus be supported. However, others feel this kind of spending is   wasteful. Both sides of the argument will be discussed in this essay before a   conclusion is reached.  According to many, government funding of the arts can benefit a country’s cultural   identity. A good example of this is the anime art culture of Japan. Today, anime is a   globally recognized art form and as such, a huge draw for tourists. As this shows,   providing government assistance to artists can have positive ramifications across   different channels within a country. It is thus understandable why many people support this stance.  On the other hand, many argue this kind of spending is wasteful. The core of this   argument typically spotlights developing countries. People basically feel that among   these countries government money may perhaps best be used to solve social problems,   such as establishing safe drinking water and roads to rural communities. When   looking at the discussion in this light, the merits in not utilizing government funds on artists can be seen.  After examining both sides of the question, it is felt that in most circumstances   government assistance to artists begets greater benefits to the country at large. Thus, it   is hoped nations around the world responsibly tailor financial aid to their artists in a   manor that best benefits the needs of their people.",4,5.5
"In some countrie, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","In the present world, there is a huge amount of buildings and houses as many as we can not count. People can look at these in a different way such as  interesting issues or economic products. Both of the ways grap peoples' intention. I am going to explain why the public is getting obsessed with finding out about the history of the house or building they live in and how can they find out information about it.

Firstly, people are trying to research the history of places just because of their curiosity. For example, when folks move to the old house which was established so long time ago they probably care about who had lived here and want to find out whether there had been a famous person or not. Because some people believe that if someone who was really talented or famous they can get  positive energy from that person. This kind of thinking can occur with more older houses than new ones. Eventually, residents start to seek the document of their properties and I am of the opinion that they try to use the management structure of assets. Nowadays the system is quite well arranged in conjunction with the government and everyone can fulfil  research for finding the track of  history.

Secondly, the public uses the timeline of buildings for trading itself. For instance, folks need to know detailed story of an apartment, especially a loan which is issued with the apartment, when they want to sell it to others. In this case, that information can be found in the national land management system which is operated by the government and the trade between seller and buyer will be reliable. Otherwise, all parties can not trust each other and making the contract is not that easy.

In conclusion, finding the root of the properties is significantly interesting to the public. Hence, the government has to rearrange the search system or rehabilitate the old method to find quickly what the public wants to know to follow customer's needs",8,7.5

This essay will demonstrate that teaching the sense of cooperation is the correct way to raise a child, so she will be more useful because it instigates kindness, which makes a healthier individual and a more inclusive society, thus, creating a healthier community.
Although we live in a very competitive world, the constant race for power, a better position corrode the sense of being kind. Every person around becomes a foe, an adversary to be defeated. One may feel entitled to do anything to reach their goals. This behavior will, eventually, change ones personality, making her anxious, depressed if the goals are not achieved or even less prone to comply to the social contract, which results in a more threatening individual than a collaborative one.
A healthy and cooperative society organizes itself around what we call social contract, that is, what we can do or cannot do to not harm the others. This value has to be taught since the very beginning of a person's life; as children have a more open mind; as a consequence of that, one can work on behalf of the society creating a safe space and more inclusive community, where anyone can be contribute, regardless of one's abilities, therefore be useful, in different levels.
In conclusion, I believe that if we want and expect a collaborative community, we need to teach children to be capable to work as a team.",7,7.0
"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers while others argue that the effect is negative.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Sports play an essential role in the child’s positive mindset. Some people believe that competition in sports is beneficial for teenagers,however others are of the view that it imparts negativity among young kids. It is essential to examine both sides of the argument diligently. 

On the one hand, competitive sports inculcate lots of positive effects on a child’s mind. To begin with, a child learns the value of teamwork when they play as a team. The teamwork is invariably the most important characteristic, that comes in handy at the time when a person starts working. Secondly, a healthy competition enables an adolescent to go the extra mile just to win the game. The importance of losing and winning is clearly understood. This results in pushing their boundaries and doing the same in education as well.

On the other hand, there are some unavoidable byproducts of  sports events. The most critical effect of these competitions is the loss of motivation. A teenager becomes low on confidence and is always in need of motivation. Therefore, this impact greatly in further health issues. For instance, panic attacks or nervous breakdown. Moreover, sometimes feud or a sense of hatred inevitably arise when competing with someone. That is another crucial reason for consideration.

In conclusion, playing sports with the goal of winning against someone has both positive and negative impacts on adolescents. Although, a child being underconfident and generating hatred are enormous consequences, yet I believe it is necessary for a child to possess competitiveness to succeed in life.",5,6.0
Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The solutions to the majority of  emergency situations can only be provided by international aid. In my opinion, international help is very crucial in dealing with most of the urgent issues.

Firstly, nowadays financial instability is at its peak. To meet the demands of life, the concept of international cooperation has gained more importance. This has become the immense need of the time, for example, via import and export of goods, various countries try to fulfil each other's needs. This help is of more significance in the developed and underdeveloped countries, where, there is a situation of feminine and starvation, hence  survival is becoming impossible for the local population.

Secondly, a lot of organizations are working hard on the international level in order to maintain peace throughout the world. Some of the countries are currently in huge conflicts. To illustrate this, to resolve such major issues, these must be addressed on the international forums to get a more suitable solution, thus avoiding the risk of wars.

Finally, when a sudden unforeseen incident happens somewhere and people end up being helpless, international help must be made available as soon as possible. To illustrate it further, the earth quacks, storms and the hurricanes etc strike the people and finances of a country harshly, hence for the sake of these people's rehabilitation, international help becomes vital.

In conclusion, I consider that some of the countries being stable are able to fulfil their public's needs, however, most of the countries are facing a lot of challenges these days. Therefore, to deal with this crisis, international cooperation is of great significance and its urgent availability must be ensured by the international organisations to maintain harmony and peace throughout the globe.",6,6.5
"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement.

What is your opinion?","Many argue that the government should look after elderly people and provide them with pensions after they are 60 years old. However, others say that people themselves should save money for later use. I agree with the former viewpoint because savings would not be enough to support people, and residents pay taxes to the government all their lives.

The main reason why the government must take care of old people is that their savings would not be able to support their medical bills, house rent, and monthly groceries. This is because the inflation rate has been quite high in the last few decades and there are no signs that the inflation rate will go down in the coming years. For example, a recent study in the US found that in the coming years, the prices of housing, medical and other necessary items will go so high that it would be very difficult for people to buy certain items. Therefore, it is necessary that the authorities should look after elderly people.

Another reason behind this is that people pay taxes to the government authorities while they are working. The government collects taxes from residents as an income tax, service tax, and property tax. Therefore, people already have paid enough to the state that they can pay monthly pensions to all elderly people. To illustrate, the UK government imposes a 30% tax on income, and the government earns millions of pounds. A small portion of this income should be distributed to people in the form of pensions to older people.

In conclusion, the government should take responsibility for their citizens for their health and financial assistance because monthly savings will not be able to cover their monthly bills, and taxes are paid to the taxation authorities by people all their lives.",8,7.5
some people believe that experience children have before they go to school will have the greatest effect. other argue that experience is gained when they are teenage have a big influence discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Many individuals think that if children take experience prior to going to school it would be more beneficial while others argue that experience has a bigger impact at the age of 18. according to my perspective, knowledge at a younger age is profitable rather than childish age because in teenage people are mature and know about their good and bad things.

on the one ,hand many masses believe that people should take an experience at teenage because they are much knowledgeable at the age of 18. To explicate it, the grown-ups learn many lessons at this age and they remember it for their whole life. Moreover, at teenage people set their goals and work for them In which experience is an accessory. Teenagers not only mature at that age but are also responsible. to cite an example, The New York Times newspaper showed that the humus who took experience at the younger ages now become  successful people. as a consequence, it is quite clear that experience in the teenage influences the life of people in future.

on the other ,hand a plethora of masses think that knowledge at an early age is pivotal,  however I think it is not a good thing because children are immature and they don't have thinking ability. They can easily forget  things. Furthermore, pupils depend on their parents and they do not know much about their decisions, so how they can get experience?.Thus, getting experience at younger age  now become benefited  people.

in conclusion, it is undeniable fact that skills in teenage make humans more responsible and informative; also it in enhances the personality of juveniles according to my opinion, whereas  children are not ready to take the experience at that age as they don't  have the ability to learn things.",6,6.5
"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?","Analytically speaking, the topic regarding the influence of celebrities on youth grabs our immediate attention because of its social significance. On the backdrop of this, I tend to agree with the statement that the young generation is more vulnerable to the negative influence that the lifestyle of the celebrities portrays. Although they do have some positive impact on teens as well, one cannot deny the harmful influence of superstars on the youngsters.
What lies behind the notion that the glitz and glamour are spoiling our teenagers? Social media influence on the young generation is surely one explanation. Nowadays social media give youngsters access to the private life of stars. Certain shows are produced which portray their luxurious lifestyle and their unrealistic approach towards daily life. This gives the false image of a way of life in the eyes of youngsters who are totally obsessed with the perfect lives of superstars. Physical appearance and wearing expensive branded clothes is another. Children especially young girls fantasize about their favorite celebs and are dissatisfied with their body image. They have high expectations to become as picture-perfect as possible.
However, there are certain personalities who are great role models. They are helping society through their charity and bringing awareness in socially deprived areas, but their achievements are overshadowed by high profile celebrities. 
In the culmination of the above discussion, we may assert that there are harms and risks associated with media that is displaying the wrong image of celebrities. Youngsters should avoid excessive exposure so that they should understand the difference between reel life versus real life.",2,4.5
"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Good health and a proper diet are an important part of human life. Certain societies believe the health of the communities of the nation should be maintained by the ruling authorities by taking strict decisions regarding healthy food. Another group of modernists claims that these things should be maintained by each individual on their own choice and plan. In my opinion, the rate of unhealthy people rising significantly, so it is the responsibility of the government to come up with better laws to promote good healthy diet plans among people so that they can shift to healthy life.

To commence with, there are uncountable brands promoting unhealthy products as healthy, their products contain only fats and sugar, but in,marketing they claim these products have proteins and vitamins. Moreover, the community is also not so smart to check what is healthy for a proper diet, as a result the rate of the unhealthy population is rising. In this bad situation, the government first permanently ban all these campaigns and should come up with healthy diet tracking applications which will give complete calorie intake for each individual according to their body mass index.

However, it is an undeniable fact that each person's body reacts differently to different ranges of food, which is why good meals can be allergic or dangerous for them. So it is the responsibility, of society to look towards their daily diet plan, that can actually help them to live a healthy life.

In a nutshell, each aspect has its pros and cons, although maintaining own diet plan according to their body is important because this will protect an individual to save themselves from allergic food, I believe the responsibility of the government to launch diet applications and promote healthy lifestyle campaigns will help thousands of individuals to start nutritious life.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Right after school, teenagers wonder whether they ought to continue studying at university or get a job. Some people believe that keeping on studying can guarantee a successful career whilst others opine that getting a job immediately after school is the better option. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in depth. 

On one hand, students can vastly expand their knowledge in the university which helps them groom themselves and excel in their professional fields. Graduates can have more opportunities to get high-paid jobs because University prepares them to meet the academic qualifications most employers want. For instance, in many countries, students who graduated with an engineering degree are highly paid and have an easy time getting jobs. Moreover, experts need to be educated to work in specialized jobs that are beneficial for society. For example, a medical student has to spend about 8 years to get proper knowledge and improve vital skills for their future career which helps the community in turn by providing advanced treatments. The above benefits are only guaranteed by higher education.

On the other hand, pupils could use their time and youth more effectively by starting a professional life right after school. In some fields of study, universities use obsolete data which are useless for today's society's needs; spending years in these institutions is a waste of money and life. Furthermore, a person who prefers to work rather than pursue higher education is more likely to obtain hands-on experiences and skills, which bring them more revenue as soon as possible. For example, Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world, dropped out of the educational institution to pursue both his talent and desire in the computer science field. By skipping a college degree, one can progress in their chosen professions and earn money earlier.

In conclusion, each side of view has unique opportunities and conditions. Thus, choosing over one another depends on an individual’s preference and priority.",10,8.5
It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In primary school, especially in the countryside in Japan, primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables. In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.
Firstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.
In addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.
Finally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.

"In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?","In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.",9,8.0
"Interviews form the basic selecting criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods.
Do you agree or disagree?","The success of any business depends on the quality of it's staff and recruiting new employees can be a long and painful process. There are multifarious approaches so that I agree with given statement. This essay intends to analyze methods of hiring new employees.

Unquestionably, an interview is an important recipe of recruitment. It requires a detailed understanding of the organizational needs as well as a careful grasp of the prospective employee's responses. However, an employer can not fully access a candidate's capabilities, personality or charach during an interview. Sometimes, a candidate who possesses better qualifications may fail to get the job because of his poor performance in the interview. This system would be fruitful, when the recruitment is a small scale and only a few employees are needed.

There are many other methods, which can be employed to hire personnel. In my opinion, interviews should not be the only criterion for selecting candidates. It should be used in conjunction with written tests during which a candidate's proficiency and knowledge in various subjects can be assessed. In addition, candidates should be asked to participate in debates or group discussions. Their real personality and leadership skills will come on the floor during these events. After this, it is important to check the reference to ascertain the authenticity of what is written in the resume.

Analysing the above mentioned methods, it is inevitable that no single method is perfect. Each job has its own requirements. Qualification is more significant for some jobs and other requires experience. External recruitment agencies can be assigned the task for searching for suitable candidates for jobs, but it may be very expensive. However, I believe that spending on the recruitment of new employees can prove to be good investment, as good personnels can breathe new life into your business.

To sum up, it can be restated that finding suitable employees is an arduous task and has to be a combination of written examinations, group discussions, interviews and reference checks.",1,4.0
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the cause of this ? what can be done to solve this problem.,"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas. The burgeoning in the manufacture of customer goods outcome in damage to the natural surroundings. In my perspective, this essay will explicate some of its causes as well as some problems to solve this matter. 

To commence with, there are the predominant causes first one is. Pollution demand. To explain it, most of the people who are living in the society and other streets they use a plastic polythene, and when they buy from  the market when they finish their packet they through on the road, nor they do not put into the dustbine. However, it might occur some kind of unsaftyness of the masses. In other words, when the garbage collector comes in the street to pick the waste material they go to the cabinet store to through all these waste products and then they and then they do fire on it after that pollution is create around the areas. Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack. Secondly, the main point is that less opportunities of job available in the factory. It means, if customers do not comes in the factory or shop to buy the garments so the owner of the factory will loss their sales in daily routine. Moreoso, if new fresher comes to the shop for job vacancy and the manager of the shop says their is no available and also they give a less salary to employees who working in the shop.

On the other hand, there are some Of the Tribble to solve this matter. To explain it, government should take high funds from the people and also provid some awareness and campaigned programs among society persons. In other words, there should be hight panelty to consumer goods who are doing these things. 

To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit.",1,4.0
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"Combustible is considered as the main reason for environmental issues in society for a portion of individuals who believe that the solution to cope with the problem is raising it's. In this essay, I will examine some facts that convince me of why this is not the major solution and then some examples will be exposed.

Firstly, to raise fuel's price affects the economy of a country. As a great number of goods depends on local transports such as trucks, vans, car and suchlike. Therefore, this action would be reflected in the final price of these goods which would lead the final consumer to pay the bill. For example, if a supermarket depends on trucks to receive their manufactured goods they would have to increase their prices due to the fact that trucks mostly rely on costly combustible to arrive in the supermarket.

Another reason why I support this notion is that recycling can bring about more benefits than by increasing fuel's prices. It is known that less than 25% of the countries in the world have been enticing people to recycle in the last decades. As a consequence, all the garbage produced by all other 75% of the countries is not controlling garbage treatment which is triggering a high impact in the environment in an unprecedented way. For instance, in emergent countries, people tend to throw litter in rivers, lakes and so on, thus, they are prone to have issues with water in a near future.

In conclusion, I believe that there are better paths follow instead of increasing the price of fuels which means that this action would actually harm the economy of a country. Considering that, governments should focus on managing the recycling system in their countries which would improve the environmental at an alarming rate.",11,9.0
"Some people shay that advertising has positive economic effects, others think is has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While some people argue that advertising has many merits such as accelarating businesses' income, others say that it has many detrimental issues that lead to impulsive purchases and making people dissatisfied themselves. 

On the one hand, advertising is a main tool for businesses, making their new products and services more familier for customers. In contrast, consumers find easily things,that can be useful for daily necessities, via advertisements on the TV's, newspapers and other advertising materials.",0,<4
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Education is of prime importance to the children. Whether or not a child should be Homeschooled is a very personal opinion and belief of the parents. Formal knowledge starts at the age of 3 right until lifetime. Everyone should have the right to be educated. This way  of study such as happens in the form of a brick and mortar or the education can happen in the house. Moreover, the choice is left with the parents to decide which of the two to opt for. In this essay, we shall discuss the pros and cons of the statement.

The advantage of home school would be parents have utmost control. Another would be instilling religion. This study at home concept is useful for kids who are handicapped in any form. The self confidence is upheld. In other words, the morale of the growing adult is always high. Few parents who wish for their kid to visit the museum more often and to do more outdoor course for learning in the house.  Some more parents are dissatisfied with normal schooling due to lack of solid educational institutes. For example.  Learning on your own in  the United States constitutes the education of about 3.4% of U.S. Students (approximately 2 million students).  

However, the biggest disadvantage would be the student having problems to socialize.  The individual may even have problems to communicate. Furthermore, making friends would be a difficult task in hand. The kid would have never handled exams and homeworks. How to deal with pressure is something not taught at home. Not only is the person unprepared to face the world, but also are unaware of the unknown. 

To conclude, way of schooling is a choice left for the parents to decide for their kid. Home learning has its own pluses. Finally, in my opinion everyone should have the opportunity to be in a proper school as it makes him/her prepared for the future. 14 years of education in an institute is unmatched and unparalleled.",7,7.0
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"People may have thought that teenagers should help the society in their spare time without any return to gain both personal and social outcome. I disagree with the idea that teenagers must to do the unpaid work, and I believe that it can still be beneficial by doing other kind of things.

On the one hand, adolescent should not be asked to do extra works without payoff. The main reason is that the youth have right to choose what to do on their free time. Teenagers can spend their extra time in finding their interests or relaxing. For instance, students who are busy in weekdays might want to use their free time hanging out with friends rather than doing community affairs. Furthermore, some youngsters are responsible for family’s financial support that they have to take a part-time job for houseware and the tuition fee.

On the other hand, there are other types of thing that juvenile can do to benefit both individuals and societies. Firstly, they can learn some skills based on their interest. For instance, those who enjoy swimming can get a life guard certificate, and that’s not only for a sense of honor, but also an ability to rescue drowning people. Secondly, students can have an internship in a company to achieve bountiful experiences, and may lower the city’s unemployment rate. Lastly, they can choose to take a rest and think more about future, which is important to career development.

In conclusion, teenagers should not be taught to help local communities if they have more time, and they can gain extra benefits by using their time on finding their interests, having internship or just relaxing.",5,6.0
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing shortages is the major problem in the cities. In many big cities government is trying to solve the problem. However, I disagree with the aforementioned statement that only government should play a pivotal role to solve shortages of housing in the big cities due to the reasons outlined below.

Firstly, People believe that the government can only solve housing shortages in the major cities. This is to say that, In the massive number, People are moving from rural place to a developed cities in search of better facilities. As a result, The population of a particular place increases and the shortages of housing will arise. To illustrate, according to the New York Times, 15% of population has increased from migration in the capital city 'Kathmandu' in the fiscal year 2019/2020. Furthermore, The governement should play a role to limit migration and manage a proper plan to develop every cities of the country. Similarly, In the massive cities, the authorisation should focus on proper plan on housing.

Secondly, With the major role of the government to control the housing planning . The citizens also have important role to control housing shortages. In the other words, The general public should take knowledge about the proper housing plan before they seattle in any locations. For instance, according to the Himalayan Times, 5% of people who seattled in the area of New Baneshwor had been found to be living in the government land. As a result, The authorisation is planning to remove the households.

To sum up, The government plays a pivotal role to solve housing shortages with it the citizens also play a crucial role to the solve it.",4,5.5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give you opinion,"It is often argued that art should be a mandatory course for pupils, whilst others disagree and think it is a total loss of productive hours. The former group has that opinion because they are aware that arts play a very important role in understanding the history of our origin, whereas later believes that it is of no practical importance, and should be indicted from the school syllabus. Consequently, the essay agrees on the importance of its existence and justifies it with relevant arguments and examples.

It is clear that art should be a prerequisite course in school because it acts as a bridge between the past with the present.  Any piece of art that is ever created, conveys the story of the past, and event that was happened which resulted in its creation. For instance, Taj Mahal in India, which is one of the seven wonders, was created to illustrate the unconditional love of Salim for Mumtaz.

On the other hand, many disagree and feels that it is waste of time as it has no practical application. Currently, parents want their children to study subjects, such as science and maths, which will make them doctors and engineers, which will subsequently land them a high paying job and an opportunity to build a successful career. Despite this, as the world is filled with artists who are more famous and earning twice the amount as compared to doctors and engineers. For example, as per the recent Billionaire list published by Forbes Magazine, there were 10 artists featuring in there in contrast to only 5 Doctors and engineers combined.

Therefore, according to me, a student should mandatorily study this subject as it will be difficult for them to cherish their past, plus they have an immense opportunity to build a successful career in it.

To conclude, creating a bridge between past and present through which humans can relieve the memory is an explicit benefit of studying the subject, on the contrary, some do feel that it is a waste of time because of its minuscule practical importance. However, there is an immense opportunity to develop it as a career which is exceptionally rewarding and satisfying.",8,7.5
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? ,"There are different views about the increasing popularity that online classes have gained in recent years. I personally believe that this method of course delivery has both advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, the rise of online courses as a replacement for onsite classrooms comes with a number of benefits. Firstly, one of the most significant merits of an Internet-based class is that it is convenient. Instead of attending traditional classes which may pose challenges to students who do not live in proximity to the campus, they are now enabled to attend an online class taught by the same instructors while staying at home using an Internet-connected computer. In addition, online degree programs are more affordable for those from financially disadvantaged families as students enrolling in an online course can save money that would otherwise be spent on transportation costs, campus-based housing and other living expenses. 
On the other hand, there are several drawbacks associated with this trend. The lack of instant support from teachers and faculty members is one of the major problems faced by online college students. Due to the absence of face-to-face contact, the entire process of getting clarifications and query-resolutions online can take much more time compared to seated classes at the University. Another negative aspect of online education is that students are not likely to develop social competence as effectively as they can do with physical classroom settings. This is because video- based lectures often limit the opportunity for interactions and communication among students, which is equally important as the acquisition of knowledge.
In conclusion, it seems to me that while online education is generally more accessible than classroom-based courses, it may prevent students from receiving timely assistance and cultivating interpersonal skills.

some people think that government should provide assistance to all kind of artists including painter musician and poets etc. however other people think that it is a waste of money discuss both view and give your opinion.,"Many people's lives are richer because of art, music, painting pictures sculpture poems and dance.There are some who claim that it is important to support the composer and others who are opposed to rule funding.This essay intends to analyse both perspective, howeverhowever side with the former view.
There are many reasons why unions should fund artist.The contributors of painter to the society are very essential.Art can bring out people creativity view and personalities.For example, we learn about our history, tradition and culture through movies, songs and painting made by artist.Artist are the media of diffusing tradition.All kinds of tradition are the basis of a country without which the country cannot be civilised.Swadisht are the ambassador of culture and play a vital role in the valuing the level of civilization of the country. What is a major form of cultural abundance.
Another important aspect of this is that it is an ancient means of communication. Our language is a result of people need of communicating. What is what differentiates us from animals. Art is our soul and it is a source of courage. Art also entertain us.finally government should fund artist because earning a livelihood from art is difficult, especially in the budding stages.
Opponents of government funding on artists say that money spent on the arts could have been used for considerably more vital purposes. They have strong reason as a nation's health and well being should be paramount. The idea that elderly people are forced to wait for essential operations whilst the money be required to increase available medical provision spent on opera and ballet in plainly immoral. There are also more deserving social causes of the money that should be considered before the arts. Homelessness unemployment illiteracy all of these deserve to be addressed before money is spent on what is initially little more than entertainment.
To summarise, I would like to say that even thought both sides have a strong argument spending on ART is a must but fund allocated for spending on basic health care and education should not be diverted to the arts.There should be separate funding for heart as it is as important as other basic necessities.",4,5.5
Job applicants’ social skills are more important. Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In this modern world, the staff has to be talented in multi skills especially, should be able to possess social values rather than qualifications. I strongly believe social skills help an individual to be more effective and efficient in their work area.

To embark on, there are many reasons why these values are important to the company as well as to society. Communication ability is the first and foremost a worker should have when working in any position. To be more precise, in order to express the concerns and suggestions labourers should have this ability, which not only helps them to convey ideas but also to work as a team member. For instance, companies with good teamwork results in greater productivity due to the staff's positive approach. Additionally, a worker should be a good listener, then only that person can work effectively with other staff. For example, a manager, who is a good listener can easily understand the employee's issue and will be able to resolve it.

Moreover, another ability the staff should express is a helping mentality, it is the same as an empathetic approach. They will be in need of help from each other especially when teamwork is needed. To illustrate, a new employee will need help from the senior staff to understand the new environment, in this situation, the experienced staff can help this situation the experienced staff can help this worker only if he has the helping mentality. Hence, social values should be possessed by all staff.

To recapitulate, good qualifications are important to get a job, however, social skills are more significant when compared to educational degrees. A worker must have good communication and listening ability.",2,4.5
"MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE

BECOMING SERIOUSLY OVERWEIGHT. SOME PEOPLE  SAY THAT THE PRICE INCREASE OF FATTENING FOODS WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

TO WHAT EXTEND DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?","Last researches, parade marked raising in obesity rates in the world. Some thoughts assume that we could reducing this issue by impose higher cost on unhealthy food. However, it's not a surefire way also not fair.

People who reap high remuneration don't care about extra-taxes as money don't constitute any impediment for them, to illustrate, increasing fatten food few dollars is nothing for them. Consequently it could influence just low income people.

Moreover, by applying such solutions, it will generate a financial problems for a numerous ventures as well as economic issues, because processed food not only important industry it is economic changer. so, huge companies in this sector for example, kfc, macdonald's and pizzahut, will not obey this measures.

There is always another side to a coin. so for sure increasing price for processed products such as, burger, pizza and instant pasta, might regulate this phenomenon, because it will minimize the desiring in such products, in other words, it can change the consumer conduct. also this extra levy could use in improving obesity health centers, furthermore make conceived advertising companies to expand the knowledge about overweight matters.

In conclusion, although levy more charges on fatten foods could manage the issue, it is not the optimal solution. Thus, we should looking for other ways to cope with this matter.",0,<4
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some perspectives suggest that conducting group exercises on campuses is crucial to cultivate young individuals with the capacity for cooperation. In my perspective, I could only partially agree with opinions as such, since there are other ways to achieve the same goals.

To begin with, it is inevitable that playing group sports could train young individuals to work together, such as playing volleyball and baseball. To win a game, youth need to learn how to support others instead of focusing on personal performance. It is similar to working in companies as part of teams, where employees will have better results by supporting each other.

On the other hand, there are other means of teaching to facilitate the capacity of cooperation, including group presentations, or throwing big events on campuses. It provides more opportunities for students to discuss detail, or brainstorm with group members to come up with solutions and ideas to address problems. Group members with different backgrounds and interesting could teach students to embrace different inputs and explore different possibilities. For example, some universities ask students to hold final exhibitions before graduating which requires the participants of the whole class. It forces students to step out of their small social circle and learn how to work in a diverse environment, preparing them for real societies. 

  

To conclude, it is true that playing group sports could enhance the capacity for cooperation, since they need to work together to win games. However, I believe that assignments from educators could provide more diversity in a group, allowing young individuals to learn how to work with people who have different perspectives.",7,7.0
Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree),"In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS label 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Volunteering helps in various aspects, some argue that teenagers must do volunteering in their free time and that it is beneficial to both the teenagers and their communities. in my opinion i agree, for a couple of reasons that i shall discuss.

unpaid community work can be helpful to teenagers, through enabling them to learn new skills, be exposed to working environment, develop their personality and perhaps even make a career choice. although, they might complain, utilizing free time to actually be useful grants a sense of accomplishment. furthermore by filling free time with serving the society, this closes the door on harmful activities, which teenagers are the most prone to, such as crime and illicit drug addiction.

similarly, volunteering has positive effects on communities. In regards to city budget, and resources as well as the public image (for example : cleaning beaches). as well as the additive effects of decreasing crime rates and addiction. the regular activity of volunteering makes a healthy community, that is active, and stable.

it also helps with better outcomes for the environment, health system, and safety.

in summary i wouldn’t say teens should be required, but rather encouraged to participate actively in unpaid community work.",0,<4
"Some people think that robots are very important for humans’ future development. Others, however, think that robots are dangerous inventions that could have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The contemporary society has witnessed a leap forward in science and technology, which means technological innovations like robots are seen in many places. Some hold the view that robots are crucial for future development. However, there are people reckoning that robots are detrimental to human society. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my own opinion. 

It is hard to deny that robots have brought many benefits and convenience to human. For example, AI robots are able to reach the places where human can not reach and conduct scientific researches or bring samples from deep down in the ocean or the core of the earth for further researching purpose. From this perspective, robots are contributing to human's future development. What's more, robots can also liberate people from mediocre jobs such as waitering and waitressing or delivery services. With robots doing this repeated job, people can spend more efforts on exploring outerspace or other fun activities. Therefore, robots exert an positive effect on human's life.

However, negativities or sides effects may also come with what we call ""the digital revolution era"". Since robots are able to replace jobs that are repetitive, the job market may suffer from fluctuation. For instance, given the fact that jobs are taken by robots, people who lack specific skills are hard to find their places in the society. Therefore, it is hard for them to secure a job. Despite the fact that some robots have the ability to take care of infants, those who are raised by these machines could find it hard to interact with people as robots can provide necessary care and nutrition for babies, love and company are more precious for infants. As a result, robots could have negative effects on society.

From where I stand, we should use robots wisely because they can bring both convenience and consequence to us. We should use use it as a tool to make our life better instead of being controlled.",2,4.5
Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Since time immemorial, the invention of artificial intelligence has been man's major objective. There is an ongoing argument about the presence of robots on planet earth. Many people believe that it will be a great innovation while others think it will have adverse effects. This essay would take an exhaustive look at these views while I conclude with my own opinion. 

   One major reason why robots are important to human survival is that  they help ease labour. In today's world, many construction companies and factories tend to be more productive by introducing artificial intelligence to their daily operations which makes production and construction seamless and more effective. In 2009, Jung Sung a textile factory owner from China stated that production has skyrocketed by 200% since they introduced artificial intelligence into their manufacturing process. Robots are essential for the reduction of human labour they help increase productivity.

    The major negative side of robots' reality is that they will cause unemployment. Hence, there would be no jobs left for humans due to the inability to compete with automated technologies that are specially created to be way more effective than humans. In 2012, the Chinese government carried out  research which stated the cause of unemployment in their economy and it was concluded that the existence of  artificial intelligence reduced employment drastically. It is pertinent to say that introducing robots to planet earth will reduce job opportunities.

   Conclusively, robots can be a source of unemployment for humans but we can say that the existence of robots has lots of merits such as high productivity in labour and effective operations due to the way they have been programmed to work tirelessly without rest. The invention of robots would aid growth which would help factories, construction sites and other related organizations beat their set targets due to the initiative.",6,6.5
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession.What factor may have caused this situation and what in your opinion, should be done it.","University graduates are dreaming to get an occupation in line with their chosen profession. They hope by enrolling in university will help their professional career in the future. However, in reality it is hard for them to meet their professional expectations. In this essay, I will describe factors that may lead to this situation.

Firstly, it is because of the limited experiences that they have. Experiences explained here not only talk about work but also others experiences such as organizational, group activities, and all works related to campus. This might happen because in university, scholars tend to have their own choice of education courses. Then, sometimes they choose not to be involved in any other projects or organizations because it might be helpful for them to focus on subject matters only. By doing so, they do not realize that all activities outside campus give them points plus to add into their curriculum vitae which is necessary in time ahead. In my opinion, In order to avoid this situation, it is very crucial for universities to make mandatory program activities not only about working but also organizations such as internship, exchange students so that undergraduates must participate actively. Hence, when they finish their school they definitely have experiences in their resume.

Secondly, getting a job for recent graduates is very competitive. It is simply because every year the universities produce workforces and the company available is limited. Hence, I think it is better for the university to have some entrepreneur programs offered in order to prepare the sophomore to think not only about having employment but also to open business to the public. Indeed, it will create a job market for everyone and to increase economic activities in a country.

Finally, universities need to offer various programs to boost careers for students. Since the graduates lack experience in the working field, they need to prepare for it.",4,5.5
Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"In contemporary society, the primary purpose of schooling has been under heated debate. Many people hold the view that transforming students into good citizens and workers is the fundamental goal of education rather than concentrating on individual betterment. From my perspective, I agree with the given sentiment and this course of the essay will elaborate carefully to provide the reasons for my personal opinion.

First and foremost, it is likely universal that a good individual should be useful to certain communities. It means that a well-skilled person might not be defined as a good one if those harms or are unsupportive to society. Therefore, schools in which children's perspectives could be changed officially and openly should mainly focus on educating moral lessons and qualifies alongside particular subjects or skills. Being community-minded, for example, seem to be a necessary characteristic which is needed to be taught by school education, especially in fast-paced life in which there is likely sympathy insufficient. In a nutshell, a community could not be prosperous unless every single citizen is dedicated to bigger purposes.

However, it is indicated that generally moral lessons are unlikely the only target of schooling since the development of societies relies significantly on single and personal innovations. specifically, Throughout the countless year of humankind's life, there was numerous innovative inventions and explorations that were undertaken by genius brains that have been changing human life totally and positively such as America's exploration and invention of the internet and computers, or chronic disease treatments. Therefore, alongside the primary goal, seeking and nurturing individual talents should be taken into consideration in order to create a quality workforce for our community.  Seeking talent shows, for example, specific courses, and modern facilities should be provided free for children when they are still in school seats.

In conclusion, in spite of individualism development in contemporary society schools should play the main role in educating the young generation to turn out useful and well-educated people in their community. Besides, increasing personal betterment is not likely less crucial, however, it does not seem the major purpose of education.",4,5.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they lie in.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Nowadays, many individuals are showing attitudes towards the history of the place they live in. This phenomenon is rising globally and thus the need for finding proper ways to gather data. In this essay, I will explain  some major reasons behind this trend as well as how to search for related instruction. 

To begin with, a group of individuals are very interested in the background past of where they live. Firstly, having as much as possible information about a residence record in various items like the quality of its original materials and its durability over time makes the current owner of the house aware of the possible weaknesses and how to deal with them with regard to the previous possessor’s experiences. for example, a building made of strong materials and a history of good standing against environmental problems, especially destructive storms, could be a reliable place to live in harsh conditions. Secondly, some folks have special beliefs in Supernatural beings and their power to influence humans’ daily life lives. Thus, they might search for anything related to their concerns before buying a residence. For instance, if these people find out a building has so-called hunted in the past by some supernatural creatures, they would definitely hesitate to purchase it.

There are numerous ways in order to get a dossier almost about any topic. Firstly, it can be searched on social media and some platforms such as Google in order to gather data about the place they want to know. Secondly, asking  some of the old residents in neighbourhood neighbourhood could be a good idea as well.

In conclusion, people's tendency towards getting information about the history of the house they are living in is increasing. There are different reasons behind this phenomenon within the population. However, if they want to know about the background of a building, there are easy and available ways like using the World Wide Web and also in-person interviews.",7,7.0
"Some people say that public sports facilities improve people health problems. Others argue that this development has insignificant effects on public health.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","While some citizens argue that the provision of public sports facilities has tremendous effect on improving the public health,others,in contrast,think that it has no considerable impact on the health of general citizens.This essay examines both views and explains why I think the need for a physical facility is incredibly important.

On one hand,many citizens and I believe that the development of centre for physical activities can have a considerable effect on the mind and body well-being of individuals.If the access to facilities such as tennis,badminton and other sports are provided at an affordable,reasonable price,people do not fear to step out to spend their time exercising.For example,any free or cost-effective provisions,motivate dwellers to challenge their comfort zone. As a result,the major cause of obesity,which is, less bodily movements can be eliminated.So,the health complications can be minimised to a greater extent.

On the other hand,few others defend that there is no need for any capital investment in physical activity centres.For these people,the citizens of the nation have no time,amidst their tightly packed work schedule.Despite the construction of a greatly attractive sports facility,non-availability of time will only result in a huge loss of money. Evidently,individuals do not find time to stand and stare,or in other words,more specifically, the sports buildings are no benefit for the general public.Instead,more awareness can be instigated for the reduced intake of junk and unhealthy products.

In conclusion,despite the belief of few that funding in sports wouldn’t benefit human society as there is not enough time for them to utilise the facility,like many others,I strongly agree with the plan of introducing recreational centres for the health benefits of all.Therefore,it is strongly recommended for the emergence of leisure activities.",8,7.5
"Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees
better at their jobs. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is suggested that employees should be given at least a 4-week annual leave to imporve their working efficiency. While I understand the importance of having regular breaks, I disagree that the holiday should be as long as 4 weeks.

On the one hand, knowing that after a long time of dedication rewarding will be awaiting, employees will have motivations to work harder and put more efforts into their jobs. It can also be mentally beneficial for people. For example, an employees nowadays are always under tremendous pressure for they have to work overtime frequently. They spend almost all of their time on their jobs that they do not have time for their family and friends. Giving them a certain days of vacation would help them balance work and life better and therefore release their stress and tension. It can hence be argued that providing employees holiday is beneficial.

On the other hand, a 4-week holiday is too long for the company that it may affect the normal operation of the company, and even the whole society. For instance, the modern society is moving so fast that every second a new idea could be launched. Employers are competing with one another on a timely basis. With the position being vacant for a minimum of one month will definetely be harmful for the productivity and efficiency of the coroption. Moreover, it may also arise contradictions between colleagues. If the team members have to cover tasks left by the person who is on long vacation, it will increase the already heavy workloads of these members and result in low efficiency.

In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential pro

blems of giving long holiday to employees are more significant than the possible benefits.",2,4.5
"In some parts of the world, it is increasingly popular to research the history of one's own family. Why do people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?","In recent years, family history research has been becoming more popular than it was. In my opinion, I would argue that this trend should be as a positive development.

There are several factors for encouraging the study of our family history. In the first place, curiosity is the main cause that leads to making people intend to dig up about their family traditions. They would desire to know their roots, where our forefathers came from or how they earned their living. In the second place, some people must take in family history because of the fact that they would have health problems and one of them is genetically inheritable medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes. In reality, understand genetic make-up provides an early lifestyle intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of these diseases.

Doing research on family traditions renders countless rewards and this may be an amazing journey which could blows our mind. Firstly, offspring may find it astonishing to dig up the details of their predecessors' lifestyle or some of the achievements that ancestors attained throughout their lifetime. In fact, no other activities can bring an experience like this. Moreover, learning about a family tree would be a means of self-motivation. For instance, we could drive ourselves through any difficulty when we realize that our ancestors overcame the seemingly insurmountable obstacles, to regard our difficulties as trivial ones.

In conclusion, researching the origins of a person is becoming more popular in society and I believe that it is a positive development.",5,6.0
"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is sometimes argued that the main approach of education is leading children to become well-behaved citizens, rather than to bring them benefits as individuals. In my opinion, I totally agree with that viewpoint because of some reasons that I will mention in this essay.

First and foremost, the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them  become beneficial to society. Almost the time that students spend at school is for learning logical and social subjects which are crucial to cultivating their thinking and behaviour in society in the future. Moreover, this knowledge may be practical in work and help them to get more achievement in their career paths. For example, governments put Physics as a compulsory subject in the education system in each country to improve their learning for students who want to become researchers and engineers and move up the career ladder in the future.

Secondly, benefiting students may make them more selfish and self-important in many ways. This means students could be paid more attention at school. However, catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations, and they may have bad behaviour to improve their opinion. For instance, to protect their opinion, some students may have violence and have some wrong methods to change others' thinking. Meanwhile, teachers may allocate more time to look after their students and may have some difficulty changing their teaching method due to justifying students' actions if they have any bad behaviour in the education area.

In conclusion, I concur that school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields, instead of benefiting them as they desire. In addition, parents can become their children's partners with the support from schools to help them to acquire more knowledge and not to overprotect them. Thus, they can become good individuals in the future.",5,6.0
Some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"in some places around the world, a growing number of house owners are becoming more curious about the historic past of the houses they live in. Adding financial value, unavoidable maintenance and growing relations are why this curiosity is newly formed, these historic intelligence could be acknowledged in several ways. 

People's Curiosity could be caused by a range of reasons. firstly, I Imagine that knowing the building's history could add some economical value to it. this is so that these homeowners could gain better prices whenever they plan to sell or rent out their properties. secondly, by gathering more information about the age of their assets, preventive maintenance can be regularly carried out to increase their lifespan. lastly, awareness of the building’s past could strengthen the residents’ relationships by sharing one house's history.

Different ways are used to search for information regarding a building’s history. Such details can be obtained from the town’s local library, where old archives are kept and surely reliable. Moreover, Online websites can be a way to learn more about the historic facts wanted. Furthermore, asking the elderly can give the data needed about the old days. For example, it is often the oldest community members who know the past more than the others as they may have been alive when some historic events really happened.

In conclusion, many reasons can make people more eager to know about their houses' past. Such knowledge can be obtained from different resources such as the town’s local library, online websites and the old aged memory.",7,7.0
"some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","It is true that a building with the dominant purpose of being a shelter hides its aesthetic and cultural values. Nevertheless, there is a progressively increasing number of residents who get more involved in studying the history of the place where they live in. Safety and interest are considered the main reasons for this trend.

Improved living standard has led humans to be more conscious about their lives in general, safety in particular. Like food intake and healthcare, they care about their accommodation. To be more specific, they are curious if their buildings are well constructed or not or when they were built. It is no exaggeration to say that a rundown apartment being built 50 years ago is not a preferable choice. By researching the house or the flat they are living, people likely are able to reduce the risks of unsafety. Another reason is perhaps their hobby. Living in fast-paced life with a myriad of stress, taking up a hobby is not a bad way. In this case, what these people are doing is somehow like an explorer discovering the past and this brings them contentment and joyness.

To know about the past of a building or an apartment, asking nearby neighbours, not least the elderly may be the most feasible method. These local residents are witnesses themselves who then become storytellers. Another plausible way is that they could facilitate the local library where regional-related articles are kept. To some extent, they might be lucky to find some piles of paper mentioning the construction site such as the conductor's name and construction time. These are obviously invaluable clues for them to find out more about the building's past. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that more people become more enthusiastic to study about their house's history because of their own safety and interests. Several methods could be helpful for their research.",9,8.0
Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is considered by some that playing computer games damages children, while others think it develops children’s potential in different aspects. In my opinion, I believe that computer games could have some advantages for children in their development, while playing them  constantly could have dangerous results. 

On the one hand, many think that playing computer games develops a child’s skills. In other words, by playing computer games, children could learn to make quick decisions in critical situations, which is important in their future lives. Furthermore, they could concentrate on one goal and be engaged in one activity for a long period of time. 

On the other hand, children who are involved in computer games for a long period could face damaged results on their health. It is proven that computer games have addictive effects on human minds. Obviously, uncontrolled children do not notice the influence of computer games on their soft minds. As a result, children become absorbed by virtual reality. 

Finally, in my opinion, whether playing computer games could be useful for children’s development at some points, depends on the period of time children are engaged in it. By spending too much time with computer games, children could lose the opportunities to be developed in different fields. Take for example socializing, by playing computer games, children do not communicate with their peers at all. Computer games cause addiction in child’s psyches if these activities are out of adults’ control. 

In conclusion, playing computer games could cause a positive effect on children’s development depending on the time children spend playing them. Parents should be aware of the time limits their children spend doing such kinds of activities.",5,6.0
"some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The need for human relationships has changed over time.Some people think that we are becoming more dependant on each other, While others believe that mankind has become more independent. The essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail.

A human being is social animals and they have a constant need to be in touch with someone of their kind. We have started relying on each other in various aspect of life whether it's networking for a better opportunity , career growth or merely for speaking our heart out. For example, One of my friends received a promotion within the first year of the job as she was really good with interacting with others which made her aware of possible opportunities which in turn helped her in a career move. On the other hand, remember the time when you were too stressed, the thing that you wanted to do is call up your mom, friend or your huslabel. Just the fact that there is someone who will listen to you gives the peace. We have built our lives based on these encounters that's why we will always be dependent on each other.

As they say it, We are in the digital age and every need of ours can be fulfilled with just a click of a button and believe me so has the need to interact with other people. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have changed our world as never before. For instance previously if you were too lazy to move to switch off light, you would someone crossing to do the task for you but  now we have Alexa who does the task  plus entertains you with music, news and converses with you and we fall in love with her. It was so beautifully showcased in the movie Her. Another reason we have become self-sufficient is to be able to survive the competition and to achieve success. I myself have lived in five states all by myself in search of a better career opportunity which teaches you to be self-reliant. In simple terms technology and need for growth has made us independent.

To conclude, Being social animals there will always be a need for other people and because of technology,we have become independent. In my view,we are still relying on people in our toughest time even if we have become self-supporting.",7,7.0
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the cause of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","The high quantity of vehicle makes heavy traffic in several big cities and there are a few causes that led to this mess. Some actions can be done to tackle this chaos caused by high volume.

In busy hours, most people will stuck in heavy traffic and end up to spent more times than normal traffic. In fact, this catastrophe happens because lack of adequate public transportation. Citizens often confused how to commute and they think that by using current public transportation, they still need to walk more than five kilometers to finally find a bus stop. Apparently, they find it ineffective and prefer to own car or motorcycle, so they can minimize the count of their step. Moreover, a car usually only have a passenger, which if every person drives a car then imagine how many car will be on the main street after working hour.

Certainly, all this problem can be solved by investing on proper public transportation. Even though the construction will take a few years, all of this will be worth and the traffic jump can be reduced gradually. Also, the government need to acknowledge and encourage everyone to choose local train or bus to commute instead of buying a new vehicle, for the sake of citizens' convenient. By doing so, people will spend less time on driving and eventually saving their energy to study or work.

To sum up, the causes of high volume of traffic is due to inadequate transportation facilities. However, the solution to all of this trouble is to insist the government in brainstorming the mastermind plan of public transportation and fasten the construction, so it can prevent everyone from being stuck on the high volume traffic.",3,5.0
Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The population of our planet has been growing at a fast pace and thus meeting the demand for goods has become a tough achievement.
Some people, in order to face this issue, assume that every country should aim at producing more materials and goods.
I do not concur with this statement.
Rather than increase the production of goods and materials, a country ought to sensibilize its citizens not to dismiss goods that are still able to function properly.
Getting rid of goods that still work just because the new one has been released forces every country to produce more and more good, leading to a worsening of our enviroment.
Another pivotal factor that I would like to underline is the fact that people from developed countries do not have a shortage of goods. Not at all.
Consumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions.
Most of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement. I firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars.
In my opinion, the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that I have briefly mentioned before: a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people suggest that adolescents should do volunteer community work during their leisure time as it may be beneficial to them and society as well. I tend to agree with this statement, as in my view the best way to develop the sense of community among teenagers is to give them the opportunity to observe others reality practically. Furthermore, the community would be benefited from new ideas or projects from the teenagers.

To begin with, adolescents usually learn from the environment that they live and neighbourhoods works may help younger people to receive the greatest work experience from building at least a sense of community and empathy to others. Because  they will have the opportunity to observe  others reality from a practical and different perspective. Moreover, as the teenagers are doing unpaid work, they probably will not have time to spend with the wrong crowd. For instance, in the neighbourhood where I grew up many of my friends change their behaviour after community work as they could see the consequences of alcohol and drugs.

Furthermore, not only the teenagers would have gained from community work, but the community as well. Once the adolescents could bring ideas or create new projects with subjects that they have learned from schools, such as ecological ideas, musical class or even finance management. It certainly would help the community and adolescents development. In addition, children and adolescents who live in the community where the work is carried will have an example to be inspired, a person who in the majority of time achieved success through work and study.

To sum up, charity through unpaid work is one of the best ways to develop the community and adolescents as both of them can learn from each other. Adolescents can develop their sense of community and empathy and the community can be benefited from the help they received.",9,8.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the modern life, teenagers have difficulty to choose between finding a job and attending the university or college. Although, there are many advantages of working after high school, I believe that continuing the college or university is the better option for students. 

There are several reasons people choose finding job is the better choice. Firstly, after completing the high school, teenagers are enough 18 years old, they are able to earn money on their own and be independent without parent’s financial supports. In fact, many students in Europe tend to find a job after high school. Secondly, the teenagers have a thought that studying at the university or college is not crucial for them, so they want to get a job or start up with their own career. For example, Bill Gate or Mark Zuckerberg has not graduated any university or college, however, they are owning many giant companies over the world. 

On the other hand, I strongly believe that students would gain more advantages if students keep their studying. In fact, doctors, teachers, …  are not allowed to work in the hospitals, school if they do not have the high academic qualifications. Besides, for many high-paying jobs always need vital requirements. Job market is more competitive and a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in your resumé can be a huge advantage compared to other applicants. Employers would prefer a person who has an adequate amount of knowledge to work efficiently with less training time.  

It seems to me that students with higher academic background are likely to be more successful in pursuing their dream jobs.",3,5.0
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from
competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers influenced
by advertisements. What measures can be taken to protect them?","The aim of advertisements is to show what is necessary to buy and to create variety with new products. In daily life, we have seen many of it which affect our minds. In recent years, advertisements have shown us via social media so shall we restrict it or how can we utilize it without affected by it? 

Firstly, Social media is likely a channel. Many people in the world are using it. Users are mostly searching for something which can relative with their minds in these moments and web searches save by artificial intelligence. Depending on your search, artificial intelligence works as a sales consultant who can canalize you to relative advertisements. Moreover, It is a kind of open market which is at your home and knows you. To avoid it we should be conscious consumers.

Nowadays, depends on industrial improvements, lots of companies and products are emerging. So day by day, advertisements have been more important to sell a product. That occurs the big rivalry between the companies which can disturb consumers, The consumers can avoid it. They should know what they should buy. The decision is crucial because even if just one product can be produced from various brands. For example, if you want to buy a can of milk, you will see lots of types of milk and it will not be easy to buy one of them and also in this process, you will be lost time when you look for which one is able to you.

Companies and their racings have affected all consumers via advertisements and a variety of their products. Frankly saying, preparing shopping lists, consciously shopping, avoiding unnecessary buying will save money and time.",6,6.5
Many students find it harder to study when they are at university or college than when they were at school. Why is this? What can be done to solve the problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, there are many students who are at university or college find difficult to learn than when they studied at school. This essay will explore some reasons behind this phenomenon befor suggesting some solutions to tackle this issue. 

There are several reasons that make students find harder when studying at university or college. Firstly, the transition to higher level education is difficult for students to follow. The curriculum at university or college requires more concentration and self-study than which they studied at school. The reason is given that when they studied at school, their old teachers might give them different examples and exercises in each lessons. Thanks to that, student when studied at school could understand the knowledge more effectively and easier. In contrast, when they continue to study at university or college, most of students have to look up information about the lecture in the Internet or in specialized books by themselves to do complex reseach projects with minimal guidance from their teachers. Secondly, students are often facing up with many classes with large number of students. These classes can make some students find harder to connect with their professors. As the result, the individualized support may decrease. This is also very different from what they received from their old teachers at school. Due to the smaller class size, old teachers could focus on all students, so they could know each student's weaknesses and strengths to help them improve their strengths and fix their weaknesses. 

To address these challenges, students should be more proactive in their leaning processes. For example, when the students have questions about the lecture, they should meet their professors to ask them their questions after the class ended. Most of professors may spend little of their time to answer student's questions. By this way, many students can understand deeper about the lecture. Moreover, universities and colleges should divide classes into different smaller classes. Thanks to this solution, professors can focus more on their students and enhance the quality of the lecture. 

In conclusion, the transition from school to university or college can bring several challenges for many students due to the requirement of concentration and self-study and the lack of individualized support. However, by the proactive of students and smaller classes can solve these issues.",1,4.0
"Some people say that to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Certain concerned parties today contend that the optimal means of improving public health is to confront pressing environmental and housing problems. In my opinion, though these solutions would be helpful, it is more important to prioritize proper nutrition.

On the one hand, there are current issues concerning housing and the environment that impact health. Many illnesses and conditions are either directly or indirectly related to one’s environment. For instance, a person who lives in an overcrowded metropolis such as Hanoi or Beijing must deal on a daily basis with the immediate dangers of air pollution, potential drinking water contamination, car accidents, and elevated crimes rates. If there were fewer individuals in these cities and the air was cleaner because there were more open, green areas, then it is probable that hospitals would be able to focus more on a reduced number of patients.

On the other hand, there are various causes for diseases and the primary one is poor nutrition. In the last several decades, lifespans globally have increased exponentially, largely as a result of advances in medical science and greater understanding of the human body. A standout example of this would be the plant-based diets that are widely recommended by most nutritionists. A person who consumes little meat, reduces their carbohydrate intake, and mostly does not eat sugar will drastically lower the risk of conditions ranging from diabetes and heart disease to Alzheimer’s and cancer. National health authorities can widely and effectively address these health problems by legislating the levels of unhealthy ingredients in food products.

In conclusion, those in favor of combatting housing and environmental problems make legitimate arguments though improving the average citizen’s diet is in fact the best guarantee of good health. Naturally, governments should pursue a balanced policy.",7,7.0
Some people think that robots are importanat for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is considered by many that robots play a significant role in the growth of mankind, while others believe that it has an adverse impact on the community. Although technological advancement can aid in accomplishing tasks that humans cannot do, I think that it will give rise to theunemployment.

On the one hand, machines have the ability to go beyond the radar of where humans can reach. This comprises some challenging sectors like mining or working in countries with harsh weather conditions. Furthermore, the usage of machines can mitigate any kind of the risks involved with the human body. Moreover, artificial intelligence can help to detect information at a high pace compared to the human brain. For example, many low-wage workers from Nepal who work in the Middle East countries lose their lives due to extreme weather or falling off from a height. Hence, to  safeguard the lives of people, robots can be an alternative.

On the other hand, robots, if offered as an alternative, will take away the jobs of the public. Due to extensive technological upgrades, not only the white-collar employees, but all kinds of workers fear losing their income. For example, Naulo, a Nepali restaurant, has robotic waiters. This influenced other restaurant owners too as it attracts customers. As a result, waiters protested against all this strategy. Henceforth, technology serves as a bane to the citizens.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Due to the expansion of consumer goods , it is showing negative impact on nature. There are many reasons behind this harm, in this esssay we will discuss those reasons and prospective solutions for that.
                                Consumer goods are those products which are available for ready to use to consumer. The product can be used for a minute to long time. In present senario when modern technology is devloping very fast, customers are provided with a vast range of consumer goods. In way to satisfy the risen demand from consumer side,there is mass exploitatin of natural resources from producer site. There are many things like plastic , harmful metals and other packaging materials are used in these factories. The factories are also harming the environment by adding polluted water, dangerous gases and hazardus waste to surroundings.
                            Due to mass production we are damaging our environment, resulting in air, water and soil pollution.
Production of the goods can not be stopped suddenly but we can restrict it. Fot this government can make policies which keep eyes on producer of the goods. Awareness programme amoung public and industrialist should be run to make them educate about side effects of this kind of growth. Consumer should be informed in details about the damage which is caused by a single consumer product to nature, so they can also minimize their demand or avoid the demand of products which are not necessory.
                          Every development comes with it's pros and cons, so we can not stop moderisation but we can make peace between development and environment. Any kind of goods can be replaced but not the environment.Ultimately the environment is priceless. So we all make hand together to save the nature.",1,4.0
Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some people believe that they should take steps to battle againt climate change, however, others arhue that it is not their matter of concern and should leave as it is. I advocate that small changes in human activities can save the earth from the bad energies of global warming. In this essay, I will discuss both views by analyzing how collective human attempt can make big alter, even though climate change is a natural process.

On the one hand, lathough differ in environmental weather making life difficult and harm in different ways, few thing that it is out of control and can not make any progress. As a result, many creatures are in endanger stage. Furthermore, it is a part of natural transformation and probably not changeable. such as volcano, tsunami, earthquake these are a form of natural calamities and happens as a part of its progression not because of human activities, so it should left as it is.

On the otherhand, many argue that this is an effect of luxurious standard of living and if the way of living style is changed, it can be minimized up to some extent. Man can contribute their interest by requesting the government to make certain strong rules and regulate them accordingly, support scientists and encourage them to research more on how to reduce the consequences of global warming, and technologists to invent new technology. Which can stop the bad effect at the atmosphere. Thus, population of earth should take part in saving earth from environmental imbalance. The Tesla car can be taken as a sample, which is run by batteries that do not emit carbon gas.

In conclusion, although the actions of mankind discharge little or no carbon gas in comparation to what amount natural disasters emit, it can be managed by human power since they are able to think innovatively and invent new technology that could lessen the impact.",6,6.5

Discuss both views and give your opinion","When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, i would argue that it is better to go college or university
  The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, learning skills which are necessary for your future career such as team working,problems solving,etc could be a good chance to be well-prepared and get a well-paid job. For example, applicants who have a real experiences which are only gained from working will be more impressive with employer in interviews. Secondly, it is undeniable that start earning money when you work straight after high school could help you to become independent with financial problems in future. For instance, the income that you accumulate every year from your job might increase to a numerous money if you make a good plan and the result is you could be comfortable in your spending. 
        On the other hand, i believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Furthemore, the job market in recent years is very competitive and academic qualifications are a good way to help you become prominent. As an illustration, some diplomas that you gain from higer level education such as master, doctor, etc are the compulsory codition to get a job in many speicial organizations like Ministry of Finance, Central Bank. What is more, knowledge which you obtain from university or college are the optimal way to broaden your horizon. A case in point, microorganism is a special feild so that most precious universities could be suitable places if you want to explore this feild.

Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages,"In the present day, people tend to use social media in order to stay updated with the world as well as with their loved ones. One of the main advantages of using social news is you can post anything freely whether it's some sort of news or images, whereas social media has a negative impact on our life as well. People can scam you or use your personal data.

To begin, using social publishing has many advantages because it is the source of conveying messages to your loved ones and it provides us with different platforms to stay aware of everything that happened in any corner of the world. For instance, in 2019, news of Coronavirus that  originated from china spread all over the universe through social media apps. Thus, the other countries kept precautionary measures at that time to prevent themselves from the virus.

On the other hand, social radio apps has also negative influence on human life because there are people who hack public accounts and blackmailed them to meet their demands. Therefore, in this , sense social television has disadvantages too. For example, nowadays a group is active on social media that is hacking accounts of political leaders of many countries like the USA and Pakistan.

In a nutshell, it is clear that there is more benefit to using social media as compared disadvantages. So, the disadvantages are outweighed by the interest.",5,6.0

what are the reasons for this?

how can people  research this?","It is dominant that numerous people have a profound curious toward revealing their historical roots and chronological orders. Exploring the aborigine of their amenities is considered the robust evident for their intrigues. This essay will come up with the plausible reasons for that case, along with the potential method that has used for searching.

To commence, the reasons of looking for the history of estates are various. However, the most compelling cause is that belonging to  valuable places, rendering individual  a sense of pride in that places. When dwellers live in houses that have a particular series of historical circumstances, owned to a brilliant character that had played a great role in the past, they will appreciate the value of those places and foster their sense of belonging. For example, Purchasing mansions are linked with historical features, is the most trigger for some dignitaries. Therefore, the government occasionally offers the properties of previous artists, politicals and other prominent characters for auction with relatively expensive prices and may cost a fortune. 

Furthermore, inhabitants can adopt an erray of searching methods. Initially, they can embark with reading and watching documentaries related to the ancestors of the districts. If the place has a puplic historical origin, they can brows the interent. Because of Acquiring information by using the internet, has become more readliy. Another official way, is some concerned associations in the government sector, For instance, the Ministry of Archaeology can contribute with a broad range of information in that regard. Those are the most feasible ways to the effective searching.

Accordingly, searching  for the history can depend on different ways, such as reading documentaries, browsing interent and getting support from gorvernment bodies to abundant information.",6,6.5
"Many jobs used to be done at home by hands but nowadays, increasing number of them are done by machines instead. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of this.","With mechanization, machines have become an extension of our everyday life. In earlier days, many household chores were done manually ,however, nowadays population rely heavily on the gadget  to complete different home jobs. This essay will discuss the merits and demerits of using machines in our daily life.

First and foremost, with the discovery of electric machines, much of the housework has become easier to carry out. A number of tedious household chores that required a great deal of human effort have now become a piece of cake. For instance, washing clothes by hand and cleaning the house using a broom is now replaced by washing machines and house cleaning robot machines. Furthermore, another benefit of using electrical appliances at home is that it saves time. As machines can assist in completing multiple tasks simultaneously, most of the work around the house can be finished quickly. For example, previously chopping vegetables, grinding ingredients for food were time-consuming feats because they were done manually. Nowadays, with food processors and blenders, this can be done by just flicking a switch.

However, the advent of machines in housework has its drawbacks. Electronic appliances have made humans complacent and lazy. As machines took over manual work, people are relying heavily on electronics to do even small jobs that don't require much labour.There is an advanced refrigerator now available in the market which will notify the user when the items inside are running out. This feels like an unnecessary thing as people can easily know the items to be purchased by simply opening the refrigerator. Secondly, as machines became common more people are susceptible to diseases like bodily issues, diabetes because of inactivity. Previously manual jobs made people stay in shape and healthy as it required physical effort but because of ,machines humans are becoming unfit.

In conclusion, even though machines have made our life easier and save our time it has made us inactive and victims of many diseases.",7,7.0
Some people think that robots are very important to human’s future development. Others think that they are dangerous and have negative effects on society. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.,"There has been a debate between two groups of individuals, wherein one believes that machines are very crucial to people's future growth, the other contends that they are perilous and have false impacts on the nation. Which one of the ideologies is worth supporting- is the question? This essay not only intends to discuss them both but also my opinion at the end.

The conspicuous reason as to why a section of society holds a belief that robots play a pivotal role in human's life in future development is that machines always work quickly and accurately.To explain more, it is the myth that robots are  faster than individuals.Moreover, they always reliable and efficient.To exemplify, a survey conducted by research centre that 80 per cent growth of the companies has increased due to the fact of robots.It aids to escalate the growth of the industries.

However, opponents have  conflicting views as they are dangerous and have negative impacts on  society.Moreover, due to this fact humans could lose their jobs.To explain more, if robots will replace  individuals then it would be difficult to survive for the latter on the earth.They will jobless and could not earn the money for their family.For instance, according to 'The Hindu' newspaper 70 per cent of people are unemployed in our nation the reason behind is robots.

Apart from this, it could be the chance of an accident.As machines are very heavy, sometimes we heard that 10 labour had injured because of the heavy equipment.

To conclude, although both  groups have their conflicting views, I am in favour of those who opine that robots are perilous for  human's life and also it has detrimental effects on  society.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Nowadays, most people think that children should be punished when they commit crimes, while others believe parents should be punished rather than their kids. In this essay, I will discuss the both sides and will favor with the latter view. 

On the one hand, people suggest that offspring should be punished due to their bad behaviors. In this way, they don’t repeat their negative actions. For instance, when a child commits a crime such as a fighting with peers, parents can give a punishment to their kid, including a restriction of video games and meeting with peers. When children get these types of penalties, they can understand that their behavior was wrong, resulting in they tend to leave these acts behind them. Also, little ones can learn their every negative act has some consequences. 

On the other hand, some people believe that parents should get penalties due to be a role model of their kids. The children spend most of their time with their family members since they born, and their parents become main characters in their life. Therefore, kids tend to imitate their father and mother in terms of their behaviors and moral values. For example, if little one sees that his/her dad scream when arguing with other people, they perceive this act as a normal, resulting in copy this behavior. 

In conclusion, although some people claim that children should get penalty because of committing crimes, I believe that parents have a majority of responsibility on their kids’ acts due to be a role model in their offspring life.",5,6.0

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a common belief among certain individuals that teenagers should be mandated to contribute to their community with free service. This essay completely agrees with this statement and explains how both young adults and residents are benefited from such an arrangement.

Firstly, selfless community service allows young students to be prepared and excel in their adult years because it builds their personality to be altruistic. This is because sacrificing your own time and making significant efforts for others are two of the most important qualities demanded by a leadership position. For example, one study conducted by Forbes magazine concluded that about 80 percent of CEOs have served at least 160 hours for the betterment of society. Thus, helping the needy in early childhood benefits young people by enhancing their leadership traits.

Secondly, locals are benefitted due to the amazing contributions of a vibrant and dynamic workforce and free help. Since teens are physically more active, they can better take care of physically demanding tasks such as lifting weights, enduring long hours of work, and helping the elderly to walk around. Moreover, some local institutions, which can not afford to hire more people, can take advantage of these energetic individuals because of the unpaid job that they are doing. For instance, my local elderly care home has 90% of teenagers, who are studying in nearby schools, as employees. 

In conclusion, some people think that extracurricular volunteering activities should be compulsory for teenagers. In my opinion, it should be mandatory as it not only benefits teenagers' persona but also provides society with an incomparable and very economical workforce.",8,7.5
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Environmental pollution has been a major concern to the society. Some folks argue that increasing the oil price is not the best solution to mitigate the environmental issue.  I on the other hand agree with the notion above that increasing the cost of petrol decreases the frequency of its usage thus contributing to environmental advantage. 

Firstly, increasing the costs of fuel is one way to combat pollution. This is because, by inflating fuel prices, people will hesitate to spend their money on gas when they can spend their money elsewhere. For example, in Australia, people will not fill the tank of their vehicles on any other day other than Tuesday as the price of petrol is highly expensive. They need to fill up their vehicle with petrol, but are forced to wait until Tuesday just to fill up their vehicle tank when the petrol price is relatively cheaper. Moreover, they will start exploring other modes of transportation such as buses and trains since the fares are cheaper than their spending on petrol.  

Secondly, increasing the costs of fuel will directly affect the demand for fuel-based cars on the market. As a result of the rise in oil prices, there is less demand on the market for a vehicle that operates on petrol and diesel. It will further encourage people to explore other transportation that uses alternative energy for example electric or hybrid vehicles. For instance, a big brand like Toyota has started to produce more hybrid and electric automobiles as there is more demand for these types of vehicles in the market from consumers. 

In conclusion, I completely agree with the statement above as increasing fuel will be beneficial towards the environment since it will encourage the community to be vigilant in their fuel spending and  forced to consider alternative options such as using vehicles that source from renewable energy.",7,7.0
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In academic groups, some people believe that economic increase will not make that country's citizens happier. But there are people that oppose this idea because they agree that in this case, those people's level of life will increase, too. Moreover, wealthy countries will be able to have a bigger contribution to medicine, technology, space and other important fields for the human species. Due to these reasons, I completely oppose this idea. 

First and foremost, the level of life of citizens will increase and more workplaces will appear. This means that number of unemployed people will decrease. Also, the average amount of salary will increase. As an example, in wealthy countries such as the USA, UAE people earn much more money compared to not developed and poor countries such as Chad, Syria and etc. Therefore, it will be able easier for people to realize their ideas, or just travel or buy a house without any mortgage. They will able to study in  universities without any student loan which is quite popular among American students. 

Secondly, countries will be able to invest more money in science, medicine, technology and other areas which need development. Thanks to the investments scientists will be able to find cures for lots of diseases. Also, they will be able to improve technology to make people's life much more easier and productive. And one of the most important fields for surviving the human species is space. People will be able to colonize other planets, too. 

To sum up, economic increase for developed countries will have an impact on every country on Earth because of the technological, space, and medical development. Those developments will help everyone on Earth. But also, I would like to mention that citizens of wealthy countries will be happier.",5,6.0
Some people think that robots are important for humanʼs future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The first group of people believes that robots positively impact on world’s evolution. Others claim that these “mechanical creatures” can lead to unfavourable consequences. In my opinion, robots’ effect has more advantages than disadvantages.

In fact, robots are used in many spheres of our life. For instance, doctors provide difficult surgeries using special machines which can give patients a second life. Moreover, robots can create  prosthetics for people with disabilities. Consequently, such a person can feel equal to others. Actually, many people may not realize that robots are a part of our daily lives. For example, there are machines particularly in every company, for instance, in car manufacturers, electronic chains and even in the film industry. They help to develop society in different ways.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to the implementation of robots in certain areas of life. Firstly, it affects students’ development and education process in a negative way. For example, with the introduction of chat GPT, many teenagers began to use its functions in order to create a presentation, search for some information or do their homework without any attempts to think by themselves. Thus, adolescents become irresponsible and lazy. One more significant downside is that humans may lose their jobs because of replacing them with robots and this can become the cause of unemployment. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that robots are the progressive mechanism of  humanity and machines make people's lives much easier. In addition,  artificial intelligence can not only do the job for people but also develop their important work skills and imagination. Furthermore, robots will never be able to fully replace humans.",7,7.0
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that art education can play a vital role in the overall development of a child. Although some believe that including this including art in their curriculum is not worth their time, I would argue that it is a necessary subject that enhances their learning experience.

On the one hand, those who believe studying art is time consuming and worthless might argue that it does not lead to a successful career. This is because many artists struggle to make a living. For instance, a painter may have trouble selling a single piece of his art. By contrast, if the same time is utilized for learning other more important subjects such as science or business at school, it is likely that it will result in a fruitful profession like medicine, engineering, law or architecture.

On the other hand, my view is that it is very important to teach art at this stage because it imparts different life skills. The reason for this is that by practicing arts children can develop skills like patience, improved motor ability, better hand-eye co-ordination, creativity and many more. By completing a project and observing the rewards of hard work they build perseverance and unique way of thinking abilities, for example. Hence, if these skills are not taught at school, it may hinder the overall development of children.

In conclusion, while it is true that teaching art at school may seem to be a worthless and time consuming pursuit, it is my firm belief that the time spent on it will definitely foster life skills crucial for success in future.",8,7.5
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, pupils are acquiring a knowledge in the single-sex schools which were selected by their parents, and it is claimed that it will have drawbacks in their future life. I partially agree with this notion. In the following paragraphs I shall put forth my argument to support my point of view.
          Firstly, due to less communication with the opposite gender anyone will sense a discomfort and also one’s professional life affected badly. In other words, pupils, who went to only single-gender schools grew up shy and weak. For instance, personality who wants to get a job should pass a conversation in which checks ability to capable of performing under cruel circumstances. Hence, if this is a graduate of the single-sex school, the individual does not  have a challenging work. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institute have proven to perform excellently under any critical situation.
          On the other hand, co-educational institutions have a badly discipline issue, which interfere of their studies with allowing various  contradictions. However, separated gender schools can avoid from these problems and as a result, everyone would completely focus on their lessons. To put it simply, it is proved that almost all of the graduates who gain an education in single-sex high schools have more ability to concentrate comparing with conventional institutes. Therefore, this type of schools does not waste special time and improves attention skills.
          To sum up, I believe that young generations who were not attending co-ed schools are not able to successfully and develop professionally.",8,7.5
It is the responsibility of schools to teach children good behavior in addition to provide formal education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"No one doubts that school learning plays a significant role in people’s life. People who receive better education and behave themselves properly in society are highly appreciated and recognized. Some people argue that schools should be responsible not only for the decent behaviors of children but also for providing academic study. In the following paragraphs I will discuss this statement from my perspective.

 

There is some truth in the above statement. Academic organizations are places where kids are taught useful and valuable knowledge, in the meantime, how to behave properly is also one important part of their duties. However, their main task is to give formal schooling and develop children’s academic capability, because they have the most decent amount of resources to achieve this goal. For instance, professionally trained teachers and libraries with thousand copies of academic reference books enable them to become ideal providers of various knowledge. If they spend too much time on teaching students how to behave in their everyday lives, it will be impossible for it to fulfil the educational function as a whole, to make it worse, their valuable resources will be wasted.

 

Family plays a significant role in people’s lives. That is the very first step in the cultivation of a person’s moral standard and social behavior. Parents are the first teachers of their offspring.The reason is quite obvious that kids spend at least five to six years at home with their parents or caregivers before they go for formal learning in schools. Therefore, parents shall set good examples and teach some social rules and moral criteria in order to get their boys and girls ready for the studying environment.

 

In conclusion, schools shall put more emphasis on imparting academic knowledge instead of teaching kids how to behave properly during their growing into adults.",2,4.5
Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people ‘s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both view and give you own opinion.,It is the theme of lots of discussions if climate or the economy has a crucial impact on people's lifestyles. I think both views are reasonable but I believe that economically strong countries have better living conditions despite the severe climate and in the following paragraphs I will further my point of view.,0,<4
"Task 2: Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Recently, the debate on whether studying at a tertiary institution or getting a job straight after school can lead to a successful career. Since the ideal career for everyone is not the same, the way they need to achieve it can also vary. This essay will examine this point. 

To begin with, those who claim that accomplishing a degree in university or college can be benefit future career may consider academic performance as the major factor. For example, jobs like professor required a lot of specific knowledge where most of which can be acquired in college. Therefore, for people who are interested in careers with low occupational mobility, having at least a bachelor degree or even a master degree can help them to secure a place when they are applying. 

In contrast, experiences may be more important than theories for some other job, which are supported by the argument that working right after secondary education will be more beneficial. To illustrate this, jobs like catering and drivers, instead of having a lot of relevant concepts, practice can indeed lead to perfect due to the monotonous character of the work. In this way, the workers who have longer working period may be considered as having a greater competitive edge. 

In conclusion, it is undeniable that both having higher education background or start working at a young age may lead to a different life path. However, it can be hard to draw a conclusion on which route can lead to a more successful future as people may have different ideal jobs and have various understanding toward 'successful'.",10,8.5
"Write about the following topic.Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The essay below is a discussion on a common topic that arises often between people who live in big cities and those who stay in rural areas or rather small towns. Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?
Firstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.
Traffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.
However, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.
In my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that? We have people in the less populated areas who are unwell or obese while we have those living in big towns and are in great physical and mental shape.",5,6.0
"Directors of large organizations earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others hold that it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","Pay disparity is a growing concern in many large organizations all over the world. While some people support the idea that top-tier officials should earn higher salaries than other employees, others are against this notion. Both views will be discussed in this essay, though I personally feel that the directors of these companies should be paid higher salaries.

Many people think it is unjustifiable to pay managers a wage that is 10 times more than an employee earning the lowest salary in the company. The reason behind this thought is the member's mindset. They believe that the salary paid should be based on the employee's contribution to the growth of the company and not the position of the worker. They argue that a regular employee works much harder and even does extra hours and hence contributes more than the higher authorities towards the success of the organization. This discretion in salary creates low work loyalty and poor motivation among the staff.

However, these people do not understand that salary is not directly proportional to the amount of work done. The remuneration of the higher authorities is based on competition. The board members set a standard salary for executives on the basis of the carcity of competent managers. Moreover, the manager has a lot of responsibilities. Even though he is a manager, he still has to manage his team, manage different projects, make and submit reports to the higher-ups, etc. Therefore, is it justifiable to pay high compensation to the directors of such organizations.

In conclusion, every employee in a company feels that everyone should be equally paid. But in my opinion, the managers should be paid higher than the others for the proper functioning of the institution.",9,8.0
"Many jobs used to be done at home by hands but nowadays, increasing number of them are done by machines instead. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of this.","Due to the growth of technology, we got multitudinous facilities in our home, offices which makes our life comfortable and easy. In ancient time, people usually did numerous work at home with their hands but, in modern era, the development of various gadgets helps them to complete their household tasks without any complications. This essay will elaborate merits and demerits of this innovation.

                              Different kind of home equipment's are indispensable in today's life. First and foremost, people get huge time which they can invest on themselves. Earlier, masses spent their whole day in doing oodle of jobs at home but now, they can do everything with one click. In this way, they can spend their free time according to their own wish. For instance, in previous years, ladies washed clothes with their hands but nowadays, they have washing machines and they need to click just one button.

                     On the other side, this invention also have some disadvantages. Like people become lazy, that is the direct reason of many health problems such as obesity and many more. However,People fully depended on these sort of machines as well as they don't have single minute to do household chores which makes them lazy about duties. In this way, they caught by obesity because, they don't do any activity. In old times, people were more healthy and fit because, they did zillion home activities. 

                         To conclude, it is obvious that everything has two sides. But, I think, the cons can be overcome by its pros. If masses start to maintain balance with it, then they can easily avoid negative consequences of this invention and can enjoy its plus points.",5,6.0
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience","Climate concern has been major concern all over the world. People come to opinion that they need to live along the climate change instead of taking preventive steps.

I totally disagree with this. This essay will look into details
Major factor for climate change is global warming . Emission of many harmful gases into air can cause increase increase in the levels of co which is really harmful for human environment.

Which causes depletion of ozone layer . ozone layer protects earth from Uv Rays, hence in its absence sun rays directly reach skin causing many skin problems.

Another major issue would be melting of glaceirs causing increase of sea level . And in next years many coastal regions may submerge .

For example mount everst had reported many melting.

On other hand, Uneven rainfall can destroy many crops along with no rainfall lead to drought. Harmful waste released to river can evaporate and cause acid rains causing damage to

both mankind and animals. There is also change in season pattern like we are not intendedseasons.  Excessive floods can cause soil erosin taking away all fertile soilFor example hailstroms in winter can effect 

crops and cause loss.

"Many people argu that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.
Discuss both views and give your Opinion.","Nowadays, a powerful hierarchy exists in many education institutes. This situation is more common, especially, in undeveloped countries such as Turkey, Sierra Leone and Cambodia. One of the most distincitive implemetation which this education mindset brings is that the teachers know everything well. In other words, the students are forced to believe in teachers without asking any questions. When it is observed the developed countries such as Finland, Sweden and others, it is clear that the students are free in analysing information given by teachers. From my perspective, the reasonable method is that not only the education system provides theorical or practical information to the students, but also the students have a particular inspection capacity.

In regions that educaiton is implemented as based on teachers, it is almost impossible to emerge the new ideas. The main reason behind lies is that students' opinions over certain topic do not carry any importance. For example, given the research and development rates around the world, it is clear that the countries to embrace the comprehensive education system, which teachers and students produce the different sights, are ahead of other countries which they do not own. Another fact is that  the reciprocal interaction between teachers and students is to improve the social capabilities. Eventually, it is a well-known matter that an individual, who passed through an high quality education system which allowed to question the wondered points, have more emphaty channels.

On the other side, in geographical places which education has the strict discipline conditions, in general, it is not expected the students to criticize the teachers. What is more, as it is mentioned at topic, it is a pervasive belief that being lost the teacher's charism by students is perceived as the loss or state authority.

To recapitulate, education is not a military service which the hierarchy plays an important role, in contrast to this, education should carry the meaning that the students represent various views and solve many problems in the real world.",1,4.0
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In various countries around the world, more individuals prefer to become parents at elder age periods. While this can certainly offer an advantage, I believe that the drawbacks are of greater significance.

The benefit of having juveniles at old age is to give fathers the chance to become financially prepared for this challenge. It is mainly because raising a family and taking care of it require being settled with proper housing and fair salaries. This may take years after graduation to be accomplished. For example, in the country I was born, couples married after their forties due to the poor economical conditions of the citizens. Therefore, it could be an advantage not to have offspring without being ready for such responsibility. 

Conversely, there are many disadvantages that can result from raising youngsters at older ages. Firstly, the parent will be old when their minors are growing. Hence, an age barrier could prevent having a healthy relationship between guardians and their offspring. To give a clear example to this, a sixty years old father can hardly understand the mind of thirteen years teenager. In addition, fathers might be at critical ages and it is not convenient for them to take care of newborns. Whereas, younger fathers and mothers can easily stay awake all night or act more actively with their kids. Consequently, it is not preferred to have kids after the forties.

Another drawback is the fetal risk of giving birth to women after a certain life. Their bodies can be weaker and they might suffer many health issues during pregnancy. Therefore, it is extremely advisable for females to deliver before their thirties. 

To conclude, having children after certain ages might result in more stability. However, the cons of it are worth more considering because it can lead to fetal risks, besides, unmutual understanding between elder parents and their children.",8,7.5
People nowadays tend to have children at an older age. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In the present time, individuals are participating in a race to earn more and live an opulent luxury life. It is very common for couples to have children at an older age. This is because they devote the maximum part of their 20s and 30s to building a good career. They pay priority and attention to fulfilling objectives and goals first. While there are several advantages to this ongoing trend, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

Individuals have personal reasons to get babies when they are in their 30s or 40s. One of the prominent reasons behind this is achieving financial independence. Parenthood is related to several responsibilities. Since younger couples are unlikely to earn a handsome salary, they are not financially ready to welcome the new baby. Hence, they prefer having a child only when they are financially stable at a later stage of their life.

However, this ongoing trend has its disadvantages. The most prominent disadvantage is health problems. Giving birth to babies after the mid-30s can be troublesome. This is because the chance of fertility reduces in both men and women with the signs of ageing which ultimately leads to personal problems. Many couples who start a family at a later stage of life eventually decide to adopt due to infertility. Also, it can be seen in many cases that babies conceived at a later stage in life always come with genetic problems. Hence, having babies at an older age is somewhat risky. 

To conclude, in my opinion, demerits always outweigh the advantages of having a child at a later stage of life. The risk of health problems, personal problems, and infertility is very serious.",7,7.0
"Some people think technology makes life complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology.

Do you agree or disagree?","There is a drastic change in each and every field due to rapid advancement in technology. Some technology is difficult to undestand or it takes time to learn that technolgy but it does not mean than it increases the life dificulties. Nowdays, if you not follow the trend of technology than you would make your life complex rather than using it. So, I surely believe in that use of technology will ease the pressure of life living and my essay will give some examples of it.

Technology gave us more time to live in this world and to enhance the beauty of the nature. If we are using the fast car to reach the another destination is good way to reduce time and this only happens if we use new cars which has been made by new techology.  Another good exaple of how technical things that has been inveted by our scientis.

If we not adopted the technolgy than people would be not able to get fast transaction of banks.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after graduating from high school. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is argued that the best way to have a successful career is studying at a university or college, while others disagree and think that getting a job straight after the academy is better. This essay agrees that it is more important to continue to study than leave seminary early

There can be no doubt that you can gain more knowledge if you go to college and university, and after ,that you can get qualifications that have a lot of benefits for you in the future. Indeed, a well-paid job which needs qualifications can get very easily ,for example: a doctor, engineer, or scientist. Besides that, you could live in a new house and make new friends that you would have an improved social life while you are at university. Moreover, you will get more future employment opportunities.

Despite that, there is a small minority that suggests  leaving the academy at 18 and getting a job. This belief is based on you could cultivate relevant skills and gain more practical knowledge that would help you not to nose dive and become more mature and independent when you work in a company or operate a business. Furthermore, you can raise money early and be financially independent.

In conclusion, having a successful career requires a relevant background either in experience or education, depending on the type of work and field. People should ensure they attain the necessary skills or degrees to be sure of success",5,6.0
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Raising the price of petrol for vehicles and other transportation is one of the best ways for some people who believe that can solve 

environmental problems. I would like to share some of my opinions about it.

First of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems because nowadays there are too many cars running on the streets. Almost everyone has a car and does not like to use public transport because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro ,especially from a suburb. However, if the government can raise the price of petrol and make their transportation systems more friendly, it will make citizens and tourists use it generally due to the financial concerns.

Secondly, the government can make some packages for the public transportation to inspire people to take them instance of driving their own cars. For example, if people can get discount from taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. Besides, between different places, the governments can build systems for people to bike, if it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will be more and more popular for people to use it and make the environment friendly.

On the other hand, it is not only because  the cars produce too much carbonatite but also many other facts. Due to many studies, climate-changing 

 is cost by many different issues which include making products related to meat, factories, agriculture...etc. Therefore, all of the facts cost different levels of environmental problems and it 

all results in climate-change.

In conclusion, though there are many issues cost the environmental problem, I believe it will have a good result if the fuel price increase and everyone will definitely be concerned about the cost and make new methods to itface.",1,4.0
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"There is no doubt that various pupils are struggling in school to concentrate on their studies and it is commonly observed globally. In the following paragraphs, I would briefly discuss the main causes for this problem and would propose some solutions to address this sensitive issue. 

To begin with, there are a variety of problems associated with students decreasing attention span. Firstly, the excessive use of technology is harming their ability to focus. They find it difficult to stay in conventional classrooms without operating such devices. They develop discomfort and fail to attend the whole class with higher attention. Secondly, children have more workload these days like ,first they have their academic classes in school after then tutor sessions besides that some students also joined hobby classes like music lessons or sports activities. In order to attend all those activities, they miss their food or do not take proper nutritional food which negatively affects the physical as well as mental health of kids. 

However, these issues can be addressed effectively if certain steps are taken by parents and teachers. Parents should limit the time to use  technological devices such as iPad, computers and smartphones, which helps to avoid physical and psychological health issues. Besides that, parents, as well as teacher,teachers should teach kids some time management skills so that they can manage all those activities without any problem. Additionally, nutritional lessons should be arranged in the school setting for improving the awareness among children regarding the balance diet. 

To conclude, despite certain reasons for the lack of children’s attention in classes, parents and teachers can solve this problem if they take correct preventive steps.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robot.

What is your opinion?","The issue whether companies and markets have a liability to decrease a quantity of products, which need to be packed or purchaser should attempt buying goods without a lot of packaging is ambivalent. There are two different opinions, which have pros and cons and take place.

On the one hand, some people count, that manufacturers and markets have to avoid packing, because it can cause problems relate pollution. For instance, there are many plastic materials impact on environment. The nature tends to be demolished, due to a lack of influence on firms from governments. Waste which humanity obtain by a production of various items has a significant effect on an ecosystem. Thus, there is already an ordinary point of view, which come from conservation organizations such Green Peace, that an amount of such materials should be reduced and replaced.

On the other hand, there is an opposite worldview, that people should try to make a preference to products which do not have huge amount of packaging. For example, if a human will able to decline a quantity of waste materials, therefore a dominance of such items will go down. Than, it will be able to drop an economic system of many organizations that produce kind of things. Unfortunately, such path is unlikely, because in our world, there is a broad impact from such subjects. Nevertheless, each consumer individually has opportunity to maintain an environmental situation relates to a pollution.

In conclusion, I think that both of side have to decrease a number of packaging goods, but firstly it should be manufactures and markets which use kind of way. This issue can’t be resolved without actions from an initiator.",4,5.5
"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Today we live in the pandemia world, even if several countries don't have a high risk of infection for the majority of its population. We stiil sit at home rather then go to a restorant with friends and a lot of companies still keep their offices locked.
On the one hand office workers from all over the world opened the possibility of working from home. This option gives you more freedom and diversity of places from wich you can do your job: you can meet with your collegues from cafe or library, from kitchen or bedroom. Also, we were forced to keep our social nets with online tools, to communicate with our friends and families. Now we all learned to use such programmes like Zoom or Skype to speak with each other. Probably if we hadn't the Covid, we would struggle bigger difficulties when someone from our buddies would come to another country or town, but now we all know what to do with this, how to keep in touch. We also got to appreciate the power of touching more then before, because we were missing it for these long monthes. How it was nice to hug an old friend after long quarantine!
On the other hand we really weaned from normal offline communication. And we can't evaluate how many people started to think that online is absolute substitute of offline. It's obviosly not like that. During online meeting it's impossible to have a normal common discussion because it needs to have only one person speaking. Also people lack of possibility to see each others eyes, so they don't feel enough contact with each other.
As a conclusion it is possible to say that situation with increasing popularuty of online meetings is ambivalent. This type of communication save our connections with each other during the pandemia, but there is a risk of substitution real meetings by online in the situations when it is not appropriate. As far I am concerned, I think that advantages outweight disadvantages, but we need to use online communication properly.",5,6.0
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environment problems is to increase the cost of fuel. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The continuous burning of fossil fuels is the major contributor to the environmental problem plaguing mother earth over the last decade. Society feels that the best way to tackle this problem is to increase the cost of fuel. However, I feel that is not the only way to relieve this planet of this problem. I will substantiate my reasoning in the course of this essay.

	First and foremost, increasing fuel costs will create a change in the transportation sector. Many people will choose to take alternate mediums of transport. They will be encouraged to carpool, use public transport and even in the case of short-distance travel, walk or use a bicycle. However, there is still no guarantee for this. For example, in my hometown Trivandrum, the price is currently INR. 104/- per litre, and keeps rising every week. Considering, that travel by car and bike is the easiest mode of transportation because of the distance between the different requirements in the city, and the lack of a reliable public transport system, individuals are still forced to rely on their cars to move from place to place.

	Alternately, what the government needs to do, is to strengthen the public transport sectors, impose heavy fines on the number of vehicles a family can posse, and in addition, they must thrust onto the public fines for using vehicles after a certain hour. Furthermore, they should encourage local bicycle businesses, by creating more bicycle lanes and parks, which will in turn help to boost their business. Car manufacturers, must look into the possibility of producing greener cars, and slowly phase out the production of petrol and diesel vehicles. Once this happens, more and more petrol stations will cater to the new requirements by vehicle owners. These are some of the changes that the administration can enforce.

	In conclusion, I believe the increase in fuel price is not the only answer for this problem, but in fact, the government has to invest heavily in renewable forms of energy if any sustainable and lasting change needs to be made.",8,7.5
More and more people these days work harder and longer hours and have no time for family life and friends. What are the causes in your opinion for this? How is it affecting family life and the society as a whole?,"In bygone days, People used to spend their hours on family relationships. However, as time is changing so many changes in almost every field can be seen. These days, It is believed that in various nations communities are busy performing their official tasks. There are certain factors responsible for it. This essay will shed light on the reasons and discuss whether it is a beneficial or harmful development in the following paragraphs.

There are some factors associated with this issue. The first point of prime importance is financial needs which makes them work the whole day like a machine in order to meet their fundamental household needs. For instance, In countries like India, Inflation is sky-rocketing due to which prices of almost each and every commodity are increasing. Due to this, a huge amount of money is needed to survive in this competitive era. This caused myriad workers to do overtime to earn more.

Another major cause is the overloading of tasks. It is clearly visible in corporate sectors as well as in other jobs that employees are facing stress because of enormous duties. In Addition to it, targets given by the employers are needed to be completed in time. Therefore, to accomplish their target they spent long hours on office premises in order to attain that target on time.

Some considered this change a positive while others think it is  a negative development. According to my point of view, This affects the health of the working population. So, this should be implemented carefully otherwise it will make the situation very worst.

To conclude, I would like to state that there are both sides to the said question. However, if I consider it logically then I believe the latter view is more effective and powerful. So, I agree with it.",8,7.5
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people think minors working an unpaid part-time job for communities might have advantages for themselves and for the local residents. I personally agree how part-time jobs for youngsters will bring many benefits for their future, because they will learn how to manage their time for work and play

The main reason they will benefit from part-time jobs is that they will have hands-on experience, thus increasing their hard and soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and teamwork. Many youngsters and recent graduates, for example, struggle to find work due to a lack of work experience. They will have an early start in learning how the work field operates as a result of this. Another one is that they can help communities that are in need and grow connections. Working with the community that surrounds them will not only benefit the community but also themselves, because helping people will give us our own satisfaction and contribute to the country, starting with a smaller scope.

On the other hand, many adults are concerned that, because of their part-time jobs, teenagers will have less time to play with their friends in their spare time. But most importantly, it’s not about how the part-time job would take their time, but how teenagers will learn to manage their time so they can work and also live their lives as teens. A lot of part-time jobs are usually open around the summer, so they can divide their time more easily now that the school term is over.

To conclude, I fully agree with how the unpaid part-time job will give more advantages to minors and the community, as long as they can balance their work and play time with friends.",7,7.0
"Some people believe that children at school should learn art, others says it is a waste of time. What is your opinion?","Today's, music, dancing and painting fields are equally important as any other fields. Some believe that teenagers should learn art at an early age, while others would say that It is waste of time as well as money. This essay strongly agrees with Children should learn the art field because It increases their creativity and develops their minds. 

The primary reason students learn arts is that It improves their problem-solving skills. This is because If they learn painting and many more arts improve their mental abilities as well as develop their mind as well. For instance, a study conducted by American Management School found that around 60 per cent of teenagers who learn arts they are well performed in maths subjects because of their problem-solving abilities. 

Another reason is that they are more creative than any other children. Arts means creativity and if schools teach artists so, teenagers improve their creativity at an early stage. For example, an article published by BBC news showed that approximately 30 per cent of students learn arts at their starting days more creative than any others students. In addition, people encourage their children to become musicians and dancers.

In conclusion, mental development and more imagination and I, therefore, believe that students learn arts in their schools.",5,6.0
People nowadays tend to have children in older ages. do the advantages of this oyutweigh the disadvantages?,"In this fast-paced life, people prefer to have children later in their life. It has been argued by many whether this is a positive step or not. I, personally think it has more demerits as it increases stress and anxiety and also leads to many health problems. This essay will discuss both  sides and further state a strong reason why the negatives outweigh the positives.

On one hand, Due to excessive competition in the corporate sector, women tend to conceive later in their life. This could be because it brings financial stability and maturity to handle a baby with care. For example, a survey in the London time shows a considerable amount of females prefer to give birth when they are in their thirties. Therefore, it helps them to enjoy themselves before bringing a big responsibility to the world.

On the other hand, with the positives, one cannot neglect the negatives it offers. The first and foremost is the stress a lady has to go through when they have babies late. In other words, females tend to become weak after the age of thirty and suffer from different kinds of anxieties. For instance, in the United Kingdom, 90% of women suffer from psychological issues if they conceive after the required age. This further leads to many health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

In conclusion, it is inevitable to say there is no appropriate time to bring a soul into this world, but bringing them at a stake of hampering your health would be a wrong decision to make. I, strongly recommend the disadvantages overweigh the advantages as it could be harmful to the lady. Moreover, doctors are in favour of conceiving at the right age.",10,8.5
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger. What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?,"Growing population has become one of the significant issues globally as it can have both positive and negative consequences. In the recent trends, it is observed that in certain countries there is a hike in the count of children who are less than 16 year old. In this essay, I will analyze the feasible effects this growth can bring to the nation at present and future in terms of merits as well as demerits.

To begin with, the pattern observed has its own results in the present. On the positive side, as the number progresses to be high the government is enforced to provide better sanitation facilities for the kids, since the kids are more vulnerable to diseases. This will not only benefit the younger ones but also the adults by providing them with good medical facilities. However, looking at the other side, the public bodies will have to spend more on the resources such as food and education. This can cause a considerable amount of stress for them in terms of financial aspect, which can eventually lead to an increase in the tax collection that affects the public.

Moving further ahead and thinking about the consequences of the future, there will be a good revampment in terms of the nation's infrastructure development in numerous fields including internet, business and health. This is due to the fact that there will be a plethora of educated people with a specialization in a variety of fields. Contradictorily, the more number of educated youths can lead to an adverse situation namely unemployment. As the count of the competent persons in a domain is more, the most skillful ones will end up with a job. So the government needs to plan accordingly to provide employment to all the citizens.

To recapitulate, this essay deals with the various factors that can impact the nations where there is a constant improvement in the population.",3,5.0
Parents should encourage children spend less time on studying and more time on doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree?,"guardians have to uplift juveniles to utilise leisure point on academic study instead of spending more hour on sports activities, in my opinion, I agree with the given statement up to a great extent because with the aid of physical activity adolescence can learn new skills to survive in society, as well as a teenager, will develop their personality. however, the study is the key route for success in life

 To begin with, parents mein motivate their youngster to spend less moment on academic learning and inspire them about physical strength because Juvenile gain their weight due to sedentary lifestyle and less communicate  with folks that lead to  wheat well-being but with the help of sports activities adolescence can improve their interpersonal skill to survive in society moreover, physical activity provides an opportunity to juvenile and makes their body strong which allow children to do the task for a long period of time and benefit for their growth. for example: as per the survey of World fitness ,organisation those juveniles who have better energy  perform well in every task with the help of physical exercise 

on the contrary , the study is the basic need for juveniles and it is very necessary for the upcoming phase of life as well as with the help of education children are  able to learn the moral ethics of growth and enhance the knowledge as per the survey conducted by the education department in the Delhi adolescence chat list March who spend more time on cricket 

to conclude, education plays a vital role to get success in growth but I believe that spending more time on physical activity will police the skills of juvenile and least water good strength leads toward  a good fitness",6,6.5
"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. Do you agree or disagree?","Many argue that older family members should be taken care by younger family members and are responsible to support them mentally, physically and financially when they are unable to look after themselves. I believe that, it is everyone's responsibility to take care their parents or grandparents once they become older and cannot look after themselves but many fails to take that responsibility by their own due to the globalisation. 

Everyone agrees that after a certain ages our parents and grandparents become weak and less concious by physical, mentally and financially and it is our responsibility to look after themselves because they are unable to work and earn by their own. So younger family members should support and fullfil the need of their parents or grandparents whether it is about medication or other expenses. 

Moreover, in this fastest growing world, many younger people fails to look after their older family members because they travel all over the world due to business purpose and employment. Other than that, many of them do not have stability in their job or need to stay away from their families so it becomes quite tough for everyone to look the both things simultaneously. For that reasons, many younger people hire care takers for their older family members so that they can stay home safely under the observation of care takers even if their children stays far away from their home. 

To sum up this, people should understand their responsibility towards their older family members and support themselves in their crucial stage of life whether they live with their families or stay away from their them.",1,4.0
Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"In this day and age, human activities undoubtedly have detrimental impacts on organic life forms. While many people argue that any solution to tackle this dire problem is too late, others believe that the situation can still be improved by taking effective measures. In the following essay, I am going to discuss both sides of the argument and state my opinion. 

Many individuals think that any effort to solve the irreversible damage of human civilization on nature is overdue. This is due to the fact that this issue has lasted for several decades without any effective intervention. Simply put, over the course of history, civilizations have driven a large number of plants and animals to the verge of extinction for a host of reasons, whether to satisfy our personal gains such as collections or deforestation, or false rumours. For instance, during the past decade, a fabrication stating that rhino horns can cure almost every disease known to man, caused poachers to hunt down rhinos to collect their horns, meanwhile collectors would pay a fortune to gain access to these rumoured magical cures. Consequently, the number of rhinos drastically decreases, and despite any effort to preserve this endangered species, rhinos die out owing to the fact that the remaining specimens cannot mate and reproduce. Moreover, humans also cut down forests to make room for agriculture and construction sites, causing numerous species to lose their natural habitats. These are only a few examples of the harmful impacts of human activities on nature. 

On the other hand, many solutions can be utilized to improve the situation. First of all, technology has been innovated in our time, and many of these innovations have the potential to enhance the natural habitats of plants and animals. In today’s world, scientists have developed numerous ways to protect and preserve, as well as replicate endangered species in laboratories and provide necessities for their growth after releasing them into the wild. For example, an extinct herb has been recreated and nurtured in an ideal atmosphere, and researchers would take special care to guarantee its flourishment after planting them on suitable grounds. Furthermore, nowadays awareness of society about the detrimental effects of human civilizations on natural life has been raised, so people are increasingly concerned with conserving organic living forms. Taking bears as an example, people in Vietnam used to hunt and kill bears to extract bear gall, however, this practice has gradually been alabeloned thanks to the education of the government. 

In conclusion, the reason that leads individuals to believe that any measure to deal with the negative effects of humans on nature is overdue is that it has lasted for too long. Nevertheless, several methods can be taken into account to solve this situation, such as the application of technological innovations in conserving wildlife. From my point of view, human effects on wildlife can be reversed using technologies and raising social awareness about biodiversity.",9,8.0
"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.
What are the reasons for this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","Having concentration at educational institutions is so essential to learn lessons properly which students lack this ability nowadays. The fundamental reasons that cause low concentration might be stress and sleep disorders. However, by taking some actions and changes in pupils' lives, they can solve this issue which I explain more in this essay.

To find the reasons caused the distraction, humans' brain functions should be observed and what problems affect this. Having anxiety is one of the main problems. Nowadays, students have plenty of ambitions for their future which results in making their minds busy with thoughts. If people worry about important obstacles, they cannot pay attention to other things. Moreover, students who do not have enough sleep at night their mind does not become energetic enough to face distractions. Many children spend their time playing video games which makes them sleep late or experience insomnia during the night. Consequently, their brain would be too tired to be able to focus during the day.

However, by altering their lifestyle, students can solve this problem. Meditation is one of the beneficial exercises which humans can do to practice concentration as well as reduce their stress and organize their thoughts. In addition, by managing time accurately to have better sleep, they would have a sharper and focused mind. For example, time allocated to screen times should be decreased and dedicate the extra time to being ready for sleep sooner.

In conclusion, having problems concentrating in academic places has become annoying for students; stress and sleep deprivation can be their constructer. Nevertheless, a solution such as a good time plan for hobbies and sleeping and meditating every day may omit the dilemmas.",7,7.0
"Some people think the news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A lot of millennials are of the notion that daily updates from the world do not play a vital role in the life of an individual. It is merely time wastage to read newspapers and watch the news on the television. I partially agree with the aforementioned statement and will discuss both sides of the topic.

Analysing the statement, many people believe that, nowadays, watching updates related to the personal lives of famous people which usually includes sportsmen, actors, actresses, business tycoons and politicians is futile. They feel observing this newsnews not only waste their time but also leaves a negative impact on the lives of an individual, especially youth and teenagers. It is believed youth easily get influenced by their choices, behaviour and fashion trends which usually have a negative effect on them.

Explaining further, another school of thought belong to the masses who support the idea of telecasting and publishing the news. Due to ,globalisation it has become important to keep ourselves updated with the happenings of the world. Moreover, it also enriches our knowledge and enhances our vocabulary. To add to this, global news keeps us informed about the latest discoveries and innovations.

To recapitulate, in my view, news broadcasting is really helpful and knowledgeable as it keeps us up-to-date with emerging technologies and events happening across the globe; however, sometimes the news related to the personal lives of famous personalities is completely useless and a waste of time. Therefore, individuals should decide on which side they ought to invest their valuable time.",6,6.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Currently the trends to find historical stories about the building has not be the emerging phenomena on social media or in some articles. Personnally, searching the informations about the place that they have been living in is just to verify the quality of their house and sometimes for personal reasons. In addition, it is easy to gain informations on the Internet, this essay will discuss more.

To commence with, the reasonable answers are related to the quality of their home or their flat especially the durability of materials used. In fact, they are not always tough enough to suffer presures so the gorvernment or managerments dismantle the structure after 2 decades used as usual. Moreover, customers have desire to research the spirituality based compability, which can be only  explore via the history.

"Some people believe that the main benefit of international cooperation is the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world of business. Discuss both views and give your opinion","There are groups of people who believe that international cooperation is for  the environmental protection, whereas some believe that the only benefit from such collaboration is for economic growth. In my perspective, environmental protection is possible only if the countries can get rid of greed.

Firstly, the environmental protection is only feasible if all the countries join hands in eliminating carbon emissions. Furthermore, there are nations that are already staring at the great perils as the repercurssions of global warmings. For example, countries like Maldives and Indonesia are constantly under the threat of having their entire cities being submerged within decades. And there are landlocked countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Mongolia that do not need to fear this threat but this doesn't mean that they can start to increase their carbon emissions. Moreover, only with a collective effort from all the inhabitants of this planet, we can curb the damaging effects on the environment.

Secondly, protective the environment is not the job of one specific country, in fact, the onus is on all of us. On the other hand, the alliance between countries is mostly for economic gains. For instance, countries like China and unfortunately Australia as well are more focused on making financial gains rather than focusing on the environmental issue. To elaborate, in Australia, we have coal mines and timber factories that export materials that are harmful to the environment. Having said that, both the countries have introduced and implemented few projects but most of them are done haphazardly. Hence, all these international co-operations are focused mainly on business.

In conclusion, environmental protection is possible to achieve if all the countries come together. However, unless the countries are able to overcome the greed of financial gain, businesses will be the only sector benefiting from these international collaborations.",8,7.5
"Some people think that students benefit from going to private secondary schools. Others, however, feel that private secondary schools can have a negative effect on society as a whole. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, education is the most important issue to peoples. Some people think private secondary school will have an effect on society and some people think it will be beneficial to students. There are so many debates to this issue. This essay will discuss more points of view and the ideas of private secondary schools.

Firstly, private secondary schools well know that it is a non government school which is parents have to pay for the  school. The arefees also quite expensive for a low-income peoples. Benefits from private school actually is a good investment in your child's future. They usually provide a good learning scheme for their student, the pupils will be guided in more intensive ways to learn and adapt the knowledge compared to government secondary schools.

However, the government secondary school is a place that all parents will afford to send their children. They will provide more free fees and parents will not so burden to pay for their children's education. Therefore, this will affect children's focus on learning due to the large of students in a classroom, teachers will not able to control the students all this will affect  our children.

In my conclusion, if we can afford to send our children to private secondary school is greater choice. However, it all depends on our financial level so will be not burdened for our children education.",0,<4
"Some people think that technology makes life complex, so we should make our life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is a common belief in today’s world that technology makes our lives more and more complicated, and it had better be removed. Although I accept the former opinion, I believe that the latter is untrue. 

On the one hand, nowadays, most people use social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok,.... for entertaining and networking purposes. Besides various compliments that people get from those sites, they also receive a lot of negative judgements about their bodies, lifestyles and behaviors that make them sad or even depressed. For another reason, we are living in a world which lacks connection between people, most of our relationships are through social media, resulting in a lack of thorough understanding of the true personality of each. Therefore, several arguments appear and make our lives very complicated. 

On the other hand, despite the drawbacks which technology brings us, life without it will be even more terrible. Firstly, technology makes our lives more convenient, it saves us a huge amount of time. For example, in the past, if we had wanted 100 copies of a document, we would have had to write that document 100 times, but now, a print assists us, it can generate an unlimited number of copies that you want. Secondly, technology contributes to our learning process and it is also one of the top reasons why people are getting more and more intelligent. Today, just by sitting in front of a computer’s screen, we can easily access worldwide knowledge on the Internet, and becoming a master in our favorite areas has never been so easy. 

In conclusion, in spite of the fact that technology triggers detrimental effects in our lives sometimes, I strongly believe that a life without it will be such a disaster.",6,6.5
Parents should encourage children to spend less time studying and more time doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In our current,generation I Believe that parents should encourage her to spend more hours on physical exercise and less hour  studying because nowadays heir is lazy to do any physical exercise.

To talk about the heir in the current people they are doing most of the things  online which makes the public lazy and unhealthy example online study, online purchases, and online games. The previous human being  if we talk they are more healthy than the current generation the reason for that community in current children play the online game but previous kids play outside the home they body to become fit by during playing time they running, jumping all activities keep them fit and current generation spending most of the age for indoor activities like video games, watching movies, spending time in social media.

Moreover, the points mentioned above are a new generation of children who are looking for individual growth  don’t have the mentality to help others because they are not connected directly with the population like before. The previous community know each other and always help others. They are having the capability to help others  while interacting with all society around them.

To conclude all the online or digital markets make society lazy and unhealthy because they are not doing anything physically like the previous community that make a lot of changes in our life the current generation of the nation are getting sick easily because of  not doing any physical activities. Studying is also important but if we don’t have  good health we may not be able to focus on our studies too.",6,6.5
"Some people think the developments of technology make people's life more complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Currently, the technology is developing rapidly. It can be seen from the external environment that it is developing so much. Even in educational institutions, robots will be employed. I think this is a big mistake

The USA schools recently conducted a research work and expertise in the field that about 700 teachers are at risk of missing.Instead of them, robot teachers will be accepted(тезис)

Firstly a teacher is not only a source of information, but also a person who gives life lessons and advice and supports in difficult times. Only the assumption that in the future only doctors, psycho-experts and politicians can be replaced by robots is true. And the amount of threats to the rest of the specialist owners is slightly lower.

Secondly a tutor who works as a teacher will not need specialists in the future. After all, rather than waste, it will be replaced by robots that work according to time and system, or another area of technology can deprive these specialists of their jobs.

For example, a simple English tutor. After all, mobile applications, sources of information provided by the internet, all this does not require much work. The amount of your losses will also be reduced.

In conclusion I want to say Robots will not be able to occupy the place of the teacher they will not be able to communicate well with the child.

It is even less likely if you consider that implementing robots in the classroom is not economically scalable, and does not bring major financial benefits.",3,5.0
Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other. while others think that people have become independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the ever-connected modern world, some people think that we are more dependent on each other, while others argue that we have spread our wings and become individualistic. I agree with the latter stance, and in the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall discuss points and reasons to support my view.

There are several reasons for arguing that we are more dependent than ever on others. Firstly, life has become inherently difficult. With the high cost of living, young individuals depend on their parents or partners to fulfil basic needs like food, shelter, and education. Secondly, humans have become more ambitious. Hence, to compete better, they sometimes tend to depend on their parents to look after their kids, pets, and house. 

However, people have also become self-supporting in several senses. For example, in many countries, formerly-joint families have fragmented into numerous nuclear families and handle both personal and professional spaces like champions. Moreover, humans now utilise global connectivity to its optimal extent as they are seen studying in universities abroad, living in different countries and often travelling alone. Even more so, people have adapted to living and working alone. Furthermore, women have become financially independent and make their own decisions which prove that societies are gradually moving towards a more self-reliant stance.

In conclusion, it is true that humans are still dependent on each other for the basic necessities and for maintaining connections with others since they are social animals. But, recent trends suggest that they as a species have become more self-sufficient than ever before, and I predict our independence will only gain prominence in the future.",10,8.5
Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both vies and give your opinion.,"It is often thought by some that video games have negative effects on children in so many different ways, others think that playing video games on the computer is able to get benefits on children's development. In my opinion, I think practicing video games have so many drawbacks. 

On the one hand, playing video games in front of the screen may strongly affect their vision level. In other words, the screen is releasing such kinds of lights that may damage the eyes in a direct way, blue lights, for example, especially if these children are playing for long hours facing the display. In addition, video games can easily lead to addiction, which will affect the children's performance in school or inside the house towards their parents. 

On the other hand, games can improve the ability to think of children. For instance, some video games require using the brain to solve the game such as puzzle games or mysterious games which may help them do their daily live tasks.

In my opinion, video games generally are not a good option for people, especially children. the time they will spend on the display playing games, it would be better if they use it to develop their personality. Furthermore, avoiding computer games may increase the chance to aim at reading books and get more attention on their school duties. 

To sum up, people may vary their opinions about computer games. I believe that if video games are banned, this will give the children the opportunity to develop their selves.",4,5.5
"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","According to some people administration should stop the sports that are risky, while few others have an opinion that individuals should have liberty to perform any kind of sports or activity. In my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters.
Firstly, the sports activities which are risky, should be banned by the government as, they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop. Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die.
Secondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed.
As a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.

"Some people think that the modern communication technology is having a negative effect on a social relationships. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days more people are using advanced technology due to being in contact with others. Although some argue in fact this kind of communication would put our societal relationships in  danger, I personally suppose hi-tech communication might trigger social connection.  

Allocating the budget to areas without innovative technology or the internet and additional improvement of infrastructures by authorities would resolve the low-tech problems and following this, people will have access to high-speed internet and be more in contact. While in some limited occasions, like living in remote areas, people may not have access to the easy-to-connect internet or modern technology also maybe these people living are poorer than people living in urban areas therefore the rate of being in contact with their relatives through the internet would considerably decrease. However, this issue would be easily solved by responsible officials who can provide fair accessibility for mentioned individuals and ,consequently more social connection will occur.  

Using  online platforms or cutting-edge technology in order to keep social relationships not only may lead to strengthening the cordial connection between people  but also could have another beneficial profit including improving the level of mental health and well-being for those who suffer from a lack of confidence. In other words, with the advent of technology people can contact  others more simply and easier than what was in the past and, certainly they would greet or meet together just by pushing some buttons through a virtual network while meeting in actual places they need a lot of time to arrange. Additionally, this large amount of connection would enhance the mood of individuals who are shy or scared of being in actual places through virtual connection may improve their self-confidence after a while.

In conclusion, with various benefits of connecting by means of  technology such as improving the level of relationships or some positive impact on  mental ,health I absolutely believe people can take more advantage of modern technology in their life.",5,6.0
"Many studies have shown that most criminals have a low level of education. Some people say that to reduce the crime rate, criminals must be educated within prisons. It will improve their prospects of employment when they are released. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and relevant examples.","Many investigations indicate that inadequate education is the most common characteristic of criminals. Some people argue that providing compulsory education to criminals in prison can effectively reduce the crime rate. In my view, I am in favour of this statement because not only do criminals can be learned professional skills for future employment, but also it can rebuild their personalities.

First, people can be provided more opportunities to find a job by getting useful skills through education. For example, wall painting, such as construction workers' skills, may be able to help criminals to get a secure job when they are released. It can be foreseen that a stable source of earning money can reduce the crime rate because their life is satisfied by enough remuneration, and then people will not take a risk to get extra money through crimes.

Second, another feature of education is that their characteristics can be improved by importing a correct sense of value. For example, the government can introduce some lessons about how people can get far away from crimes in an interpersonal communication environment taught by psychologists such as refusing money and drug attractions , so criminals, especially those who are still teenagers, can have a clear and profound consciousness of crime and will not tend to do it again.

In summary, education not only means getting academic achievement but can build a path for us to be better. Therefore, it can be implemented for criminals during imprisonment, giving a second chance for them to contribute to the world.",8,7.5
"Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.",6,6.5
"With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.",11,9.0
"Some believe technology has made our lives too complex and the solution is to lead a simpler life without technology.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people claim that the best option to avoid complexity in their life is to live without technology. I completely disagree with this statement because of its important roles in terms of supportive education and professional work.

The first reason I believe that technology supports learners’ study journey. It is more convenient for students who prefer studying with teachers through Internet rather than at school. Advanced platforms, these help learners with their study activities that are the same as on campus. Whatever they need, they can use it for many purposes. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, online learning was popular in many countries where all educated institutions were closed. Therefore, it is clear that the technology has useful benefits even in  bad conditions. 

The second reason is that it improves connection at the workplace. Those who always have to work with people can keep in touch with them without losing connection. Particularly, working people who specialize in customer service departments. They can keep in touch and respond to all requirements of their clients at any time and place. For instance, designers use mobile applications like Telegram to create a group for discussing and reviewing projects for the clients. Thus, this trend might improve and maintain the customer’s needs. 

In conclusion, people think that their life may have more complicated regard with technology. However, I feel that it plays an essential role in our daily education and working lifestyle since it keeps people stay on track with their studies and work. As a result, people’s life gets more convenient and comfortable.",3,5.0
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your opinion?","Nowadays, progress in robotics leads to vision that one day robots will replace humans everywhere in workplaces. While it really looks feasible in different factories and construction sectors, but in areas like psychology where it personally varies a lot regarding how to proceed with different cases human still will be the only source of proper solutions. We’re going to review this question closely here to better understand why not all jobs may be performed by robots.

Robots for sure could eventually replace humans in simple service jobs with a few functions. That’s because involving humans into this kind of job is far more expensive than using automated devices with simple algorithms. For example, cashiers, delivery men or even driver functions are already overtaken by robotic solutions. That’s really attractive because robots do not need weekends and extra payment for holidays so it’s cheaper and for sure self-driven cars can go for longer distances without stops. For these reasons that jobs which can be managed by robots will be overtaken by them.

Same time there are some particular jobs requiring special human-specific skills. On basic these jobs are based on high-level mentality skills and kind souls. That's such jobs like psychologist, teacher, doctor and nurses. Robots will never step in this area because of the requirement of deep kindness and humanism. 

It’s quite clear already that robots will end most of human employment. Low skilled positions could be already overtaken everywhere, howeverhowever untouched areas for human personal responsibility and art will still exist. At last only few human jobs will survive in this rising robots workforce appliance.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Dicuss both views and give your opinion ?","In order to achieve success in a career, some people think that completing tertiary education is the best guarantee, while others consider getting first-hand experience right after school more valuable. In my opinion, the best option depends on which career path we choose. 

First of all, if we want to get professional jobs such as engineers, doctors and accountants, graduating from universities would definitely give us a better head start. Moreover, we will need the knowledge enquired from these higher education institutes to work in these fields, as we can not imagine the harm it will bring, if a surgeon, for example, operates on patients but does not have the necessary knowledge of the anatomy of the body. Besides, these highly qualified occupations also have high competition, thus graduating from established or well-known universities will be even more advantageous.

However, in fields like businesses or marketing which require a lot of soft skills and networking, heading right to work after school can be of better advantage as the exposure and experiences gained are proven to be of higher value than theories learned.  Furthermore, they can always learn from their business mentors or enrol in part-time studies while at work to further qualify themselves. Jobs like marketing executives and business personnel are a few examples of this category. 

In conclusion, whether to undergo tertiary education or not will depend on the jobs that we are interested in. Professionals will definitely need to be qualified while those in business and marketing might get better outcomes if they start early.",8,7.5
"As well as making money, business also have social responsibilities.  To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Apart from focusing on revenue and profit, a business has responsibilities towards the community. I   believe, each company or business has to play their part in improving the lives of people and environment. They should strongly follow the best practices which will benefit the world around us and   its living beings.  Businesses has to ensure that their products are not affecting consumers health or causing negative side   effects in long or short term. For example, if a company is selling sugary drinks, then the ingredients and   the amount of the sugar should be clearly mentioned on the packing. It's their responsibility that the   end user is aware of the negative side effect it can cause to the health. Companies can also run   awareness ad campaigns on television or radio to teach people about the positive of health benefits due   to less sugar consumption though it can decline their profit.  Another example of ""social responsible"" practice can be towards environment. Using re-cyclable   materials to build or pack an item can be expensive for a company. However, if they are not using   environment friendly manufacturing material, it can be harmful for the climate or even endangered life   of animals. We have seen such incidents multiple times and there was even a massive awareness   campaign by World Wildlife Federation (WWF).  In conclusion, a business owe to the society just like another person who is concerned about his or her   well being and neighborhood. The reach of an organization's product is far more than an individual   person hence they should lead and contribute for the betterment of everyone and planet.",1,4.0
"Studies show that that criminals have a low level of the education for this reason , some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educated people in prison so they can get a good job.  To extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","At the current time, there are several studies find that many of the criminals are non-educated or have a lower level of education. Although, I believe they should be punished in the prison, I agree that trying to reform them by educating them should be taken into consideration. 

On one hand, committing crimes, it is a serious issue, which must the government take an action toward by putting restrict punishments. In other words, the government must protect the population as well as try to decrease the number of crimes by punishing the criminals during the period they were staying in jail. That means, if we offer them the education without punishing them, that would be as a reward, which completely they do not deserve. However, we could introduce some arrangements, which might help them when they released. 

On the other hand, I agree that providing some arrangements, namely education would be as an opportunity for them to start a new life. To illustrate that, many studies nowadays figure out that most of the criminals lake of education as it leads them to commit crimes. Consequently, if the government gives them the opportunity to study and earn the degree, this aid will help them to avoid committing crimes and be an active member in society. For instance, they can figure their skills and try to develop themselves to create their own business or apply for a labour. 

In conclusion, I totally agree education is one of the most effective elements to reform the criminals; however, I believe they should be punished first also, this should take the priority before education. In addition, I recommend that the government can provide some strategies for the public to make them aware about the danger of crimes. That can decrease the number of crimes.",8,7.5
Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.,"Green energy is been regarded as the future energy for mankind, moreover,the fundamentals of achieving the same rely on reprocessing the waste. While some argue this should be educated at school level and others would like this initiative done from their homes. In this essay, we shall discuss both views and state my opinion.

On one hand, schools have been institutional in developing children cognitive skills therefore all good behaviours are cultivated here. While waste management is a profound topic and requires an in-depth analysis of how the process works or implemented. Furthermore, tutors have authority over their pupils hence they pick up subject matters efficiently. Educational institute emphasis on reusing most of the resources at school, adding to this, student comprehend the reason and significance of reducing waste such as plastic and glass. For instance, Science as a subject, demonstrates the impact of plastic and non-biodegradable materials on earth’s soil, as these take up nearly million years to decompose, consequently converting these materials to toxic and destroying mother nature.

 

On the other hand, young people often look up to their parents as inspiration to learn life skills. As they spend quality time at home, all behavioural attributes of kids are related to  them, so they should bring upon the habits of recycling waste at home. For example, when parents bring thumb rule of segregating waste at their homes, children at young age practice to keep waste as per the category and this behaviour can be carried across at various places like parks, social events, and public transport. As a result, children are instilled with the habit of re-cycling and segregating waste at an early age

 

To conclude, education on recycling waste can be beneficial as it explains the impacts on the environment and what could be done to avoid this catastrophe. Also,parenting should ensure their children learn the habit of separating waste at home. In my opinion, both methodologies must be implemented to have a better future.",10,8.5
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","There is no doubt that people are becoming interested in discovering places they in. This information can be gathered by many ways which would be discussed in this essay.

The main reason for finding information is financial security as more and more people try to buy an apartment for a property. It’s very important to know what is the history of that place, as some factors may contribute to increase or decline of the cost, like murder, stealing and other criminal actions. On the other hand, if this place was owned by a celebrity or the district has a unique history or breathtaking view, the price may go up. 

There are many ways how this kind of information can be found. First and foremost, is looking for a data in the Internet. There could be some articles in the local e-magazines, publications on the Facebook or other media sources. The Youtube platform also may suggest some videos which contains the information needed. 

The other source is meeting the local people which live there for a long period of time. It could also be possible to go to the local shop and ask the people about the district they live in and possible myths that could be taken into account.

Buying a property is a very responsible process which brings people financial stability and support and knowing the history would be essential for the future money investment. There are several sources which help find information about the building: Internet, local people and shops.",2,4.5
Holding International games such as The Olympic Games is an exciting event. Some people think that it has positive effects while other argue that it is a waste of money. Dicuss both sides of view and give your own opinion.,"Conducting worldwide sports events, in particular, The World Cup or The Olympic Games is not only an enjoyable experience but also can terminate into promotion and upgrading in terms of sport. However, the opponents do believe that these games would squander national currency. In the following essay, both views will be elaborated on. 

Perhaps, the major irritating drawback of these multinational races is their expenditures. Since a large amount of deposit should be spent on them by the governments and honestly, it would be provided via taxes which are paid by the citizens. Therefore, it may put the public under pressure and this can not satisfy them. Though, some folks think that these expenses could vanish hunger and poverty all around the world, so, politicians must utilize their taxes for more essential issues.

On the other side of the coin, the advocators including me, are of the opinion that these global games not only could result in meeting multicultural people but also draw multitude numbers of tourists and can be a lucrative source of revenue. As a consequence of visiting a wide range of tourists, the citizens' communication skills and also their income could be raised as the visitors have to pay for visas, accommodation fees and transportation services. Thus, economical growth can occur, subsequently. 

To recap the main points from what was mentioned above, it can be concluded that holding multicontinental sports events regardless of not being cost-effective, neither would waste money nor is futile and would bestow various blessings to the supplier nation.",6,6.5
Many people think that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a common impression that interviews are not the apt way to decide on the possibility of hiring a particular person for a particular job. This essay will provide an answer to the question of why I completely agree with this statement ?
Firstly, it is impossible to understand the complete personality of a human being via a meeting like in the areas of analytical thinking, where a meeting may only give a vague description of the participant's thinking process. However, this cannot be the only best approach but it can be one of the indicators of hiring an individual. For instance, in an interview conducted by Google, the candidates were asked to fix a physical computer after it broke down. In this case, the practical test taken by the participant to solve the problem was recorded as the analytical ability of the person and virtues like loyalty to the company and attending office regularly were gauged using an interview. Therefore, it is recommended that an interview should not be only the step while recruiting a professional but it can play a part in the entire procedure of recruitment.

Secondly, Nowadays people attend interviews with the goal of securing a job rather than providing information about their true behaviour.For example, we have seen some contestants of Miss World Competition 2017, who have declared that if they win the contest, then they would donate the prize money to the poor people of their country and after winning the prize, they chose not to donate that money. This is because the goal of participants is to win the contest rather than show their true character to the judges. So, without honesty, Interviews cannot be the right procedure to assess the suitability of an individual for a specific job.

To conclude, I strongly support the idea that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position. However, we can recommend that interviews should only be a part of the complete proceeding of hiring a candidate, just like written tests and group discussions.",5,6.0
"Some people say that what children watch influences their behavior. Others believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behavior most.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is an incontestable fact that children's conduct frequently generates a great deal of heated debate.Children's conduct will be controlled by what they see on TV is supported by few , while the opposite school of thought suggest that it is influenced by the duration of time spent on TV.This essay deals with this controversial topic from a different perspective with justified illustrations in the upcoming paragraphs. Personally , I am in a favour of the former view.

Convincing arguments can be made that children's attitude is impacted more by what they watch.To commence with, Children who watch educational videos like English grammar or Math on TV will have more understanding of the subjects. In other words , people are moulded by what they watch . It will improve their thinking capacity in their respective fields . Therefore, their analytical skills can be fostered and it will improve their problem-solving skills. For instance, when a student is given a question to solve during  class hours or any exam,practice made through watching videos will help in solving the questions. As a result , students will benefit more if they learn it earlier . Apart from this , Moral videos can be shown to them since they are the future generation who will take forward the country.

On the other hand, watching videos have few distractions like the time they spend on it. Natural children's behaviour tends to have more physical activities. by making them watch videos it will curb the physical activity and they will become lazy, Which will have an impact on their health. Although this has posed a serious menace to the attitude of the Children , certain solutions can be put in place to tackle this issue.

In Conclusion, In this day and age with the advancement , technology it is inescapable to watch TV children and its impact on their nature due to many factors . Any technology must be used to our advantage keeping in my mind that We should the technology and not vice-versa. Children can watch TV but parents should decide on what they watch.",7,7.0
Some people think advertisements may have positive economic effects whereas others think there are negative social effects because individuals are not satisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In some perspectives, commercial institutions could gain more attention and boost their revenue based on advertisements, while the opponents argue such means of promoting provoke a simple standard of beauty which lower people's self-esteem. 

To begin with, since celebrities with perfect physical figures and stunning faces could make one's product more valuable, and stimulate a trend of imitation among young individuals, a growing number of companies are willing to invest a tidy sum in advertisements. For example, as one of the most famous underwear brands, Victoria's Secret is known in favour of hiring skinny models, they even refuse to produce their products in large sizes, making young girls proud of being able to fit in their clothes. Fast expending of such brands indicates that they make a bank out of such methods. 

On the other hand, a growing number of young individuals rely on unhealthy ways to lose wights, including extremist diets or smoking. While those famous brands enjoy a great number of profits gained from advertisements as such, thousands and millions of young people struggling with eating disorders and mental illnesses. On top of that, those who are not able to reach that modern beauty standard see themselves as looser, not only will they lose confidence in public, but in some drastic situation, they might hurt themselves. Take those models on catwalks as an example, they are appreciated by many people, however, little do they know, to maintain what so-called perfect figure, those models are pickier with their outlook, which makes most of them dislike how they look. 

To conclude, it is inevitable that advertisements could benefit brands with their fame and income, however, the potential hazards it causes should not be overlooked, since they could endanger the younger generation, physically and mentally. Therefore, in my opinion, I believe there are more disadvantages than positive effects regarding commercial advertisements.",7,7.0
More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, plenty of people are becoming totally overweight and  society come up with a solution that the cost of fattening foods should be made expensive so that it will reduce overweight folks. However, in this essay, I tend to disagree with the statement and I will explain some reasons regarding  this.

To begin with, our mass of body is our own responsibility. The problem is not with the food, but the habits of the individuals. Thus, the best suggestion is not to increase the price of the foods, but how can we maintain our health in terms of controlling our desire to eat, get some exercise, and commit to it. Moreover, there is no guarantee if the price of food with higher fat is high, people will stop consuming it. For instance, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia said that 50% of All You Can Eat Restaurant's customers are people with a range of weight from 80 to 90 kilograms. So, it means people who are having overweight bodies are aware of their condition but still choose to eat a lot of meat which contains so many fats . 

On the other hand, we cannot force the companies who are selling fast food to raise the fees when the major problem is on us. It will impact the profit as well as  the employees who work there. For example, a chicken company in Indonesia, namely Chicken Mash Bensu is increasing the price of the dishes by 3%, while they are hoping to make more profit, the situation is getting worse because they suddenly lost numerous customers, and after 6 months, the brand is bankrupt. 

To sum up, I strongly disagree with the idea of blaming the fattening food and then asking them to adjust their value in the hope we will stop buying it instead of adopting a healthy diet when our load of body is getting wider.",7,7.0
"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

","Despite knowing the importance of environment conservation for a long time, human activities have been damaging the earth we live. It is believed by some, increase the price of petrol and other fuels for vehicles is the best method to tackle environmental problems while some others have an opposite opinion. Nevertheless, in this essay, I totally disagree with the former view, reasons would be explained in the proceeding paragraphs. 
It is accredited that vehicles are one of the unavoidable needs of the present day, whether it for transportation of goods or commutation. If the cost of petrol and diesel increase, it will definitely affect the price of all daily commodities. For instance, many middle-class families' budget, they have a fixed income, may be damaged due to this. As such, a hike in the cost of fuel is not the ultimate solution, hence it has a detrimental effect on not only the productivity but also the economy of the countries.
On the flip side, effective measures to be taken to reduce the use of vehicles by creating awareness and promote green protocol. If employees in a company pool their cars, it would reduce both traffic congestion and fuel consumption. Sweden has a perfect carpooling system is the best example of this. Over and above, every individual should take a necessary step to protect the environment since different valuable species are vanishing. Safeguarding can be done by reuse, recycle, and reduce the utilization of natural resources.
To recapitulate, having gone through various aspects, the rise of vehicle fuels has a negative impact on the economy. Environmental problems can be tackled by creating proper awareness and reduce the use of natural resources. It is hoped that future generation will take fruitful action to conserve the ecosystem.

"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many people advocate that, the older members of families should be cared for by families' younger members when the older ones are not able to take concern of themselves because of physical, mental or financial problems of theirs and this should be mandatory by law which I disagree with since everybody does not have the same economic situations, living conditions or relationships with parents as younger members.

First and foremost, it is clear that taking care of an old person demands quite time or enormous financial power in order to hire someone to provide care to the older instead of themselves, but the young members might not have these opportunities because of their work hours or low income. In addition to that, some people live in different cities or even different countries than their extended families. Thus, even if they desire to look after them without legal enforcement, they couldn’t do it because of their conditions. For example,their locations,work or money. 

Secondly, even though they have the power to support them considering time, revenue or short distance, they would not want to do it because of their relationships with their older ones. There is a good chance, they have never known them before and assisting  the older members of your family whom you have never met as an obligation which is created by law would not be fair to them. Furthermore, some people have some terrible memories with the older including mistreatment in abusive aspects so, they should not be their caretakers considering their physical and psychological health.

To conclude, there are many people who think that taking care of the older members when they couldn’t  be legal responsibility for the young members of a family which  I totally disagree with since financial and personal circumstances would show some alteration among individuals.",7,7.0
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent decades, housing scarcity in metropolitan areas has been receiving a great deal of public attention. While some assert that only government has the power to solve this problem, I disagree with this view and I believe that this issue should also be addressed by the private sector.
     On the one hand, The authority’s role in balancing demand and supply in housing is indisputable.First, since the politics has the ultimate right  in land management with the huge  resources from the national budget from tax collection, the state can build social housing at low prices coupled with the financial package for people with low income to afford their apartments with mortgage loans. Consequently, these actions are able to reduce the lack of housing in the metropolis. Second, local authorities could encourage companies to move their business to rural areas so that suburban dwellers would no longer have to commute to city centre to work, which in turn reduces urban population density.
     On the other hand, private real estate corporations are also a necessary driving force behind the supply of more housing.First, in order to decline  the lack of affordable housing, people may opt to live in other cities when the metropolis that they are working becomes crowded. For example, in recent years, a tremendously higher number of people from big cities such as Hanoi capital or Hochiminh city move to Danang city because they believe that they could get better chances to afford houses while still maintaining their living conditions. Second, if individuals only buy houses or lands for the purpose of living, asset bubbles would not happen and real estate companies would be forced to decrease property prices to survive in the market. This means that those cities would become more livable for everyone, not just the super-rich.
     In conclusion, the lack of housing is a complex problem which requires a combination of both the union and individuals  provide for the diverse needs of people. By making these solutions, housing problems in major cities will reduce considerably.",8,7.5
Some people think news has no connection to people's lives. So then it is a waste of time to read the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a statement that suggests that people should not spend their quality time on conventional media such as newspapers and television because its contents are not relevant to human life. From my perspective, I totally with this argument for several justifications analyzed in this essay.

To start with, updating the news in the newspapers and television brings a number of remarkable benefits to not only society but also individuals. Firstly, news can provide people with prestigious pieces of information about other cultures in the world. Therefore, citizens would be able to have a deep understand of these nations as globalization is one of the most prevalent trends in the twenty-first century. Secondly, by following educational content on conventional media, people can be more knowledgeable and thus intellectual standard of a country could improve. For instance, newsreaders and news viewers could learn valuable stories from a myriad of articles and TV shows that interview successful business leaders or famous politicians.

In addition, since conventional media was invented, it has played an indispensable role in society. From a political perspective, as newspaper and television are widespread and affordable, these form of media is one of the most efficient ways to connect government to all members of society. To be more specific, the authorities could utilize newspaper and television as official propaganda to spread new policies of the state as well as educate people to be decent citizens. On the societal level, updating the latest news can help people be aware of urgent domestic issues and global problems as a whole. As a result, the more they read newspapers or watch television, the more sociable they become so that

Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, owing to the rapid advancement of science, the topic of which world predicament should scientists concentrate on in order to figure out remedies appears to be one that is extremely contentious. There are a number of people who believe that health issues of the world should receive the most attention, whilst some people argue that there exist a myriad of problems that are of equal or higher importance. The aim of this essay is to thoroughly explore both points of view as well as elucidate why I believe the concentration should be equally distributed.

 To commence with, healthcare undeniably is a field that deserves great scientific focus and commitment due to a multitude of factors. First of all, the human race is still suffering from incurable and fatal disease, for example, AIDS or cancer, which may possibly result in the short lifespan of our entire race, thus hindering the development of humanity as a whole. As a consequence, it is the role of researchers to come up with the cure for those kinds of disease after excessive analysis and examination. Additionally, because of the numerous new viruses emerging in recent years, for instance, Covid-19, it seems necessary for medical research facilities to be ready at all times to tackle those hazardous threats.

  In contrast, there appears to be a general consensus that several predicaments should be more emphasised by scientific researchers. Those who support this view argue that famine and starvation should not be overlooked by scientists, as this phenomenon is still occurring across the world, presumably due to the climate of various areas, including deserts or wastelands, do not allow cultivation. As a result, residents of those mentioned places can not provide necessities for themselves, leading to mass starvation. As such, high-tech facilities as well as equipment should be developed in order to provide viable methods of growing crops despite the issue of unsuitable climate. Scientists should also turn their focus to environmental pollution due to the fact that more advanced technology can help to ameliorate the ecosystem from the detrimental damages that have been dealt to it.

  In conclusion, while the issues associated with the human's health should be considerably concentrated on by researchers, there still exist problems that are evidently worthy of scientists's focus. In my opinion, health problems alongside other crisis should all be prioritized",6,6.5
"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experiences.","The perennial debate on whether nations should predominantly invest in vocational training over tertiary education ignites varied perspectives. This essay contends that while practical skills are imperative, the merits of a university education cannot be undermined.

Primarily, proponents advocating spending more money on skills and vocational training underscore the immediate applicability of such skills in the workforce. Practical work tends to offer swift economic benefits, as it equips individuals with the expertise to fill the gaps in the labour market rapidly. For instance, a surge in skilled labourers like electricians or plumbers can bolster a nation’s infrastructure and economy. In the same vein, vocational training can be seen as a catalyst for innovation. When technicians and craftsmen excel in their trades, it paves the way for enhanced productivity and, eventually, technological advancements.

Contrastingly, those who support the motion to spend money on university education argue that higher education cultivates a more profound skill set, including critical thinking, analytical abilities, and versatility, which are indispensable in the dynamic global market. Universities act as incubators for professionals like engineers, doctors, and educators, whose roles cannot be understated. These institutions not only provide theoretical knowledge but also encourage research and development. A quintessential example would be the role university research plays in medical breakthroughs, which are fundamental to societal progression.

However, juxtaposing these two educational pathways presents a false dichotomy. It is crucial to acknowledge that both vocational training and university education serve distinct yet complementary purposes. Investing in both areas can yield a more holistic and robust workforce. A balanced approach would not only harness immediate skill sets but also foster long-term intellectual capital which could adapt to future changes in the job market.

In conclusion, a balanced allocation of funds towards both vocational training and university education is imperative. The former addresses immediate economic demands with practical skills, while the latter ensures long-term societal progress through intellectual development. This dual investment strategy is crucial for a nation's comprehensive growth.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In this day and age, there is a developing trend in many nations, in which people are taking an interest in learning more about the accommodation they live in. The following essay is going to discuss the reasons behind this trend and how people could research it.

To begin with, learning about the history of the apartments brings several benefits to the owners such as having a better understanding of the power and water systems of the building. This is a piece of crucial knowledge, especially when the landlords need to conduct any repair or maintenance. For instance, the owners could locate the hidden pipe with ease in order to maintain it, saving them the time and manpower needed to handle the job. Moreover, looking for the past of the accommodations could help buyers avoid purchasing tainted houses. In many cultures, the reputation of the previous owner plays a vital role in the sale of the residence, and if the ex-owner had earned himself a bad name, buyers hardly consider that building a suitable choice. For instance, in Asia, if there was a death happened in the cottage, it is alleged that the customers would not choose to reside inside it for the rest of their lives. 

Investigating the past of the buildings is quite an easy task, as the information about the dwelling is publicly listed on the Internet. However, the downside of this method is that this data is used to promote the sale, so any adverse features would be hidden or not fully presented, thus the customers could be in a stalemate if they do not carefully examine the house. Another way to gather information about the apartment is by asking the neighbours. These people have spent a long time living in the area, and potentially know every detail about the apartment as well as the previous holder. For example, a man has decided to buy a residence, nevertheless, after hearing the story about a whole family who had been murdered inside the shack by the person who lives over the road, he quickly turns down the offer, therefore dodging a house containing bad luck. 

In conclusion, investigating the past of the accommodations could benefit the owners physically and spiritually, as they can save time from maintenance and avoid buying tainted houses, and they can gather information about the buildings by asking the neighbourhood and searching on the Internet.",10,8.5
"The number of TV programs is growing day by day. Some people say it is good as it 
gives people more choices, while others say it affects the quality of TV programs. 
Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Television programs have been rapidly increasing these days due to the technological advancements and wide acceptance of public.

Few people believe its good to have more number of Television programs as it gives more options to choose, whereas some believe it diminutes the quality of the daily soaps.

Now, I'd like to discuss about the positive affects of more number of television programs due to certain reasons, which are stated as below:

Variation - More number of daily soaps will increase the diversification of genres in which they are made. Example - Nowadays, people have started scripting daily soaps on biographies of a person or a crime series which is based on a true story.

Categorisation - Earlier children's were not been able to choose from variety of programs and had to be a part of a family daily soaps. Having said that, those daily soaps were not meant for their ages. However, due to the increase in number of programs on television. Children's can watch series/programs of their category which suits their preferences and IQ.

Increase in numbers of the Television programs also have its affects such as their quality deteriorates and many more. I'd like to discuss some below:

Off-track - Every daily soaps and their channels try to produce and present the best which their competitors are delivering, though they sometimes go obnoxiously wrong and portrays something which they even didn't wanted to.

Commercialization - TV programs have been focussing on increased ratings and earning more money, irrespective of the quality they offer.

Confusion - Enormous collection of programs on television has actually made people confused. Public is actually confused to watch which programs based on their genres preferences.

In my opinion, more Television programs definitely gives freedom to choose from but still, the best TV programs restricts to very few of them because quality of the daily soaps decreases drastically. Therefore, lesser the number, lower the confusion and bests options to choose from.",6,6.5

It triggers the kids to make experiments on the strange places of the house and this experiments turn to passion to search about some facts such as who lived in this place before, which architect has built this area, which historical states  this region had belonged to etc. 

Archives, libraries, collection of old newspapers, and especially internet today link  us easily to information about the past of the places we live in. One can google just the name of the district and wikipedia will suggest how old this place is, which popular historical people have lived there etc. Or people ask their elderly ones how they acquired their properties- so many channels help us to learn about the past. When I was a kid, I used to question my dad and grandfather that what they did during their young years and that way I learned that the first and most lovely place I lived in and grew up was a reward to my grandparent for working hard on the factory. I remember  this made me to have a look at old family photos to see the past designs of our house. 

To sum up, past has always been an interesting topic for people to think about. Maybe more information on the surroundings make us more confident on the future. Exploration love and many resources to learn about history lead us to dig more about the past.",3,5.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming in interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can poeple research this?","Nowadays, people are growing interested in the history of the accommodation they live in. This trend is mainly due to a business agenda for housing purposes and personal beliefs. Thanks to  technological advances like the Internet that makes researching  such information become easy.

There are a few reasons that make people start to search about the place where they live. Firstly, having particular knowledge about the building or the house can help in increasing the house value in the housing business. To illustrate, many customers are extremely into the history and fond of a certain type of building. Being able to explain and create a background story about the accommodation can potentially help the housing agency to win a negotiation with such clients. Another reason is that many people have certain spiritual beliefs that they adhere to. People, for example, believe that living in a house which had a history of a serious crime such as murderer, will result in bad fortune. As a result, searching for information behind the house will ease their decision whether they should stay in that place or not.

There are a number of ways to research such history. The first way is through asking neighbours or local people as they usually have some information about the area or the houses nearby. However, reaching from the internet via a search engine probably is the easiest and most accessible way since it contains most data about pretty much everything. Moreover, as most historical information is being updated regularly, it becomes very convenient to use this platform to find an up-to-date history about places.

To conclude, more people have become interested in the history of their accommodation because of business in housing and personal beliefs, and they can easily get that information from the Internet or from local neighbours.",8,7.5
Some people believe that advertising has a strong effect on a person’s decision-making process. Others feel that it has little or no real impact. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Adverts have become a major source for companies to publicise their commodities. That advertisements have been playing a key role in deciding to buy a certain product for the people is a subject which provokes great enthusiasm as well as stark opposition, and at the times both become somewhat blurred. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate which I will discuss in upcoming paragraphs along with my opinion.

On the one hand, those who consider adverts to have a great impact on the individual's decision to buy something say that it is because of the famous Bollywood stars signed by the marketing companies to achieve more success in their sales. Not only, do they appoint attractive models to influence the customers, but tell them to share their amazing experience of using their products which also play a key role in helping people to take decisions. For example, advertisement related to a fairness cream advertised by a fair skin toned actress influence a number of dark complexion girls to buy that cosmetic cream. Besides, adverts also help the people to make a better choice among the large number of options that one have to buy a single commodity, thanks to the diversity of brands we are provided with. As an instance, one wishes to buy a watch can go through a number of adverts published by different companies which can help him to buy a watch with the desired features of his choice. 

Conversely, however, people who think that such advertisements have no impact on decision making process point to an individual's awareness towards certain things they buy. People have become more aware of the quality of many products which might play a key role in failing to help  people to buy products through various adverts. For instance, people before buying something believe to check the quality by themselves than relying on attractive advertisements. In addition, people these days do not even bother to watch adverts as they prefer to skip these whenever they get the chance to avoid such advertisements. To exemplify, while watching Television, if one gets a break to watch adverts to the middle of a show individuals prefer to change than channel rather than watching the adverts.

To summarize, it appears to me that the opinion of no impact of adverts on the decision of people to buy something favours stronger arguments. As it is one's own decision without getting attracted by advertisements and looking into the quality by himself before buying any product.",3,5.0
"Movies and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have a negative effect on society and should be censored. Others say they are just harmless relaxation.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In recent times, movies and online games which contain inappropriate actions such as violence are widespread. It is widely held that for the sake of society, they should be censored whereas others believe that it does not produce any hazard and is just for relaxation. This essay will explain the justifications behind the two opposing views before the conclusion is reached.

On one hand, being excessively exposed to violence through films and online games can increase the rate of crime commitment. Because they have commonly seen the violence in such media, they might think it is right to do that, so individuals will absorb and might resemble violent practices. For example, Marvel movies often depict heroes fighting wildly against villains, ending up being praised and honoured by the public. This is why the violence existing in movies and computer games should be censored in order to prevent the audiences from misunderstanding and taking after.

On the other hand, it is argued that individuals can relax from playing or watching the media containing violence. To explain, if people are aggressive and stressed, they can release negative emotions by consuming violent media, and they will not actually commit wild behaviours in their real life. For instance, some computer games already contain warnings about  violence and require control from adults for players who are minors. When being supervised or cautioned, individuals will be conscious. Thus, those are effective ways to relieve stress, as well as learning that violence is not an effective way to solve problems in reality.

In conclusion, although the violence existing in movies and computer games is extensively held to pose a detrimental effect on  society, it is just an unrealistic situation created for relaxation. Taking both perspectives into consideration, I am inclined to believe that consumers should be aware of resembling such appalling practices and keep in mind that it is not legal to do that.",8,7.5
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would be benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.Do you agree or disagree?,"People hold different views on whether teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help their nation's society.  As far as I am concerned, my agreement outweighed the disagreement.

To begin with, doing work without a salary can easily cause boring and exhausting for  teenagers. This is because  they need to do the work for a long time without receiving any money when they can use their leisure time doing their hobbies or relaxing after school. As a result, this may lead to conflicts between the youth and their local government. An obvious example is that in many countries because the teen is requested to do voluntary work too much without remuneration, a lot of demonstrations have occurred. The reason for this is that they feel stressed when doing unpaid work.

However, by participating in unpaid work, can gain a large amount of  valuable experience before applying for a job. This can be explained by when commencing a job at an early age, they can have more time to do their work and gain knowledge which would be useful for their future employment. In addition, businesses could  benefit when the amount of money they need to invest in training  beginners will be decreased when they have a large of experience before doing a job. As a result, more money will be spent to increase the product's quality so that local people can buy them at an affordable price. For instance, nowadays many businesses accept the young who do voluntary tasks, this is because less time  is needed to train them and they can use that to enhance the quality of the products and gain more profit.

To sum up,  there are many advantages when requesting the young to do their local unpaid work. However,  governments need to take responsibility to avoid some unwanted conflicts between them and teenagers.",7,7.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.","It is true that there are a number of residents who are interested in excavating the secret behind the complex in which they live .

On the one hand, many reasons can  account for the phenomenon that people tend to find out the secrets of buildings. To begin with, with the development of the economy, people start to realize the importance of the culture of a country, and some of them focus on the history of construction. Furthermore, the media publish magazines and documentaries which are about anecdotes of history of house. For example, one programme on CCTV introduces a traditional building with a vertical view like a circle. This documentary pushes many residents to learn about history of their hometown house. Additionally, authorities encourage residents to protect old buildings that are still being used, which also equips the ability to generate curiosity to research the story from the past.

On the other hand, there are several actions that individuals can take to research these problems mentioned above. Firstly, governments should cooperate with corporations to organize some forums about history of construction to help people study  their house. Besides, it is useful to communicate with the elderly who have been living there for  a long time. For instance, grandparents may know the reason why the house is built . In addition, attaining knowledge of architecture can help people learn the history of house better.

In conclusion, culture, TV shows and governments are the main culprits behind individuals studying the history of the building they live in and actions should be taken along several fronts: through the forum, elder people and knowledge of architecture.",5,6.0
Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Unfortunately, climate change is a bitter reality in the contemporary world. Some people believe that it is time to eliminating climate change, whereas others oppose the argument and wanted to learn new techniques to survive with it. This essay initially will discuss both views and further, I will write my point of view. 

First of all, it is imperative to understand the causes of changing the environment in the world. To illustrate, countries must identify the issues that are provoking different humidity. This will help them estimate the problems that aggravate the matter and then assist us in solving the issues. Hence, it is significant to find out the prevailing circumstances and then identify the resolutions. 

Second, learning the tactics to live with the severe weather conditions is also important. However, this might intensify the issue rather than minimise the problem. For example, planting more trees without minimising the carbon emissions will only solve half of the problem. Hence, without restricting countries on the carbon issue, nations will not be able to fix the climate conditions. In addition to that, with the sudden changes in the environment, it is impossible to learn to live with it, as the weather conditions and worsening on yearly basis. 

In my opinion, it is imperative to take actions against the changes in weather as it does not only affect one nation but the world and this will continue for the generation to come.

In conclusion, nations need to make efforts to work on temperature change and people should also learn to survive with the different weather conditions. In order to, save the earth it is significant to focus on the issue of temperature transformation than to expect  people to live with it.",6,6.5
"In recent years,” responsible tourists” have paid attention to preserving both culture and environmrnt of the places thay visit. However, some poelpe say that it is impossible to be a “responsible tourist”. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, more and more people travel around other place, it became a trendy. Thus, some people encourage visitors to be a ""responsible tourists"" who protect local culture and enviroment. However, it exist some people consider it's difficult to reach the standard of a ""responsible tourist"". Therefore, in the following essay, l will demonstrate my opinion.

Firstly, the local scenic area have no measurement or facility to limit people doing some immoral behaviors. For example, if a person carry many litter and he or she want to alabelon them in to a trash can, but there have no trash can so that some people have to alabelon rubbish anywhere. Secondly, it depends on behaviour habitat of tourists, some tourists have low quality, they will take away some sovenior like stones, soils etc. Meanwhile, we also carve wrrting or design on trees or walls. Although these are insignificant things, if millions of people all do taht, it lead to enormous destruction.

Moreover，in oerder to earn more money, local scenic area management department have no limitation attract people visit here, it maybe change local environment and culture when more and more people visit these places, it will only be a matter of time when these places are contaminated and eventually ruined.

In conclusion, if preserving local culture and ecosystem, the government has to improve management for scenic area, and for individual, we should control ourselves and reduce such impolite action, it will get better and better and we will closer to be a ""responsible tourists"".",3,5.0
Some believe that people are naturally born as leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is under question that leadership ability is either innate or nurtured. Some people believe that it is only natural talent while others hold an opposite side that it can be learned. In my opinion, people can develop these skills thanks to learning and working progress and this essay will focus on this issue.
First of all, it is undeniable that there are many children born with superior abilities that can allow them to become talented leaders. Leaders are usually charismatic, confident and persuasive, without these things, it is very difficult to be an inspirational and leading person. For instance, salesman who often fails to persuade customers to sign contracts or make purchases have little chance of becoming a team leader or higher positions. This failure shows that the ability to make others trust and feel convinced of them is very low. 
However, there are many people who have demonstrated that leadership skills are achieved through training and effort. That is why there is a large number of courses are organized to help those who need to improve the skills required to become a successful leader as well as manager. People, especially who are shy and lack convenient, can learn about public speaking instead of good body language, pronunciation and so on and it will make them better leaders. Besides, needed skills such as how to communicate better, persuade others, be more confident and teamwork can also be cultivated and practiced. 
In conclusion, although some of the factors related to leadership such as attraction are innate, human can still try to develop other skills to compensate for our weaknesses. Thereby meeting the requirements to become a great leader

Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problem is to increase cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environment issue is a major problem in today’s society.  Some strongly believed that, high price of fuel is only option to save environment conditions.  In my opinion, it may help to some extent; however, this is not only a solution to tackle this problem.

To begin with, increasing the price of petrol can help reduce the environmental pollution to some degree. In other words, excessive use of cars emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment. If the cost of petrol and diesel hiked, individuals are starting to use their cars less and this, in turn, can positive development. However, the change in fuel cost will not stop the environment pollution. Beside the vary fuel price can also affect poor and middle-class families.

On the other sides, governments take several steps to resolve these problems. An effective way to control pollution, the government should invest in renewable energy like wind, tide and solar rather than non-renewable sources like coal, diesel and other gasoline products. For example, solar power is in Unite sates has proven it is efficient in power generation. Second, by improving public transportation and reducing the cost of travelling, government can encourage more people to use public transport; this practice can help to clean environment as well as traffic conjunction. In additions, they should ban some materials like plastic which is highly used in our day to day lives. The more using of Non-bio-degradable materials makes climate condition more worst.

To conclude, I strongly believe that the hike in gas price is not the only option to control environment condition. Improving public transport and developing renewable source for power generation is the best way to changes climate conditions.",6,6.5
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that the problem of pollution has a huge impact not only on the environment but on humanity health as well. And the question of whether to raise up the value on cars fuel or not is extremely topical today. I tend to feel that it is a quite reasonable idea and i will give some reasons for it.

To start with the price changes, we have a big probability percentage that people will put up with this and it wil not work, but on the other hand if the government suggests environmentally friendly kinds of transportation or other alternatives such as comfortable public transport, more bike paths around the city and not only on the downtown area. Another great example of replacement fuel vehicle is electro cars. But it is quite clear that such cars need special charging stations, which are rare in small cities all the more so in the countryside.

Furthermore, I believe that the biggest influence on  ecology have manufacturing companies. It is well known that the effects of their exhaust emissions are much bigger than traffic fumes. Finally, we should remember that bigger factories with  great capital should be held responsible for the consequences but not the common people.

To conclude, I do understand the opposing view, which is that gas should not be pricey because it is no surprise that society got used to it. Nevertheless, I suggest that the pushy method is the quickest and easiest way to preserve our planet. Notably, though, I think that it needs to be a gradual process, based on careful support rather than sudden demanding law by the strict government.",3,5.0
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?","One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is the amount of damage from the production of consumer goods. It is undeniable that pollution causes from the making consumer commodity has become an essential part of our life. However, there are several solutions for this global problem.

 One of the main aspects of this problem is the air and water pollutions, which is increases in every year. One of the main reasons behind that is the number of factories and stations, which is discharge sewage into the ocean and exhaust fumes in the air. In fact, making a goods need to release waste materials; therefore, these waste materials exert adverse effects on the nature. For example, in a rural area of China, a large number of trees demolished in the forest is to erect factories with aim of producing iron. This could lead to a global problem or might result the chaos in our future. 

 To tackle this problem government should to strict laws to control the amount of pollution caused by factories. Furthermore, factories need to grow an equal number of trees that they damaged at another place. This may be the easiest way to reduce the amount of damage.

Having weighed everything mentioned up, we can come to conclusion that there are enormous amount of pollution in our world. But, we can control it by creating a new ways of solutions. So it would not be surprising to see some changes in the near future. Actions must be taken urgently, otherwise",5,6.0
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people,
while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, public debate has been going on over whether museums should amuse or enlighten humans. Both viewpoints can be grounded with compelling arguments, which are key for understanding the reasons behind conflict and can broaden one’s horizons, therefore, will be analyzed.

To embark on, a pleasurable experiences in museums would have a range of benefits for the society. To start with, a higher attendance of the institutions would be provoked. For this reason, more tickets would be bought and higher sums of money collected. The financial savings could be used for virtuous purposes when, for example, state museums would give them to the government. The latter undeniably has a dozen of opportunities for investment, including social projects that increase the welfare of the country. Moreover, some museums might become a cheap option for entertainment. If more people can afford the latter, they will have more opportunities for unwinding themselves. Undoubtedly, relaxing and resting after a workday is indispensable for being productive the next day. Eventually, workers could produce more value for their land or environment with their work. 

	But the assertion that museums should serve the purpose of teaching people, has convincing justifications too. One of them is that the facilities could evoke curiosity about the culture along with traditions of a land. This may catalyze the development of national pride and patriotism. Consequently, individuals pursuing such values would get motivated and have an incentive to collaborate, work hard for the nations well-being and promote peace in their surroundings for achieving that. Furthermore, expositions might spark curiosity about some subjects. As a result, there would be more young personas inspired about science, hence, interested in studying. If they learned more, they would acquire more skills for possibly inventing something in the future. If it would turn out to be so, the inventions could help the society like electricity does.

	This leads to the conclusion that making museums a place, which is fun to come to, and utilizing them for enlightening members of the society has a multitude of merits. On the basis of the above discussion it might not be clear for what one should opt for, however, it may be manageable somehow for museums to fulfill both needs and solutions for that should be sought after.",4,5.5
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
 To what extend do you agree?","Many divergent views exist on the relevance of educating children in a co-education school. A great number of people, including myself, are of the opinion that children will face many obstacles later in their life if their parents continue to send their children into single-sex schools. In this essay, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoint on the matter.


The Primary effect on restricting children to only attend single-sex schools is that they will not able to acquire important interpersonal skills to interact with another gender. It goes without saying that when both girls and boys graduate from a university or school, they will be working in their corresponding field of study with another gender. The earlier they know how to behave with another gender, the more they will be able to coordinate and feel comfortable with each other later in their life. My friend, Tina, is a shining example of this. Tina, who was not allowed to communicate with male students during the high-school years because of her family tradition, faced many difficulties in academic life during her tertiary education. Before she knew it, she found very difficult to interact with boys for help in assignments and projects compared to average students.


Not only do children improve their soft skills, but it also hinders the opportunity to create a social bond with another gender. Many boys develop a good relationship with girls during their school years, and this allows them to understand another gender’s personality, feelings, and thoughts, vice versa. By restricting this formation at the early age of their life will create problems in their life when they need to know about another gender for their marriage life. Unsurprisingly, a 2007 study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto found that those students who had mixed-gender classrooms during their education period have a 90% less divorce rate compared to those students who only had education with similar gender. This is because they are able to understand each other’s opinions, likes, and dislikes.


To sum up, I hold to the opinion that there are many negative points of sending children to the same sex-school. It is my sincere wish that parents should be more open-minded and they should send their children to mix gender schools where their children can acquire many necessary skills that help them in their future.",5,6.0
"Some people believe that studying at university or colleges is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","After graduation from high school, young people faced a serious dilemma to decide which choose to get a job or attend college. Both sides have many benefits, however, it depends on a person's ability and personality too. In my point of view, I strongly believe that postsecondary students should attend university to insure have a better job in the future.
To begin with, for young people, they like the idea to start work straight after school is attractive for many reasons. The first proposes is earring money to help them to become independent people, meaning that they can settle down earlier, afford a house, and have a family. On the other hand, there are reasons relates to having a good professional life that they seek to gain experience and work to get promotions in the work. For example, many wealthy people around the world leave college and work in the market for seeking to gain experience. Some individuals seek to learn the business and personal skills that educational institutions do not teach to students.
The main reasons are the best job opportunities have required academic qualifications which have earned a higher salary. For instance, the CEO job requires a special academic qualification to employment for this place. The other reason is related to their ambition to gain more academic knowledge due to the job market is very competitive. In addition, many employees are the ambition to raise their stations on work and become a useful member of society.
In conclusion, both points of view have many positive effects on person lifework, I strongly believe that complete higher education for students overweight the benefits of getting a job after school. In the future, it might be having practical and academic studies in the same progress.",8,7.5
Newspapers ahve influenced people's ideas and opinions. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation?,"Nowadays media sources extremely affect  modern society all around the world, especially its opinions. However, the impact of the mentioned phenomenon is not precise, while discussions are becoming more colliding. In my view, newspapers as one of the most fluent tools of governmental structures have a great effect on  human view. The present essay will cover the core reason reasons for this and illustrate positive consequences.

Regarding the causes of such influence, social media has been a crucial tool of any government since the press was created. Using this field as the area of national interests, states still have an opportunity to provide the most appropriate position which will increase the loyalty of the audience. For example, within the USSR era propaganda was on the peak of the agenda as the option to control the population's minds. Hence, the effect of such policy is still colossal and it influences each society a lot.

However, in light of the pros and cons of this influence, it is hard to generally evaluate the situation at the current moment. For instance, today information is not only provided by a variety of paper-based editions, but a vast majority of media have their own websites, YouTube and Telegram channels, and so on. This leads to the existence of the constitutional right of the freedom of speech which is significant for the modern world. As a result, every person has the possibility to choose which sources can be trusted by him or her. 

To conclude, it should be said that  the principal issue is focused on propagandizing the most loyal and appreciated point of view by governments. Nevertheless, the scores of editions are giant, thus it has a positive impact on humankind. It should be widespread that  freedom of speech is totally important for the population. In this regard, it will influence people's views, but they will have a choice to what extent any information seems to be true and realistic.",10,8.5

Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.
However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.
To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.",9,8.0

More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"These days many people are a lot more cautious about their food intake and lifestyle. Also, an increasing number of individuals have begun healthy eating habits and exercising regularly. This essay will elucidate the reasons for this trend and the ways in which we can encourage more people to avoid junk and exert daily. 

Nowadays, the public suffers from ailments at an early age due to their sedentary lifestyle. Lack of training and consumption of fast food cause detrimental impacts on our bodies. For instance, many youngsters suffer from obesity and heart diseases since their adolescent age. Moreover, eating nutritious delicacies and practising yoga and meditation revives mankind, and releases stress hormones from the body. Due to these reasons, many people make conscious efforts in order to follow a balanced diet and exercise efficiently.

So, for encouraging more personnel toward nutritious consumption and exerting themselves regularly, the government authorities can conduct campaigns to increase the popularity among the masses. Further, the companies too can organise sessions for their employees. For example, they can arrange free sessions for yoga, Zumba and meditation so that their people can get rejuvenated, and this will lead to an increase in their concentration and efficiency. Apart from that it will ensure job satisfaction and increase employee retention.

Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Global temperature transformation has really caused more harm than good. Meanwhile,a few numbers of people are of the opinion that such temperature situations should be resolved and others think that we should focus on developing means of living with it. This essay will elaborate on both sides and  state my own opinion.

Firstly, global warming has an optimal effect on communities' lives and properties. Instead of developing means of living with such climate change which will later cause more calamities and contamination within the environment, it would be better to eradicate such. Climate pollution results from reckless deforestation, excessive industrialization, fossil fuel and littering of the environment with waste products which affects the pathway of the drainage system. Furthermore, our crops and animal extinctions are therefore affected. For example, in the UK, the excess combustion of heat ,underground which led to fire explosions affecting family's lives and properties. Again, living with such situations can affect an individual's immune system exposing them to various diseases. 

On the other hand , people feel that living with climate change is better because it has made living easier with the use of certain technological devices. For example , in a city where there's a power supply problem the use of generators becomes an option for them, again this will affect the use of private vehicles by prominent people, because its usage will be reduced due to the excess pollution from fossil fuel. 

In conclusion, although globalisation has changed quite a lot in this recent times, I believe that its' effect on climate change has caused more harm to animal extinction, plants, human lives and properties.",7,7.0
Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.",11,9.0
"In many countries, governments spend large sums of money on the arts and this is supported by some taxpayers as worthwhile. Others, however, think that this money would be better spent on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Most of the local authorities allotted a budget for artworks and some individuals even provide assistance as it is considered as a long term investment of the country. Some often believe that it is way better if it will be spent on medical and educational purposes.

To begin with, having artwork can boost the progression of the local community and some public officials spend a huge budget on arts. One of the regions in the Philippines, for instance, where the local government invest their money to improve the city by painting all naked walls with different colours and designs, that makes it vibrant and inducing relaxation among the locals. Furthermore, the government should allot money to arts which can be an investment because it provides good tourism business in the country. For example, festivals in the Philippines which held every year, most of the contestants have to create beautiful costumes out of recycled materials. Due to these ideas, a lot of tourists from another side of the world come to visit the place.

On the other hand, some people believe that to spend the money for health improvement and individual's education. Moreover, local officials allotted a designated amount for campaigns to promote wellness in society. Like free consultation and medical assistance is offered in most of the remote areas in the community. In addition to that, public officials are providing free education through a scholarship program and a reduced tuition fee in public schools in order to educate more students who belong to a minority group.

In conclusion, it is necessary to allocate the money which is beneficial to most people. It can be through arts that can boost the tourism of the country and even on health and educational purposes of the people. I believe that proper spending of money is still the best way to serve the community.",10,8.5
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There's a school of thought supporting the expenditure of tax funds towards promoting healthy lifestyle practices and disease prevention over spending exorbitantly on treatment of the sick. While in theory this might sound good, it's practical applications are far from ideal. I disagree with the above statement and this essay will discuss my views regarding the same.

Firstly, disease prevention is a step in the right direction when it comes to promoting health for all. In today's era, where fast food is cheaper than its healthier alternative and where the preference is to order food from restaurants over cooking at home, awareness needs to be created over how detrimental this choice is. Secondly, creating emphasis on building immunity and living healthy also reduces the load on hospitals to care for them, thus in turn saving further government expenses. For instance, advertisements can be directed at the general population urging them to adopt regular exercise and choose food that provides energy over fried food.

Meanwhile, cutting down the funding for treatment of the sick puts all effort spent on promoting healthy living to waste. Ill patients with insufficient treatment will spread disease regardless of any practice that one adopts to stay healthy. Hence primary focus needs to be put on curing any source of illness and controlling the outcome. In today's times of superbugs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, sole maintenance of one's health doesn't get the job done. Apt treatment and isolation of the sick needs to be focused upon, which requires proper facilities and public funding to build and maintain them.

To conclude, focusing the expenditure on promoting healthy practices rather than spending on treating the ill is not the best way to ensure health of a community. Treatment of the ill requires more attention and funding in comparison.",5,6.0
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 
What are the causes of these and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Many factors influence the high volume of sound.It is observed that the problem of certain cities and towns in  all around the world is high volume of traffic.In my opinion,  the high volume of sound may leads to health issues and hearingloss in human beings.
Firstly,each people have different behaviour so, if we on the way of traffic ,some people have no patience or they have to reach at worplace in a correct time.In such situation, people makes high sound for reaching fast to office.This kind of volume provide disturbance to other people in outside and at last it may  leads to health issues.
Secondly,the second reason is ear problemThis happens because people ought to hear sound in a certain amount.when people hear high volume sound,they will suffer ear pain .This may adversely affect the ear canal.As a result, there is a chance for hearing loss.
First of all, control the sound and avoid traffic problems in  cites and town otherwise ,it will affect the people health.Moreover the second cause is hearing problem this can be avoided by move away from this kind of sounding.
To conclude, nowadays the high volume of traffic in a world increasing day by day. I think that we should limit the volume of sound otherwise it leads to severe problems.",0,<4
Holding International games such as The Olympic Games is an exciting event. Some people think that it has positive effects while other argue that it is a waste of money. Discuss both sides of view and give your own opinion.,"Nowdays, it becomes trend that whosoever host International Sports events are more developed countries in comparison to nations who are not showing interest in hosting any such world level events. Hosting biggest sports or adventurous events at national or international level is an advatage for the country. This boost country's economy in many ways which will be discussed in below paragraphs and consequently there are other factors that every country should consider before representing themselves as a interested candidate in hosting such occassions. 

First and formost advantage of hosting such events helps country's to become more popular among others and also give lots of other benefits like more employment,increase in toursim at international level.

People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"People have a wide variety of perspectives on whether or not the government’s budget should be investing in roads and highways instead of public transport systems. While some argue that it must be done due to the benefits it makes outweighed the disadvantages. I believe that both ways have their reasons to be expended equally.

 On one hand, the better roadways are, the safer they will become. It is a common thing, especially in many large municipalities that the wear and tear of streets over time entail the authority's expenditure higher and higher to bring down traffic congestion. By easing commodity circulation, The expansion of thoroughfare systems can promote economic improvement. Furthermore, there are some cases highways play a crucial role in terms of personal mobility when it is not possible on public routes.

On the other hand, greater public transportations are supremely beneficial for not only the administration financially but also for the environment. Additionally, the enormous number of citizens using buses or subways proved that this transportation system is irreplaceable. For instance, a bus can replace several motorcycles on a particular route and consume less fuel due to its large capacity for passengers.

In conclusion, while many residents argue that the national account should be allocated for constructing expressways rather than advancing mass commutes, I once again reaffirmed my point of view that the two categories of systems are immensely essential and well-spending on them can profit us in many ways.",7,7.0
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Numerous characters deem watching TV and reading magazines as a wastage of time, as there is no correlation to citizens' lives; meanwhile, certain groups of people oppose and affirm many necessary pieces of information get announced by the news program. I reckon we should not glean a public's daily news from the press, TV, broadcast, and other media. 

First of all, it got proved that affluent people and wealthy politicians give a bribe to media and TV channels to deceive the population for various reasons. If one of the parliament members offends some major crimes, he or she can conceal the offence by using the power of media deluding people, which is a classical way how the press earns. There are countless incidences relating to this in Mongolia. One of these is Tuvshin, a member of parliament congress, who hid successfully the fact that he raped a girl, and stole a large amount of money from the government thanks to the media, which is one example. Hence, it is crucial to do not believe news reported by media.

Secondly, insofar as the objective of the press and webs is to captivate as many readers as possible so that they can make more money. Many websites are posting many numbers of intriguing news, gossips, and other juicy info through the internet and social media every day. For example, you can observe that there are many trashy but juicy posts on Facebook uploaded by websites. Therefore, we have to react perceptively to these uncertain pieces of information.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that taking information from the media is utterly a wrong idea, as they usually provide citizens with fallacious news. Thus, I state again we must not advocate this.",10,8.5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building thay live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Historical value of a place or the population is undeniable. Nowadays, an increasing number of people are getting interested to find out the true histoy of their living places and properties. This essay will discuss the reasons, and the methodology of finding the history.

One reason of looking for the history could be to find out the attachment with the ancestors. An individual can find his family tradition and can make best out of it. For example, if somebody finds that he was related to a merchant family, who had been in trading business, can get the motivation to recoup the family tradition. Another purpose might be to know the true financial value of the property itself. If the property is found to be attached to a great piece of history, the owners could sell the asset at a maximum price, or they can turn the place into a tourist attraction, like a museum.

There are couple of ways to find the historical aspect of a property. One can cummunicate with the office of records of the government to dig out the references of past ownership. Similarly, professional historians or surveyors can be appointed to check all the previous records related to the propery. 

In conclusion, people who are interested to find the history of their assets, can analyze the past relationship with their property by checking the government records, and with the help of professionals who will be able to surface the true story. Therefore, a true piece if history can be found and admired.",2,4.5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In the present age, celebrities' influences on society have become a sensitive topic being widely spread and discussed. While some people believe that the glamorous lifestyle of famous individuals can serve as a bad role model for society, others assert that a celebrity's job is entertaining people, not setting a moral example.  In the following paragraphs, I will analyse both sides of the argument and explain my opinion. 

On the one hand, the impact of celebrities on society particularly, on teenagers and children is undeniable. To start with, teenagers  having not much  life experience may embrace the luxury of superstars as a model of success. Consequently, they get depressed after not being able to afford certain items that their idols can. As follows, superstars should set an example not only with their media success but also with achievements in their professional life. For instance, Emma Watson can be a perfect role model, because she has gained recognition for her plays in movies and for her women's rights advocacy.  

On the other hand, celebrities should have a chance to live their own lives and have  freedom of actions just like any other people. In my opinion, parents and teachers should become role models rather than celebrities. Children have to be taught critical thinking skills thus, they won't blindly worship anyone and focus on their own achievements.  

To sum up, I would concede that celebrities have a certain impact on people. Despite that, I'm convinced that superstars should not have the burden of setting  a moral example to the population, instead, they should live and enjoy the life they want.",9,8.0
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages","In modern society, the decision to have offspring is postponed to later in life. In this essay, I will describe the reasons for this trend, pros and cons as a consequence of this decision. Firstly I will give examples of possible causes, secondly, I will explain the advantages and disadvantages of this situation. 

To begin with, we live in a very busy lifetime which, is driven by growing expectations from nations and families, focusing on material achievements. We are more stressed and self-absorbed, constantly worrying about our future and careers choices, therefore, we can not afford to have children. Another example which, explains an increasing trend, is the lack of support from the male side, regardless of looking after their offspring. Women are most of the time left with babies at home to provide them with the required care, moreover, ladies spend their time having unpaid housework such as laundry, babysitting, cooking, cleaning. Many females don't want to risk their careers and become housewives.

Advantages clearly work in favour for women hence, they become independent from their partners and have freedom of choice and get a better education, progress in their chosen profession before they decide to create their families. Furthermore, females can grow in power and become leaders of society, providing peace to this world because they are driven much less by their egos compared to males. However, disadvantages become significant; causing a decreased number of youngsters, for instance, European countries have calculated that soon number of elderly people will reach 60% of all population for that reason we might experience a growing economic problem, lacking people to work for older generation's pensions.

In conclusion, I believe that the positive side of this trend outweighs the negative sides, giving more opportunities for better woman's education and jobs. Females can build their careers and after feeling secure create families.",11,9.0
"In today's world, people spend a lot of money on appearance because they want to look younger.

Why does this happen?

Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","These days in the modern world, individuals waste a myriad of money on their youthful appearance. I assumed that this is happening due to the huge amount of advertisements and the inner instinct of being praised for their beauty. So I found it detrimental to the health and self-confidence of society.

Cosmetic industries, like any other industry, catch people's attention through ads. Any company strives to compete with others by illustrating younger models who are beautified with the company's products. This may increase not only the beauty standards but also mislead people about the fact that beauty means youth. Consequently, people would splurge on cosmetic products to modify themselves with such standards. Moreover, everyone yearns to be praised for their beauty. Even though all people are aware of their official age, they will be grateful if somebody admires their physical appearance and tell them that they look young for their age. Individuals who are getting on a bit may hear this admiration less, so they would purchase cosmetic products or even do some aesthetic facial surgery to look younger.

The detrimental effects of this tendency are that it may reduce the social health status. to illustrate, some people may undergo unnecessary plastic surgery or buy cosmetic products to catch up with the trend of being young, so this may have hazardous side effects like emboly and skin disorders. On the other hand, the fashion of looking younger could have a negative influence on people experiencing their aging naturally. For instance, they might lose their self-confidence when they compare themselves with others.

To sum up, there is a piece of evidence explaining that advertisements and people's need for praise cause the trend of being young, which is harmful to people's health and mental status.",5,6.0
Some people think that illegal internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Music has become source of entertainment as it is common these days to download from internet. Some beleive it puts great effect on the whole music industry while other argues that artists'first priority is to become popular through the viral songs. In my opinion, financial lose to the company may lead to be bankrupt. So I agree with the first group, who are against illegal uploads.

On the one side,Producer spend alot of money to hire artists, models, composer and musicians. Apart from this , they also pay to promote their album to get a good deal of profit.However, illegal download from the internet would not be profitable for the company.Hence, it may not be able to invest on the more tracks after bear a great loss. 

On the other hand,  some argue that,singers do not affect by these minor loss because they earn from another source such as advertisements, modeling and through many apps. So, they just need of popularity despite of having a big bag of money.there are many tracks which viral on the reels before posting to the televisions. As a result, many people follows the artist on the apps and make them famous.

To conclude, idea to recreate themselves through a pricy of music could put bad effects on the income of the creaters of music album  for tackle this issue the download of the music should be through the original links only.",1,4.0
"Money should be spent on creating new public buildings such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some argue that the government should invest money on the conservation and renovations of historic buildings. Others believe that this money will be spent on new public constructions. 

I believe that investing public resources in the conservation of existing buildings can be the better option.  Some of my reasons will be explored in the remainder of this essay and a logical conclusion will be drawn at the end. 

Some constructions are part of the history and identity of people. Firstly, worldwide it is possible to find different buildings associated with relevant historical events. What is more,  many of these are used today as museums or cultural centers to illustrate, the Zocalo in Mexico City is a complex of historical buildings and it is nowadays still used as a cultural and political meeting center.  

Clearly, buildings associated with the roots of citizens should be conserved and for this proposed need of invest money from governments.    

 

Another important point in favor of the conservation of old constructions is the economy. 

To begin with, tourists travel worldwide in order to visit important buildings and museums

In addition, the tourism industry moves thousands of millions of dollars per year and for some regions this is the source of important income. For example,  hundreds of people travel every year to the Yucatan Peninsula in the south of Mexico to visit the ancient ruins and museums. So, investing money in conservation and renovation can be beneficial to the economy of countries and regions. 

In conclusion, I admit that spending public money on creating new public constructions can contribute to urban development, but, renovation and conservation of existing ones should be a priority.",3,5.0
The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that harsher punishments imposed on driving crimes were the sole way to keep roads safe. From my own standpoint, while I agree that this method could be effective in reducing the number of driving offences, there are other solutions available to tackle this situation.

On the one hand, it is true that punishing driving offenders heavily can help improve road safety. Indeed, harsher punishments seem to act as a deterrent to prevent commuters who break  traffic laws from recommitting driving offences. Heavy fines, for example, are extremely useful to target people having financial issues who are unable to pay the fines and, therefore, will follow the traffic rules to avoid being punished. Another typical example is vehicle confiscation which is likely to work well with those depending on their private means of transport to make a living like truck drivers.

On the other hand, I also support the idea that there are other measures which can be adopted to address driving crimes. One feasible solution is setting up a system of surveillance cameras on the main streets, which can effectively hinder would-be driving offenders from breaking traffic laws. In addition, the construction of dedicated lanes separating cars and buses from motorbikes and bicycles appears to reduce the likelihood of unexpected traffic accidents happening between these vehicles. Furthermore, the government imposing an official ban on private cars from travelling to city centres in a certain number of days of a week, like what Greece already did, also allows inhabitants to travel more safely.

In conclusion, it cannot be denied that there are several advantages of heavier penalties; however, national and local authorities can combine them with other solutions to ensure the safety of commuters as much as possible.",9,8.0
‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.
It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.
On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.
In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.",7,7.0
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Traffic congestion is a major concern in metropolitan cities and towns. It increase the time cost of travellers to go to different destinations. However, most urban areas have not yet had the solution to solve this traffic problem.

The popularise phenomenon of car ownership increase the number of cars sharply in these two decades. Lower manufacture cost of producing a car allows the general public to buy a private car at a cheaper price. With the increase of accessibility of private vehicles, more workers tend to drive their cars to work and send their children to school. Consequently, the highways and roads in urban districts are over-burden that they cannot handle such high volume of traffic. Traffic congestion then happens more frequently that the travelling time cost increases.

The deteriorating situation of road congestion urges the government to control the rising number of vehicles. The authority should increase the tax of automobile ownership to reduce the accessibility and affordability of cars. Meanwhile, encouragement on taking public transport such as underground and bus can alleviate the traffic burden especially in the peak hours. Besides, the government can subsidise the public transport to provide a better price of travelling fees to increase the financial incentives of the general public to give up buying a private car. Not only do the price of purchasing a car rise, but also the public transportation fee decline, the traffic problem can be solved.

In conclusion, traffic jam is becoming more serious in the places all around the world because of the large-scale production of private cars. The governments in different nations should take control on the car ownership to prevent further deterioration of transportation problems.",5,6.0
The only way to improve safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Road safety is a more essential and concerning matter. Therefore, a substantial proportion of individuals think that the only way to enhance welfare is to make inflexible rules and regulations because carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. I partially agree with the given statement. Well-being has several other alternative ways to counter this problem.

To commence with, the administration can either make strict constitutions or punish because they cannot do both commodities. Videlicet, when they make laws to tackle road accidents, but it is extremely hard to follow natives. On the other hand, when the authorities are making inflexible punishment. They cannot improve the economy in the correct way. For example, more than two-fifths of natives are died every year due to the usage of smartphones while driving. The fatality rate has massively risen. Thus, governments should take some useful action as compared to make guidelines. It is extremely brutal for the population because it is a sudden stop.

In addition, the fact cannot be denied that several individuals are not well-educated. They do not have proper information regarding harmlessness. For instance, the department of education in the USA revealed that more than one-fifth of inhabitants are not educated, but they should consider or buy cars or bicycles even when it has the proper skill to drive a car. Nevertheless, they have less information regarding regulations. As a result, education is an essential part of an individual's life and leadership should give free coaching to control the mortality rate.

To conclude, unquestionably, when the authority makes strict laws or punishments natives cannot follow the right way. They need to provide higher and quality education to residents.",2,4.5
"Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.",9,8.0
"In recent years, “responsible tourist” have paid attention to preserving both culture and environment of the places they visit. However, some people say that it is impossible to be a “responsible tourist”. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, more and more people travel around other places, it became  trendy. Thus, some people encourage visitors to be  ""responsible tourists"" who protect local culture and the environment. However, it exists some people consider it's difficult to reach the standard of a ""responsible tourists"". Therefore, in the following essay, I will demonstrate my opinion. 

Firstly, the local scenic area has no measurement of the facility to limit people doing some immoral behaviours. For example, if a person carries many litters and he or she wants to alabelon them to a trash can, but there have no trash can so that some people have to alabelon rubbish anywhere. Secondly, it depends on the behaviour habitat of tourists, some tourists have low quality, they will take away some souvenir like stones, soils etc. Meanwhile, we also carve writing or design on trees or walls. Although, these are insignificant things, if millions of people all do that, it leads to enormous destruction.

Moreover, in order to earn more money, the local scenic area management department has no limitation attract people visiting here, it may change the local environment and culture when more and more people visit these place, it will only be a matter of time when these places are contaminated and eventually ruined.

In conclusion, if preserving local culture and ecosystem, the government has to improve management for scenic area, and for individual, we should control ourselves and reduce such impolite action, it will get better and better and we will closer to be a ""responsible tourists"".",6,6.5
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether students should focus on further education in universities and colleges or it is better to let them apply for a job straight after school. In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion. 

Some people tend to think that it is better to continue your education in higher institutions, because of the higher employment opportunities. One of the first things we need to take into consideration is that universities and colleges give you more understanding and knowledge in the sphere you are studying in, that helps you become a better specialist and most of the employers search for well trained workers. For example, nurses and dentists are required to have special training, which can take for about ten years, without it they won’t even be able to become a simple doctor. But not only students of medical specialisations take further education, designers, managers, writers and others do it too, that’s because often students don’t have enough knowledge to start their career, but with the help of professors, they have a lot more chances to become professionals and it will be easier for them to get a job. 

However, others insist that it’s better to get a job, because you can earn money and not spend it on expensive learning. For instance, university prices go higher every year which is not affordable for every family to let their children apply for one, so as we can see from the last trends, it becomes more common for students to start their own business, build career as a photographer, freelancer or etc. and make good money out of it.

To conclude, I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career and improvement students will get is indispensable, but in my opinion it is not a necessity and it would be nicer to put less pressure on those, who have chosen not to take this path and got a job straight after school.",5,6.0
Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything studied at school is useful at some time. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.,"While other people consider that the academy system is a beneficial way to learn more about every literacy. This essay will argue that the scion who is taught at the seminary is just spending much time. Personally, I firmly believe that students are claimed for an important approach rather than some useless subjects. 

To begin with the first thesis, from my perspective on the topic  they would be able to find out valuable information about their children's lives, because, it is a crucial step for their own view. The main reason is that  the government should for herns in order to increase their study as well as interests for learning. For example, teachers should provide  modern equipment to admission as well as encourage pupils for every beneficial part of subjects. As a result, pupils are fascinated by science for their benefit. 

On the other hand, attempting  information in a department is not useful for offspring, it would be a complex way to improve their skills at schools. One of the most controversial issues facing today's world is that teaching methods at institutions is to be complicated for the kids. As more humans know about it not interesting stuff is not necessary for recruitment. As a reason why the educationalists should be considered that it should be an optional program.

To sum up, from my experience for schools that the government has to be it would allow versions for all heir although they think it would be a best optional way for all. In ,addition recruitment also should concentrate on their studies.",7,7.0
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is a fact that students face severe issues to focus on their education in school. It could be due to either malnourishment or inappropriate time management of pupils  and there are adequate measures like ensuring proper supplements can be adopted to alleviate this issue.

Primarily, the malnutrition which adversely affects the learning ability of students by reducing  their proper functions of brain and other vital organs. To illustrate , proper intake of nutritious meal which  contains vitamins and minerals at correct time is mandatory for the development of the intellectual activity  of a student. Apart from this , the impact of visual and social media platforms diverts the attention of students from their studies. To explain , the increased screen time will reduce the characteristics  of the brain to think and concentrate as well as it will lead to making the child lazy and obese due to lack of physical activity. Hence the child feel sleepy and fatigue  during the class hours  and that will gradually lead to learning difficulties.

On the other hand,there are effective steps can be taken to tackle this issue firstly , the parent and teachers have to make sure that the student is getting enough nutrients .To explain, it is the obligation of elders and the government that to support the children who are physically weak by ensuring their adequate food by providing free school meals  . Furthermore , a well-managed time frame for using internet and proper guidance by adults  to control the usage  will be more beneficial.Moreover ,encouraging them  to do more exercise instead of playing online games , so that their blood circulation as well as thinking ability improve and which will enhance their attention in the classroom .

In conclusion, the  weak physical strength and impact of  digital media is affecting the concentration of students in classroom. Whereas, supply of proper food and experienced guidance in using the internet can make a big change in this issue.",5,6.0
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"In recent times, there have been increased awareness of environmental challenges in many countries. It is often argued that a significant measure to address problems in the environment is to raise the price of oil and gas use by automobiles. I support this notion because it will help reduce both traffic congestion on the roads as well as air and noise pollution.
Firstly, a rise in the price of fuel often result in a corresponding decline in traffic on the roads. High gasoline price makes it costlier to maintain cars. Thus, people would choose to use the public transportation system such as trains, ferries and metropolitan buses than personal vechicles. As a consequence, there will be less pressure on the roads, which will limit calls for road expansions that often destroy the ecosystem. If there were no rise in the cost of gasoline for example, there would have been increased agitations for new roads, due to traffic jams with its negative environmental impacts.
Secondly, an important way to reduce noise and air pollution is to make fuel more expensive . This will reduce exhaust and noise because of the reduced volume of cars. Rather than buying expensive fuel, people will seek for sustainable means of transporting themselves. For instance, means such as electric cars and bicycles that produce little undesirable effects on the environment. As a result, there will be a reduction in the deleterious consequences of climate change.
In conclusion, when the cost of fuel for automobiles is increased, there will be reduction in road congestion and pollution, which will go a long way in solving environmental problems. This will ensure a suitable earth conditions for the future generation. ",6,6.5
"Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion)","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS label 8.",9,8.0
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The enthusiasm for famous people is increasingly more in our time by making them always in the centre. Today, celebrities’ glamourous lifestyle and money become more intriguing for the audience than their success stories which create a bad example for a younger generation. This essay will argue that  famous people’s stories affect positively to the younger people.

There is a controversy about some celebrities that whether they deserved to become famous due to their achievements. The reason for this is the most of them being just lucky people for experiencing the overnight fame. Also the lack of qualities for success causes their need to exhibit their excessive lifestyle and became a public figure for the way they live. Indeed, social media influencers are the most obvious example for this category. Sharing their choices and entertainment concept is the attractive element for their fame. Consecutively, there is not much left for famous people to share if they do not have any achievement from the different waves of life.

On the other side real successful people increasingly displays a good example to the young people for their future lives. The attention given to any field massively thanks to the related growth of social media contents. In addition to this, the young learn to appreciate the achievements since they are considered as rare. The positive aspect is born from the envy to the stories of these people. For example, the Report of Children Education done by USA Authorities the 45% of children are eager to learn the difficulties but admire the stories told by qualified interviewees. As a result, celebrities make the rareness of the achievements even more attractive than it was thought before.

This essay argued that the lives of celebrities cause depressing wishes for new generations day by day. I completely agree with the opinion of in today’s world being famous creates a false image for young people by making them desire to have wealth without any hard work, which leads to get disappointed because of  fate.",3,5.0
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"Advertisement is a powerful and persuasive medium that influences consumers in both positive and negative ways. In order to survive in the competitive marketing world, every company believes in advertising its product. Thus, it is undeniably true that advertisements have significant impacts on consumers. In my opinion, I believe that excessive popularity of advertisements has adverse effects, but some measures should be taken to curb this issue.

There is no doubt that advertisements influence people’s minds. Several corporate organizations and local companies use advertisements as a way to promote and provide essential information about their products to the consumers. For instance, there are companies that promote health drinks and immune boosting medicines with the help of top celebrities. These advertisements create an illusion in the consumer’s minds that their health drinks and immune-boosting medicines will help them maintain their immune system and acquire a well-balanced body. Thus, people are swayed by these advertisements and instantly purchase such products. Moreover, the most susceptible target for advertisements is children because they lack the information and maturity to make informed judgments. In this way, they pester their parents to purchase those products. Further, stealth advertising and celebrity endorsements sway people into tempting and purchasing goods that they actually don’t use often.

There are some ways to deal with these issues. First, the government should impose strict laws and regulations on advertising companies to not pressurize the public to purchase unnecessary products. The advertising agencies should be aware of launching ethical advertisements. Furthermore, the consumers should protect themselves from being persuaded by celebrity endorsements.

To sum up, although advertising is an effective way to increase a company’s sales and brand, they are more often than not a negative influence on people’s lives. I believe that governments should exert more regulations on advertising agencies to mitigate the issues mentioned above, and consumers should use their wisdom to purchase only the necessary products without being influenced by advertisements.",4,5.5
"Some people believe that the government 
Should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reason for your answer and include examples from your own experience","Some people believe the the government should finance on social services like retirement pension for adults instead of spending its budget on public services like agent need while others say individually should save their fund during their working years. This essay will delve in the upcoming paragraph and subsequently will explore perspective in turns.

On the one hand, Although I believe government should definitely allocate large part of it's budget on public services. The government economic sector determine overall quality of life, ensuring the basic sector such as school, hospital and roads are available to all the citizen irrespective their income and social states. The public services are needs are primary needs of the society and thus needs proper funding. 

For example, absence of medicine in any country will create significant problems. That's why government should adequately finance on public services in first place. Become old is normal things to everyone however younger citizen are participate important role for the country economic growth.

On the other hand, retire adult are vital part of the every family. Whom encourage their close ones  as well as providing their experiences. I think adult must save their funds during their working years. However old people also are integrate part of the society. Some ancient could save their money but most of old citizen could not save money because of high expenses. I think government should provide free medicine and treatments of low income citizens.

For instance, in Sri Lanka have been provide  free hospital treatments for citizens.

In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, Although I believe government should allocate its budget for argent needs.

However old citizen also crucial part of the society. I think government should implement long term concept for this problem thus if not it becomes huge impact of their life.",2,4.5
Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Nowadays, it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods. However, I personally believe there are more important things than the economy, which governments should pay more attention to. For example, health systems, education, fundamental rights etc. Despite this, in my opinion, production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well-being of the country, to make a balance among all objectives.
On the one hand, countries rely on the economy in order to make money, provide people with jobs and make a way of living. So I believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy. Nevertheless, constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country, as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials. Moreover, the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products.
On the other hand, taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing. Without health, education and values, most nations would not survive. I also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population, as people are the ones that work in production. In other words, both aims complement each other perfectly.
As a conclusion, I would like to highlight the fact that constantly increasing production does not benefit anyone, it also may harm people. And governments should be more aware of other complex issues like the ones mentioned above.",6,6.5
"Some people think the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is commonly believed that a school is a place where people can obtain an education to make a better life.Some people think the main goal of the school is making the children good citizens and workers.However, others feel that improve them as individuals.I personally agree with this opinion and this essay will discuss the reasons and relevant examples to support my viewpoint.

      Advocates of this proposition believe that education gives people knowledge and skills.Also,people  with qualifications are more likely to find work as this way children earn a higher salary and can contribute positively to society.Moreover,Schools aim to teach young people moral values such as tolerance and sharing.For example,school curriculums include respecting teachers as well as junior and seniors through keeping the environment and loving in their life.

      Another factor to consider is the rules of civil behaviour.As a result,it will help to reduce the number of crimes and accidents the case in the country.this still has to teach them to follow  not only the law of the country but also the religion.For instance,today the most developed countries ,this is a fragile place for them in many cases because do not follow the rule and do not maintain discipline.It can be seen in the situations such as littering in public and in many violations of traffic rules and environmental pollution. my opinion is that only an institution can effectively educate these qualities of a nation the offspring from different ages were taught these positive qualities.

In conclusion , I strongly believe that an institution is fully responsible for preparing the children to be good members of a society and make an organized people.",8,7.5
"Some people think that the detailed description of crimes on newspapers and TV has bad consequences, so this kind of information should be restricted in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Among all the controversies triggered by the mass media, perhaps the most common one should be their impact on crime coverage for the public. Some people embrace news on crimes as valuable safety reminders but others warn that they might incite crimes. In my opinion, while certain improvements are essential, restricting reports of this nature in the media should not be considered.

Despite the fact that social media today are increasingly used to attract viewers with threatening and exaggerated information about crimes which might create a bit of chaos in the readers’ minds, such reports still play a significant role in promoting local safety and perfecting legal systems. For example, news coverage often reveals crimes that would have otherwise been ignored or concealed from the public and administrators, igniting fierce discussions among local and online communities. This helps voice public concerns and encourages new regulations to be made. This is how the legal system is improved and safety is further secured.

Moreover, the conventional belief that coverage of crimes helps alert the public to lurking dangers still holds true in the current internet era. With the advancement of the internet, new forms of crime have emerged, which are completely unfamiliar to ordinary people. Online racketeering is a typical example, where a large amount of money could disappear with just a click on a cell phone or a conversation with strangers through smartphone applications. Unfortunately, these scenarios can change in just a few weeks or months, since criminals constantly come up with new swindles. In such cases, social media can never be too focused on updating crime information.

In conclusion, even if reporting on crimes may, to some extent, teach potential criminals, the positive impacts of such reports outweigh the negative impacts, especially in the current fast-changing digital era. However, certain improvements are necessary to ensure that media reports on crimes are accurate, balanced, and do not incite further crimes.",9,8.0
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","It is true that there are getting more people explore the architecture history of their living place in a few countries. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that people using different way to find the story.

In recent years, ‘YouTube’ is a very popular platform, not only famous people can show their videos on YouTube, but also public can upload their daily-life vlog on it. There are many category films we could search on YouTube. For instance, the introduction about home, traveling, and the cuisine programs etc. It may cause a trend which promoted public to deeply know their house. Also, urban renewal program is a reason why more people finding out about the history of their house. Thanks to the program, the house of the owner, who want to record their house before restructuring house. As a result of discussing how the building comes from.

As far as I know, some people got more information from the local residents. Not only asking some questions about the houses, but also living with them for a few days. Some people obtained the data from the documentary record, while the faraway record always less than the latter information. There is doubt that the history of the house is not a simple research that everyone can start with.

In conclusion, if you want to introduce your hometown to others, acquaint your home is the most direct way to be the first step. The more understanding a place, the more touching story you know. So that you will become much cherish the time you live in your house.",3,5.0
"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","During these years it is vital for everyone to provide themselves with accommodation and have enough budget to survive. However, students don't have access to everything they want and they may be proposed by someone to work in their spare time, in order to develop their financial condition. It has demerits and merits that should be discussed in this essay. As far as I am concerned it has more advantages than disadvantages. 

One of the major benefits of part-time jobs is gaining experience and proficiency while working young adults face real difficulties in jobs and learn how to solve them. Especially, when students work by their profession will be useful in their future careers or even in any field. Additionally, it is complicated for young adults to earn money for living and housing facilities, in this ,case part-time employment will help them to earn pocket money to purchase everyday expenses, become more mature and independent and  rent accommodation properly. For example, being an employee in certain companies may assist them with   cultivating self-discipline and managing time and money. Thus, there have been mentioned advantages of part-time employment. 

On the other hand, it can not be denied that mainly the university lessons require full concentration and discipline means while working some students may lose their focus and concentration. Although  absenteeism affects their grades and university life, there can be some factors which lead to exceptions. For instance, a person who studies in the faculty of tourism can not harm anyone, while future doctors who studies medicine and who has a huge impact on others' life should not be absent because of the job. Further, students who work and study at the same time are likely to be under stress and pressure. Hence, there have been listed disadvantages of half time job which affects youngsters' life. 

To recapitulate, having weighed everything I have mentioned above, I would come up with the conclusion that it has both sides and the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",6,6.5
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Society work by the youth in today’s contemporary era is getting on the verge of extinction. It is widely said that teens should devote their free pace to social work which will be benefited  both of them. I completely agree with this notion which I will elucidate in the forthcoming paragraphs.

Firstly, people are more vulnerable to many diseases & hence they need special assistance. Hospitals nowadays, are not only meant for treatment but a place for generating revenue by making fools. Therefore, if most of these diseases should be treated at the home then it will save a lot of money. In doing so, the youngsters of that humanity can also start helping  those patients in their leisure hours. While doing so, it will reflect the culture & values of their families. For instance, in a survey conducted by AIIMS, India,  one of the renowned societies, it has been revealed that the casualty of that association is only 33% compared to some other societies because most of the diseases are being treated within that neighbourhood with the help of humongous youth.

Besides that, these kids are well appreciated by everyone & also rewarded with prizes which motivated them as a whole. Additionally, they also get a chance into politics & win from their locality which is again a positive for that nation. Though it is quite hard to devote our time to social movement as well our daily routine in today’s competitive world  still  gives us immense pleasure & satisfaction in indulging in such activities. Research conducted by The Outlook, a magazine, it is being published that the majority of leaders around 23% are social welfare pupils from well-known societies. 

To wrap up, although it is difficult to balance personal as well as a social exercise ,one should not forget their values & provide their kindness towards humanities. Minor should step forward & start helping  the community in their free moment with only keeping in mind that their efforts will be rewarded by the lord in any other form.",8,7.5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extend do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Climate change is the greatest threaten to the existence of life on earth. Some people suggest that seeking a way to go along with climate change outwiligh prevention of it. Personally, I strongly agree this view and believe we should take bolder action towards it.

Firstly, climate change is detrimental. Researches have proved that climate change will lead to destroy current and future human civilisation. Melting of glaciers and rising of sea level will cause several problems. Due to that problem people will emigrate and lose usefull lands and their homeland. Similarly, extreme weather which has become more frequent in causing droughts. For example, due to defostration quality of air getting worst. Concequently, there will be no plau for us to survive if we dont take steps.

Global warming is the main cause of climate change. If both people and governments tak usefull steps to protect this issue, this can be controlled to be great extent. For example, the governmens should stop the generation of power from fossil fuels which cause more carbon emissions and increase global warming. In addition, green energy as a wind, solar and hydropower can inversted by government.

To conclude, it is clear that global warming and climate change had already started and ongoing, however there is still chance to prevent this issues. Especially, we should present better climate to future generation.",1,4.0
People nowadays tend to have children at an older age. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people believe that it is better to have children later in life because it allows them to better provide, to pass on experience, and also to develop more comprehensively and strive to understand younger generations. Opponents of late childbirth believe that it is harmful to the health of the parent and child. By comparing all possible arguments it is possible to come to a conclusion about who is closer to the truth.

Firstly, having children at an older age can be dangerous for the baby's health, because those born to parents over 40 have a higher risk of genetic conditions like Down syndrome. Children may face health issues related to an increased risk of premature birth, fetal growth restriction, and fetal macrosomia which means high birth weight. Secondly, formerly geriatric pregnancy is also considered a higher risk for patients. These are consequences such as multiple pregnancies and emergency cesarean section.

On the other hand, becoming a parent at a later age allows people to ensure a better financial situation for their children. During pregnancy, people can afford better medical care and nutrition, and while raising children, they can provide them with better education and leisure. In addition, older parents are able to pass on their accumulated knowledge to their children and give them better advice. In turn, the person themself will be able to adopt the thoughts of the younger generation and learn to look at the world more broadly.

Thus, the pros of late pregnancy outweigh the cons, since a healthy 38-year-old could have an easier pregnancy than a 20-year-old due to the availability of funds for good medical care. They will also be able to give more to the child in material and moral terms.",6,6.5
Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead of going directly to the university. What are the advantages and disadvantages?,"In most countries, teenagers often travel or do a part-time or full-time job for a certain period of time before entering the university. The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.
One of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.
There are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.
In conclusion, even though travelling or doing the job for some period gives an opportunity to have work experience and a small saving, downsides to this is showing an interest for earning money rather than continuing study further.",6,6.5
Young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that criminals that are minor should undergo the same treatment as adult criminals and, this essay shares the same opinion with their argument.

To begin with, there are some negative points in that argument. First and foremost, underage criminals might not fully understand the consequences of their crimes. To be specific, it is wrong to commit a crime in the first place but, there is a big difference between people committing a crime despite fully understanding the impact of crime and who do not. Underage criminals, considering their immature nature, are more likely, in the latter group. Moreover, It can be harsher punishment compared to adult criminals. To elaborate, younger criminals have more days to live after the punishment and, it would be difficult for them to be employed considering their formal convict status.

However, there are also some positive points to the argument. Firstly, the age of criminals does not change the severity of crimes. There is a reason for the Justice system installed a statue with a blindfold. It represents the just system should be fair and equal. Secondly, it can be unfair to the victims of the crime. For instance, there would be a situation where people who lost their family member to a minor might have to watch the convict gets away with relatively weak punishment.

In conclusion, there are some positives and negatives to the statement. Nevertheless, this essay argued that because of the fact that justice needs to be fair to all, youger criminals should be treated in the same way as adult criminals.",6,6.5
"In cities and towns all over the world the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","In today's modern world, one of the controversial issues among people is  traffic. In many societies, the high level of traffic has become widely common. In my opinion, traffic  originated from the high level of population and low demand for using public transport.Below, some solutions are presented.

One of the most important reasons for the high rate of traffic in cities and towns is the population.A majority of people prefer to live in cities and towns because of more equipment.So, the amount of population is increased significantly.For example, every year new students enter  cities because of their universities or some workers would be entered because of their job offers. In addition, most of them have  a family that they need to go to school , jobs and purchases.

The second important reason that causes the traffic  in cities and towns is that most people prefer to use a private car and also , some of them have different cars. As a result, many cars are in the streets and will be faced the traffic.

For solving this problem,this situation should be changed.Firstly, the government should be announced to people  the negative effects on the population by holding workshops or news and also should set  rules for using  private cars in busy times. Secondly, the government should be encouraged people for using public transport. Furthermore, people can use bicycles or walk during  busy times.

In conclusion, for the number of reasons mentioned above, I believe that traffic is the result of the high rate of population and a low rate of using public transport that the government by setting a useful rules can control this situation.",5,6.0
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree","There is no doubt these days, news is one of the most important parts in our modern life. However, the question is, are we wasting our time when read the newspaper or follow it on television? In this essay I am going to argue that.

There are many people believe that, news is connecting to their lives. Firstly, follow news programmes is important to know what is going on the world and to be knowing what happens around them. In fact, they could be informed if there is any crisis appear in the earth such as, nowadays the COVID 19 has spared in the whole world. Moreover, business men require to be attentive about the economic news also political disaster, because the policy has relation with the economy, if any political disaster happens to the world, it will affect strongly in the international economy, so business men will run to buy anything that its price was affected. There are some other things to make following news being as this important.

On the other hand, many individual think that watching news let them to loss their time. In addition, many of them believe that if they read books instead of watching news, it might be more useful and that could return to them significant knowledge. For instance, they think that while the news programmes are discussing and sharing the news they could finish two chapter of their book.

To sum up, this essay has argued that if is watching news will let them to loss their moment. In my opinion, watch news will not let you to waste of your time and maybe that make you attention what is going on around you and about your country",7,7.0
Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"These days the space exploration is not just an imagination since human beings landed and step their foot on the moon decades ago. In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.
On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
On the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view I strongly believe that space companies such as SpaceX must try to find a new resources to visit other planets. However, I agree that they should be done after providing the basic needs of the human on earth and investing to solve poverty and any other human tragedies.",6,6.5
"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In recent times, the Internet has gradually substitute books for the purpose of knowledge storage. Although I am apprehensive  about the repercussion accompanied by the benefits, I believe the upside of this trend outweighs the downside.

The Internet is advantageous as a major medium of knowledge from various perspectives. First and foremost, people are released from carrying heavy paper books around and able to access without geographical boundaries anytime from their compact devices. This has a profound impact on pupils, especially those in their formative years, whose physical developments are no more hampered by the burden on their shoulders. Also, with the enormous amount of information available online, it only needs few clicks on search tools to precisely locate the citation we are looking for. Wikipedia as a salient example provides the expertise of all fields free to the public. 

On the other hand, the dismissal of printing, binding and distribution of paperbacks though save great deals of time and financial cost contributes to several outcomes. The most evident is the quality of information on websites. The craze of blogs and social media platforms, for instance, lower the gate for publishing ideas. While publishing books cost a fortune and only reliable contents will be invested by a publisher, a lot of web output lack reviews and peer checks. Furthermore, despite the limitations of a printed book, pirating becomes rampant and erodes the livelihood of academic researchers and creators in all realms. 

In conclusion, while gaining the conveniences of new media of know-how, the government and the public should be aware of the risk of unfair spreading of illegal and incompetent contents on networks and take bolder action to protect intelligent property.",11,9.0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In recent years, most individuals say that students should be given permission to give a reputation to their teachers, even in a critical way in order to boost educational quality. Whereas, the protester argues that this trend will break the barrier between learners and educators, which result in disrespect and bad behaviour. This essay will shed some light on both vỉews with a personal viewpoint

On the one hand, there are several reasons why it can be argued that students who are given permission to assess the teachers could lead to a lack of respect and discipline in the classroom. Firstly, as young pupils are immature, impulsive and inexperienced, they could easily give negative words to teachers when it comes to controversial issues. For instance, students could give a wrong answer for a Math exercise, but insist that they are right, and this lack of knowledge could make them lose their temper and criticize their teachers. Secondly, the class may be in chaos due to the massive number of comments. Opinions can vary from student to student, and it is impossible for educators to find out the best way that satisfies all the students.

On the other hand, I believe that giving students the freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings to teachers could enhance the quality of education. Perhaps the principal reason is that this interaction could boost students’ critical thinking and particularly ensure the level of comprehension. For example, the teachers may teach too fast that pupils are not able to understand; in this case, thanks to learners’ responses, educators could adjust their speeds and methods so that pupils could fully retain the knowledge. Another reason is that this approach could improve teachers’ pedagogical skills. The lecturer who does not carefully prepare the content of lessons may provide wrong information, and feedback from students could help them find out their mistakes.

In conclusion, I would contend that encouraging pupils to judge their teachers could lead to increased educational quality despite the possibility of disrespectful and undisciplined attitudes among students.",8,7.5
