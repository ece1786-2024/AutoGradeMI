Some people think news has no connection to the people lives. So it is a waste of time to read the news in newspaper and watch television news program. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"In conclusion, increasing payouts to employees can help motivate them for the short term, and this comes at a cost to the business; a better way to keep them focused, determined and more productive at work is to introduce increment policies based on their performance which can be given to them in the form of an annual bonus. Other non-monetary incentives like recognition of one's work through awards, such as ""Employee of the Month"", can also keep the organizations' workers motivated at no extra cost to companies.",0
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Criticism may seem as both a benefit, as well as a degoratory for teachers. Some teachers may accept the advice as a means to improve their teaching standards while some may take it as a rude gesture.Some may argue that Criticism may be a rude form feedback while some may say its a positive aspect to make changes.

Criticism, also known as a valuable feedback is usually more accpeted in the western cultures where being able to express a point of view is largely accepted. In western countries. Children in western society are raised to have a voice, to share their thinking. Teachers have also adapted a wider mindset to accept most feedback positively

In comparison to the asian culture, where teachers are known for the scholarly knowledge. The teachers words and method of educating the students are usually taken and rarely questioned. Remarks are usually frowned upon and would be classifies as a lost of respect and discipline.

In my opinion, criticism should be taken in a positive way and improvement should be made in place to  ensure that both the teacher grows in his career as well as self developtment.",0
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that it is possible to resolve a part of environmental problems if the cost of fuel for the personal and commercial transport will significantly increase. I particularly agree with this statement and in this essay, I will try to explain why. 

On the one hand, burnable fuel it is the main resource of energy in modern world, and the cost of the fuel has a great impact for the cost of food and goods, hence people try to save their money what extend to conscious consumption of the fuel and more effective logistic ways. Therefore, the fuel economy is decreased amount of the pollution to the environment which has a positive influence on the nature. Moreover, cost of fuel extends to developing of advanced technology and it is a fact that modern cars have a less exhaust of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than earlier. For example, Scandinavian countries stimulate people to keep the fuel economy policy and to have modern vehicles by way to cancellation of taxes to the owners of cars with zero emissions. 

On the other hand, increasing the cost of the fuel in poor countries, could stimulate people to use mo cheaper and dirtier fuel, which only increases air pollution.",0
"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.

You should write at least 250 words.","The schools are actually preparing the children to get academically strong and to pass the exams ultimately. This is the actual happening schools. the schools should also take steps to teach about cookery, dressmaking and woodwork.

I ultimately disagree the phrase. The school is the primary education of children, it should not be end just like that. The reason to disagree the phrase is that, the children are in need of extra curricular activities like cookery, dressmaking and woodwork. They can learn it even from their family and friends. But schools are the apprpriate place to learn all things.

For instance, there are two people in the same business concern. They two are only good at academically. So they need to find and recruit more employe for other activities like billing and computerised works. If the school were taught them the extra-curricular activities they may be sucseed in their buisiness without finding and recruiting more employees from outside.

To conclude, only knowledge from academic is not fully enough for students to sucseed in their life. The more they focus on academic success and passing examinations, the more they tend to fail hardly. so finally i strongly disagreeing the phrase Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends.",0
Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help prevent illness and diseas. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"The line graph above illustrates the average number of passengers which use London Underground Station in a day.

Overall, the chart indicates that the station is open from 6 am in the morning to 10 pm in the night. There are two peak times that show a considerable number of passengers, whereas some intervals show a few people.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Polluted environment is an ongoing dilemma in the modern world these days and it is conspicuous to see that increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. Tackling this issue is challenging, especially given the speed of social change and the pressure of modern life. Therefore, this essay will explicate some key reasons why environment is polluted and will suggest a range of possible measures that can be taken to improve/change the situation and highlight probable knock-on effects of polluted environment. 

A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that lot of companies did not treat the drainage properly. The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because the modern drainage was not installed by this company, and they threw all the industrial waste into the water causing water pollution in this area. Thus, it is no surprise to see that there is rise in producing consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

Improvements to polluted environment can be achieved in a variety of ways, strict management of dischargement is one of the most favourable and note-worthy choice. To elaborate, government should be controlled strictly and only allow which company to have environmental protection standards so they never can throw their trash which are harmful to the environment into the atmosphere. This can improve the situation by controlling the amount of industrial waste to environment and encouraging recycle waste. Thus, while there can be other steps to be taken, this can be considered to be a good start towards declining the damage to the natural environment caused by manufacturing consumer goods.",1
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, individuals are need to earn more income to fulfil their requirements therefore they do not need to pay taxes to the government. I strongly agree with the above statement and my justification will come in further paragraphs along with some relative examples.

To commence with, there are several reasons why human beings not need to pay taxes. Firstly, they put extra hours and hardwork to earn money hence they should keep all the money for their better future. For instance, sometimes any misshepling occure that time they easily used their saving for any medical emergency and many more. Secondly, the living expenses of todays lives are very costly to adjust middle class to buy their dream house and car. Thirdly, education system and helathcare both are very expensive to affordable poor people therefore they do not need to pay the government.

Furthermore, individuals are less likely to pay taxes to the administration and used their saving in different fields such as education, healthcare and many more. Moreover, they need to some essential requirements in their life to survive long.

On the other hand, there are many advantages of paying taxes to the state. the government can easily provide them better education, good health infrastrure any many more facilities. Additionally, the state can manage their economy and budget very easily with the help of the money which they received from the local public.

To give an overview, folk should not pay taxes to the government because they need some extra money to survive long. However, the state should overcome taxes rates so all people can easily pay taxes.",1

what are the reasons for this ?

how can people research this ?","In some countries, many people are becoming aware of figure it out about background of the home or bulding they live in.

In this essay the reasons and how individuals can research bout the history of home will be discussed.

It is argued that people more and more are intrested in background of the house that they are own, abviously, because they want to know about a perivous owner,include, what job they had or what kind of people they were, for instance, they want to know if they are living in safe place, that means previous owner was a drug dealer,and they have to protect their family from danger and they customers might come back for drugs. as a result, it is not something acceptable.

furthermore, they want to discover that what is the history behind the home a crime happend in the home or not.

"In some countries celebrities complain about the way media
 publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as a part of their fame.do you agree or disagree?","Being a celebrities, their life is an open book to the public, therefore it is common that most of them do not have privacy at all. How it affects them on how they live? In this essay, I will discuss in details why I agree that well known people cannot live freely. 

To begin with, the celebrities are role models that people are idolizing and fantasizing them. Some of them are acting what the community want to see. They need to be pretty, well mannered and glamorous for them to be loved and accepted. Nowadays, because of social media people are easy to access them, thus they can follow them and some can be connected to them. In addition, it is true that anyone can publicise them with a photo or video that can be taken on their mobile phones. By that, they can post it without the permission of that individual, thus invading their privacy. 

Furthermore, some individuals are making this for living, such as, they are selling pictures and videos to the publishers, they are callig them papparazzis. They are famous and popular because they are making the news about them whether it is good or bad. But some of them are trying to ignore and live their lives, however there are still victims of being published. It causes depression, stress and even danger not only in their lives but also to their families. 

In conclusion, being popular can be beneficial but it is more",1
"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","With rapid development of technology, people nowadays using the internet in various way. This essay will discuss factors contributing to this trend about store knowledge in the internet rather than books and why I think it is a good thing.

There are several reasons I suggest to store knowledge online brings many benefits. Firstly,people may solve their problem conveniently and immidiately by just searching the internet. It even being a common phrase that ""If you have question, just google it"", the only thing what people need to do, is snap their question on mobile application or laptop then they can find the answer easily.

Secondly,  it made a good method to develope education system in rural area or the third countries. Many years ago children may need buy expensive books for their studies in schools, but nowadays as this copies of lesson's materials are storaged on crowd, enhencing young communities who live in an inconvinient enviroment to get knowledge in a easiler , cheaper way.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages if people store knowledge on internet, as much as information released online even what things actually are wrong, people may believe this wrong information easily if they are lack of avidence to support the truth. Therefore people suggested the government should build up a group to identify these information are true or wrong when those spreaded online.

As discussed aboved, nowadays people can grab the knowledge from internet so easily, it caused by new edge technology,x Although it may bring people to know something acutally not true, but peosonally I think it is controlable so I belive it is a good trend.",1
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this?","Real estates are given a huge press. Nowadays, one of the most popular subjects among families and landlords is about the history of their house. There might be some reasons toward this question that cause numerous discussions.

Initially, a sense of mystery is very influential among people. Due to disparate types of horror movies, individuals have a severe tendency to acquire more data about their future house, in advance. Further, some of the crowds are deter than their shelter might be hunted or a bad incident might happen in the past. As a result, gathering new information is very significant for these groups.

Apart from people’s believe in superstitions, some parts of the society utterly believe that if you could have this chance to live in a place that was belong to a well-known person, it will give them a sense of precious which is very significant for individuals who are obsessed with showing themselves off.

Besides all the mentioned reasons, there could be some ways for searching about the history of the house. For instance, asking older generations who are wiser and have more experience could be beneficial. Asking old people about information might be more helpful than searching on the internet which might be ubiquitous these days, but is not utterly trustworthy.

Overall, it is crystal clear that there might be myriad reasons for tenants to research about the history of their house. It could be helpful if they really keen on this matter and it will help them be proud of their accommodation. Last but not least, asking old habitants about the history rather than searching on the internet is not only more helpful, but also could be more informing.",1
Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Now in these days, technology is at its boom. Because of, communication is part of technology, Consequently, communication is also at its boom and wide spread.  Actually, there are many free communication means have became widespread. For instance, Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, telegram etc.


Firstly, to discuss the advantages, many, who were disconnected for years with their friends and relatives, are connected now. Actually, It is bringing close to family, friends and relatives and making the strong bonding between each other. Thus, we can discuss, learn and can grow together. In present scenario, because of this lockdown, students cannot attend the college. But, online classes are going on now. For example, I left India and went abroad for my bread and butter. Even though, I was far away from India, thanks to communication, that, I was in touch with ALL and was connected. 


There are some disadvantages also are there with the latest communication. For instance, Vmate, and some other dating sites are causing people to have cross relationship. Also, sometimes even the married couple is getting trapped into, by entering various different sites into bad relationships.


Finally, to conclude it is up to us, how we utilise it.",2
A lot of old people are suffering from lonliness these days. They also lack physical fitness. What do you think are the reasons for this problem. Can you think of some possible solutions.,"Nowadays a number of old people experience anxiety and prefer living in solitude rather than expressing their fears. As a result, they keep away from crowded areas, seldom stepping out for any physical activities thus spending a majority of their time indoors. Two of the majors reasons could be addiction to social media and age related problems. Two of the possible solutions are to disconnect from the virtual world and spend some time in the real world along with indulging in some light physical activities.

These days people spend most of their time surfing social media sites and crave validation along with trying to compare their lives with others. If they are lacking certain beauty standard or skills that are portrayed online many go into depression and isolate themselves from the world thus resulting in loneliness. Recently, the trend of body size zero is gaining popularity all over the internet and those aiming to achieve it resort to unhealthy methods such as harmful dieting or extreme exercise routine. People failing to keep up with these trends consider themselves to be failures and sometimes even contemplate suicide as they are unable to keep up with the pressure.


 
An important solution is to restrict the time spent online and meet and interact with more people around. Time limit should to be set for accessing social media and outdoors activities should be given paramount importance. According to a recent study many people felt less depressed and revitalized when they went for a jog or run as the fresh air and boost in blood flow increased their energy. Moreover, participating in outdoor activities helps you meet new people and enables you to share ideas and strategies for the well being of the team.

To conclude, the realms of your life is in your hand and no one can change your life but you! It is never too late to bring about a change in lifestyle and with the right amount of dedication and persistence anything is possible.",2
"Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animals species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation.

Discuss both sides and give an opinion","Human activity  in every manifestation has a harmful effect on our planet and environment. And the very important and an integral part of our climate system are plants and animals. Everything in our ecosystem has to exist in  harmony. 

 I believe that it is never too late to change something , and we can improve the situation if all the people  work together.  The major problem is that  many humans do not understand that they can change everything only with a few simple measures. For example, people do not have to change their lives to not disturb wildlife, they just must follow the rules like do not drop litter everywhere, use the sorting containers and in forests keep noize to a minimum and  not light a fire.

 I absolutely agree that we are able to change the situation with endangered species of plants and animals, if we  take effective action. Many problems with  wildlife are related to  climate change and global warming. Furthermore, it can be applied to natural disasters such as drought, flood , earthquakes  etc. These catastrophes have a harmful impact on plants and animals, but  all these casualties are caused by human activity, not just by one person. Nowadays, still   industrial companies which are not sustainable enough. They damage our environment and wildlife by exhaust fumes , dumping waste into the ocean and using fossil fuels. 

In conclusion, while the companies mislead the world about their sustainability, eco-friendly organisations such as ""Greenpeace"" can save our planet and wildlife, but if all people  work together we can improve the situation much  faster and easier.",2
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, an attention has been dercreasing in students, which is manifested that students are going far away to their studies. I will discuss what the problems are occured and how to solve it in upcoming paragraphs. 

First and foremost problem mental system an imblance. Student who allows to use computer for online courses, but they are used for their personal things which will helpful to distract from academic focus. Thus, they felling anxiety, depression and lack confidence during exam time. Secondly,  to getting failure. If students are not understood about importance of study or due to lack of  motivation  , they failed to engage their interest in study. Furthermore, some factors are responsible to impair concentration such as lack of sleep, inadequate nutrition and fast paced media environment, which making sustained attention more challenging. 

Solutions are working as key parts of very problems. To overcome mind problem, teachers and parents have to pay attention during student learning time like, block gaming websites, encouraging healthy lifestyles and providing assistance with organizational skills. Moreover,  teachers have to introduce to students about implementation of mindfulness and concentration training in school programs  which will help students improve their focus an dattention spans, for that students are interesting in study. In addition, governments have to make some complimentory nutrient food samples, so that poor students get food without any cost and also introduce to parents about how nutrions food and healthy lifestyle are important for students to represent seminars. 

In conclusion, Teachers and parents have to work on students about pay attention to their studies, which will help for student to acheive goals.",2
Some people think that the teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. they believe this would benefit both the teenagers and society as a whole.,"Youngsters are the building blocks of the nation and they play an important role in serving the society because at this age they are full of energy not only mentally but physically also. some people think that youth should do some voluntary work for the society in their free time and it would be beneficial for both of them. I agree with the statement. it has numerous benefits which will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, they could do a lot of activities and make their spare time fruitful. first of all, they can teach children living in slum areas because they are unable to afford education in schools or colleges. as a result, they will become civilized individuals and do not indulge in antisocial activities. by doing this they could gain a lot of experience and becomes responsible towards the society. it would be beneficial in their future perspective.

In addition to this, they learn a sense of cooperation and sharing with other persons of the society. for instance, they could grow plants and trees at public places and this would be helpful not only to make the surrounding clean and green but reduce the pollution also to great extent. moreover, they could arrange awareness programmes in society and set an example among the natives of the state. this will make the social bonding strong between the individuals and this will also enhance their social skills.

In conclusion, they can “kill two birds with one stone” because it has a great advantage both for the society and for the adolescents. both the parents, as well as teachers, should encourage the teens to take part in the activities of serving the community in their free time.",2
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?","In this cut throat competition, every person wants to become a rich and wealthy. So some would like to do job in their teenage life, whereas some people wants to get proper knowledge in some particular field. I would like to mention here that both the opinion is good as so many people are well known without getting a bachelors degreedegree. But in my opinion education is key for success.

Firstly, Nowadays, as I mention education is required for success and for a better future. Because if you have any degree then you can simply apply for the position and then you have an option of showing your talent or any extra skill which might lead you to the upper position but if you do not have degree then this not an easy task.  Secondly, there is immense benefit of doing university and college like, at the age of 20 person have enough maturity to decide which is the right path and suitable to his/her skill. In addition, person becomes a focus-oriented as he/she already spent 3-4 years in one field so, they started admiring so many people from their field and they got confidence to do the hard workwork. 

Thirdly, as per recent trend so many colleges and university students get direct placement in there final year, so without even wasting a single day they have job offer and they can start earning. Also, some courses have compulsory internship and sometimes they got an opportunity to work in a multinational company so they got enough experience as well in their field although they got very less money in the form of stipend still it worth after one year of completion when they get job offer with good package.

However, the phenomenon of doing job directly after school is faltering but there are so many successful people in the world whose earning is way more than educated person. For example Sachin Tendulkar, who know as a God cricket, he doesn't have any degree after ten, but his firm determination and hard work made him number one in his field. AS well as so many people wants to join their parents' business and don't want to waste their three or four in education. One signal paper cannot decide your future, just like that if you give 100% in any field and do constant hard work you can get success.

Nutshell, I would like to say that there are enormous benefits if you get a proper degree and tad benefit if you do not have proper degree but still no one can stop you from becoming a successful if you give your heart and soul in a particular fieldfield.",2
"Some people believe that time spent on television and computer games can be valuable for children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been a contentious argument over the effect of watching TV and playing computer games on children. This essay examines both points of view and my perspective, being that these activities can be beneficial if the time spent is in moderation. 

 Some hold a firm belief that watching television and playing games on  computers have various benefits. Firstly, these sources of entertainment can enhance  brain development. By interacting with the world through those technologies, either real or artificial, their brains’ functions including spatial-visual reasoning can be boosted subconsciously. Furthermore, after a heavy workload of studying, students should find a stress reliever to provide an escape from information overload, therefore, those kinds of entertainment can be extremely suitable for these situations. 

 However, others raise voices of disapproval by stating that those leisure activities can have a negative influence on their children. This is because of the excessive amount of time spent on playing video games, which eventually leads to addiction. Nowadays the advancement of these sources of vast media has been to the extent that once young and impressional people take part in, they will grow an instant interest, henceforth, it is hard to stop to do other work such as dealing with homework or reviewing the lessons. To illustrate, a single episode of a popular drama film tends to last 1 hour, let alone a whole season; whereas ,in contrast, students only have few hours to both relax and prepare for the next school day.

 To conclude, both sides have their own merits. However, from my ,perspective I am inclined to the opinion that playing computer games and watching TV has great advantages for the youngsters as long as time is spent moderately.",9
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.
Discuss both views and write your own opinion.","People have lots of standpoints whether the modern world makes us dependent on each other or it makes us more independent. While other people said this dependency has increased day by day, I believe that people are more monotonous and stronger these days. 

On the one hand, some people advocate that we are more dependent on each other because of modern technologies. Nowadays, the use of technologies has become convenient as it always provides the right solution and answers. So, people become more dependent on them. For example, if people have problems and difficulties, they start to find them on Google first. They do not try to solve the problems by themselves and depend on the internet. Moreover, due to the hectic and busy lives that most families lead, they are always dependent on each other to support them from head to toes even if they have minor problems.  For instance, the parents want to have a great family lifestyle and they have to work harder to fulfil this achievement. Therefore, they need  support from their grandparents for their children's care in order to concentrate on their work. 

On the other hand, technologies have developed day by day, people are more well-informed and open-minded thinking independently than in the past days. To illustrate, in the past days, the students need parents' help to fill the forms and other necessary things for enrolment for their schools. In this modern world, students can find those things on the internet and can do it well themself without  help from their parents. In addition, in the past, people usually get married around their twenty and even earlier. These days, people are likely to have an independent life and want to enjoy more single space before getting married.

To summarize, it is true that we do depend on others sometimes, however, we always solve our problems and are more independent in this modern world and experience a more thriving life which makes them more confident in their personality.",9
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Lately, the tax payers are wondering where their money goes and they believe that their money is not well invested. As a result, some argue that they should not pay any taxes to the government. I totally agree with this approach and I will explain the reasons why.

The aim of the taxes is to contribute economically to the developments of the communities. A significant part of the citizens salary is taken in order to keep parks clean, to build new roads, schools and hospitals. In addition, this wage is used to support people who do not have an income or a place to live. Some public services like the police and the fireman get their support for it. Without this system these services might fail. For example, police cars, defensive equipments and salary come from the tax money. 

However, although the money of the taxes is essential for these aspects, the tax payers argue that their money is not well invested. Despite of the big amount of fund generated from the taxes, some communities and services do not witness any single improvements or investments. Public sectors like education and health presence a dismiss from the government. These sectors barely survive with the capital provided by the government. Moreover, some presidents spend the tax money to travel and for their personal benefit. Furthermore, people are paying an excessive amount of money in taxes regardless their low salary income. As a consequence, their income after paying taxes is not sufficient to afford their daily expenses.

In conclusion, the tax payment should be waived, if the money is not invested in the community. In the future, it is pretty likely that more people become poor because tax payments.",9
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that voluntary work should be compulsory for teenagers to get benefits from both the individual and society as a whole. I completely disagree with the opinion and think that we should not force the youths to do unpaid work.

First of all, I believe that imposing the ounpaid work on the teenager can cause more burden on them for their studies, which may pit adverse effect on their health too. As we know, there is a lot of syllabus in school; However, after coming back from school, young ones have to do their homework with numerous assignments and projects at home. Whenever they get leisure time, we should encourage them to utilize that period by doing physical exercise and playing sports otherwise, they may become unhealthy. For instance, In Canada, the students who are working in stores have been seen showing less progress in studies as compared to those who do not need to work. That is why Instead of compelling them to work, we should be given the time to concentrate on studies to accomplish outstanding grades.

At the same time, so do not believe that society and teenagers would gain any advantage by doing unpaid work.  It would be unfair for youngsters and society to do anything without their willingness, as it can lead to resentment amongst young people who would feel that they were being used. Furthermore, it is also against our democratic rules of the nation, which would increase the rate if crime in countries. For example, it has been seen that forcefully work causes rebellious in youths which put a negative effect on our society. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system. 

To conclude, I strongly believe that volunteer work should not be mandatory for teenagers because it badly effects on their education and even on our society.",9
Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree),"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what label 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, it seems more important for employers to consider the job applicant’s social skills before their academic records. In my opinion, I strongly disagree as not always good social skills are enough to complete a task satisfactorily, as well as having academic qualifications are not a guarantee of dealing with the job appropriately. I believe that the combination of both aspects should be the best criterion in order to select an employee.

To begin with, employing people based only on their social skills would probably be insufficient as they may not be well prepared to do the job. For instance, it has been claimed that, far away from being overrated, university studies are necessary for  society as many people are being formed in short Online courses trying to take faster paths to get a job while the truth is that 90% of them fail getting hired as they profiles are not enough to deal with all the situations of qualified jobs. This means that it is absolutely necessary having reliable qualifications that allow one to work professionally. However, I am not saying that only  academic records are enough, we all definitely need to have acceptable social skills if we really want to succeed in a working environment.

On the other hand, considering the other extreme of only taking into account their academic records it also does not guarantee successful employment. For example, it has been proved that numerous business sales with competent personnel that were not kind enough at the time of dealing with people, were losing sales dropping their numbers considerably. This explains why it is important to understand that qualifications and social skills contribute equally to the performance of  a better job.

In conclusion, employers who think that it is preferable having great social skills than to have professional skills are wrong, as considering one on top of the other, no matter which one is,  would decline in failure as both are truly important. In my opinion, I strongly believe that employers should consider both aspects in order to choose the best candidates,  which the criteria would be performing a good job while using their social abilities to interact with other employees and clients, working naturally as a part of a team.",9
"""The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?""","With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.

First and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens.",9
"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",4
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business.  Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is believed that climate change can cause negative effect on business in some ways while others think that there are some benefits for business. This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.
	On the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.
	On the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.
	In conclusion, although climate change can impact some drawbacks to the business, there are brighter sides that people can rely on to benefit their business.",4
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Owing to the advancement of technology, more and more educational institutuions are offering online courses. As a result, students are given additional freedom in different aspects. In this essay, I will elaborate on why I believe that this is a positive development and outline main benefits.

To begin with, the opportunity to attend lectures on the internet platforms istead of inperosn, contributes to a solution of the main struggle of nearly every student, financial strain. Namely, having classes on campus is followed by few costs which can be easily avoided by simply staying at home, including all transportation fees and expenses of eating out for instance. This may seem insignificant, but when compounded, it usually cause headaches to both, pupils and families. Hence, without a need to visit a university, student might save a considerable sum of money on a yearly basis. 

Moreover, attending educational institution is frequently highly time consuming, especially for the learners who live further away. Not only the transportation can take you a lot of time but it leaves you  nearly none freedom for the time management. In other words, opportunity to organise your day to a little detail, including meal breaks, lecture time or leisure activities, leads to higher productivity and consequently more free time. Therefore, the less strict the time-table is, the more enjoyable the individual will find studying.

In conlusion,  I am of the opinion that off campus education is strongly advantageous and thus the positive development. Hopefully, more universities will offer such programmes in the near future.",4
Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Humans, plants and animals are living together on the earth. What humans do on the earth will always be related to plants and animals. That is a living cycle. Some of them are  a good relationship, such as  doing a plat and animal conservation. On the other hand, there are also  bad relationships, such as opening the forest to make a new plantation. It will damage the plant and animal species in the forest.  

In  recent years, there are a lot of impacts on human activities. Many people think that is no option to do anything, except do  extreme action to change the condition to get better. The reason is the age of the earth is getting older, and the damage to the environment can not be acceptable anymore. The more things to do will just cost some money spent unuseful.

On the other hand, Taking  effective action is reasonable and easy to implement. There is still  hope to develop the earth condition. Since, the environment adapts well to the recent situation. There are still a lot of things to do, such as publish regulations to protect the environment. Bring to the jail everyone who damage the plant and animal species.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with the opinion of taking  effective action to protect the plant and animal species to develop the situation. It will give a change even a little.",4
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done solve this problem?,"Nowadays, more products which are consumed rapidly are manufactured, and as a result, the ecosystem is facing a severe problem. At the same time, however, there is some uncertainty as to the causes of this trend and its measures. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the debate to seek a conclusion.

To begin with, consumers tend to buy an excess quantity of items even when they already have enough to use and throw them away after years of hoarding. For instance, some young girls hoard facial masks and lipsticks, but never use them before treating them as rubbish. Moreover, by producing various goods that can be consumed the manufacturers can profit significantly. However, in the process of making the products there are chemicals emitting into the air and rivers which will pollute the atmosphere and water. In addition, as the technology of inventing and updating electronic devices is improving, digital items are updated more and more quickly which cost numerous natural resources.

On the other hand, there are some steps that can be taken to resolve these problems. Advertisings which persuade customers to buy things should be under supervision. Also, governments can broadcast some videos against consumerism, raising the awareness of the public. Furthermore, laws and regulations on the manufacturing industry should be created to protect the environment.

To summarize, there is no doubt that producing consumer items can bring serious ecological damages. At the same time, however, governments, manufacturers and advertising enterprises can take measures to reduce the influences. In the final analysis, one can conclude that governments bear the main responsibility to protect the environment in this kind of production.",4
Nowadays many job seekers are finding jobs that force them to move for from their family and friends. Is it a positive or a negative trend? What can be done about it?,"Recently, long-distance jobs have society's attention even if they have to neglect their loved ones. Although this type of work offers a higher salary, the employer will have to face drawbacks in the mentality.

On one hand, an occupation that requires travelling long routes, and immigration usually offer a high salary to support the potential workers' new living conditions, and transportation fees. As said, it is a positive opportunity for those seeking  a well-paid position as it too provides the opportunity in travelling abroad or out of boredom, and learn new things. For example, being a professor in Australia is around 10 times paid more than in Thailand. Not only does it delivers great income but, it besides gives us chances to acquire new knowledge and experiences. Thus, those who seek this job kind still eager to be able to raise their family well afterwards. 

On the other hand, it can be negative, as someone may neglect their family and friends to keep consistent with work where they believe can bring their goals. Therefore, the workforce should provide a clear timeline to be a part of their well-being both mentally, and physically to let job seekers well justify their work-life balance. For instance, full-time jobs in the long-distance are evident that workers need to be occupied in the office for years consecutively. Since work performance is associated with a worker's psychological being and interpersonal skills which are likely to decline on a bad day. Hence, providing a gap time is considered important for the condition, especially for those who emigrate. 

In conclusion, because of a better income, and experience of jobs that comes with moving far apart attract job seekers could be both positive and negative. Providing a clear forecast suitably for potential workers is seen as essential to prevent undesired outcomes.",4
Some people say that advertising has positive economic effects. Others think it has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"There are oppsing views on the impact of advertising,some people argue It has benificial with economic.However,other claim that would effect social in the negative way bacause people will feel dissatisfied when other have and they don’t have.In my view,I believe it has positive way in ecnomic,while undoubtedly it also has disadvantages in social.

Advertising is the major way for modern companies to advertise their product to consumers.It can let comsumer have a first impact about their’s product then comsumer would buy it when shopping in supermarket.In fact,research supposed people will prefer to buy product that have seem before rather than not.Futhermore,it provide widely type of products to consumer,so they can buy their favour product.Besides that,advertising is a profesional skill so company should engage employee who can plan a good advertisment.As a result,it provide a lot of job opportunities.

On the other hand,advertisment can crete a gap in society.The people who can afford the product which in advertisment will feel superior and look down people who can’t afford it.For instance,the reason of regulate school uniform is demolish the difference between student,and prevent student had been racist by other.As the result,those that cannot obbtain advertist product will try to make money from illegal activities to satisfied their desire.

In conclusion,advertising has a lot of advantages in economic such as more consumer to purchase their products and provide more opportunities to employement.While it also has negative way in social bacause it will break people’self esteem and increase rate of crime.In my opinion,undoubtedly advertisment can improve economic but need some law to regulate it to prevent social issue.",4
Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many staffs hold the belief that academic qualifications are less essential than social skills in terms of job applications. I would argue that I fully disagree with this motion due to some reasons.

First of all, there are some jobs that require applicants with a relevant academic degree to fulfil the position especially medical doctor, pharmacist, naval engineer, and many other jobs. These professions have a great responsibility and high complexity. For example, doctors have to make a diagnosis of the patients and then make a medical prescription. This job could not tackle by the ones who do not have  special qualifications and formal degrees in medical doctors. The applicants who do not have medical qualifications would give a wrong diagnosis and prescription to the patient.

Secondly, academic qualifications would give adventages to solve the jobs. Academic qualifications come with specific knowledge for example applicants from industrial engineering backgrounds would have some knowledge in financial analysis, market analysis, risk analysis, production process design, factory layout design and many other skills. All of these skills could help the applicants to make a good feasibility study report. Some skills might  learn through discussion with other competent and experienced staff, but it would take a long time and undetailed.

Thirdly, social skill is one of the important skill in  working life, but they could overweight the role of academic qualifications. Some jobs could not be solved through negotiation and discussion. For instance, big data analysis needs special knowledge of software operation and a good understanding of  coding in order to transform big data into useful information.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the aforementioned points, it can be reiterated that I fully disagree that academic qualifications are less than social skill for job applicants.",4
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some believe that humans should accept the climate change problem and should try to live with this situation, on the contrary, others think it would be better if we understand it and take action to prevent its impacts. While I accept finding a way to stay with it, I believe that it would be better if we can prevent it in advance by being aware of our lifestyles in order to provide a quality of life for us and the coming generations.

First and foremost, climate change is the main problem that humans have faced recently for several decades and it does affect our life beings, while a growing number of research has confirmed that human activity is one of the main causes contributing to this change. Regarding the negative effects of this situation, it is essential for us to take action to avoid further devasting effects of climate change such as losing biodiversity and extinction of existed species. There are simple methods that we can apply to cope with this problem instead of neglecting it. For example, most countries nowadays try to promote clean energy by replacing fossil energy and also encourage domestic businesses to maintain their Carbon emission. These measures can help to secure the future for the younger generation to live in this world peacefully. Consequently, preventing climate change by changing our individual activities is a must and turns out to be the most effective way towards this significant situation.

On the other hand, some people tend to believe that humans should learn to live with climate change. This might be because they prefer to accept nature's outcomes as the best solution since it is hard to prevent the natural phenomenon. Thus, we should take risks on climate change and find other ways to survive. As a result, some technology has been invented to help humans in order to support the changing lifestyles. For instance, there are some innovations established to fight against those effects of climate change such as the system warning for tsunamis and earthquakes as well as drought climate detection for crop protection. With a help of advanced technology, we could possibly stabilize our long lives towards the severe weather condition.

Nonetheless, I partially disagree with the view that we should ignore those changes in weather, but instead, we should be aware of our lifestyles since it is one of the main causes driving an increase in temperature around the world. Trying to live with climate change should always be the value that we keep in mind, but it is not because we intend to do nothing to protect our nature, conversely, we as humans, need to awake and try to prevent it as much as we can to ensure a better place for the next generations.

In conclusion, I am convinced that climate change could be prevented by changing our lifestyles and raising awareness among us. However, in my opinion, it is a necessity to live and learn from the failures that we have made to nature in order to sustain this world effectively.",4
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.


What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In many countries, history plays an essential part of the community, and because of this there are a significant number of people who was building interest in searching about the history of their house or building they live in. The certain reason for this is mainly the curiosity about the story behind the structure , and a society can research about this by interviewing with their old generations.

Many individuals are fascinated with their ancestral house and formulation of curiosity on their mind about the materials used, and the story of their home. This may lead to some cultural belief and superstition of several society such as where the door should be, the placement of the ornaments, and even the stairs of the house are important. For instance, my aunt is a believer of superstition, thus she always does special placement of their appliances and sofas in their home.

 Furthermore, researching for this matter is possible through asking the older generations. For example, I obtained the history of our ancestral house with my grandparents, who used to give information about the story why our house where built like this, because of the typhoon that was hit our town. Moreover, an additional information can be taken through the modern technology where a considerable information can be seen and tackled.

In conclusion, several individuals are turned in to history of the house or building they accommodate with because of interested to have an idea about the story, and it can be obtained through word of mouth by the elders.",4
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued by many people that the increasing price of material is the most effective method to address worldwide environmental issues. However, I tend to believe that it is not the most effective way since it may cause other problematic issues for the population of the world.

To begin with, vehicles are considered  one of the major factors leading to environmental problems such as air pollution. As cars exhaust toxic fumes, they present dire threats to the natural world. Nevertheless, people are unwilling to stop driving private cars, even realizing the aftermath of the overconsumption of petrol. Thus, growth in the cost of fuel will not cut down global demand for petrol in order to eradicate environmental problems.

On the other hand,a rise in the price of fuel can lead to a  multitude of difficulties for some countries. First of all, it might have an adverse impact on the economy, which will generate challenging circumstances for population. As the cost of petrol increases, it will cause utility bills to rise, such as electricity, water or gas. Furthermore,a  growth in the cost of living may pose financial hardships to people, which even can result in the rise in the unemployment rate. Lastly, rising fuel costs can have a detrimental effect on the airline industry. It is undeniable that ticket prices and additional fees will rise because of the increase in the cost of airline fuel. As a consequence, the number of passengers who want to travel by air might decrease.

To conclude, increasing the cost of fuel is not the most reasonable way to resolve environmental issues. In my opinion, there are some alternative options to address environmental problems by raising people’s awareness about this global emergency.It is argued by many people that the increasing price of material is the most effective method to address worldwide environmental issues.

"some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is thought by some that a university education is a stepping stone to building up a lucrative  employment status in life, while other groups believe that getting a job directly after school education is the better option . Although tertiary studies can reinforce the future career development of an individual , in my opinion , I affirm that the interested students must be promoted to start working straight away after acquiring their basic education.Let us discuss this in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.

To begin with, let us shed light on the argument that higher education is crucial for a better future. First and foremost, most professionals are highly qualified. In addition, the doctors, engineers or whoever decorating the higher positions in the society are well qualified with graduation and post-graduation certificates  that made them  lead a successful and satisfactory career in their life. For example, in India the staff members of the schools are categorised as principals, teachers, administrators and other lower grade positions are employed based on their academic qualifications which include the level of their degrees that helped them to create a successful pathway.

On the other hand, there are certain points to support the decision of working without university qualifications. Primarily, personal skills are the building blocks of a successful staff member in his organisation. Moreover, leadership qualities, time management, emotional intelligence and collaboration and cooperation among a team are playing a crucial role in the achievements of a staff member. For instance, the success behind the Microsoft company is the patience and leadership qualities of Bill Gates rather than his tertiary qualifications.

In conclusion, the overall development of a successful career is the subtotal of educational certificates and the innate characteristics of an individual. In my point of view, the factors behind a rewarding career are decided by the personal interest of a person whether he or she is affiliated with studies or would like to cultivate their personal  skills.",3

Because it is the field that they grow up in ,and it is believed that the better location to start your historical journey is your home town. In this essay  the reasons why people have a passion for finding out information about their homes and where they can find some resources to extract the knowledge .

Firstly, having large data regarding history will increase the knowledge of the person, it is considered that the more you know ; the more you are valuable in society .

  Furthermore , mankind is trying to hold their culture and  heritage  by knowing more and more about their original background and houses. Consequently , 

They can share their knowledge with other individuals .

Secondly , based on research the best source to extract the ancient information  about your home town  would be the local library of the neighborhood that you live in. due to it is usually the oldest part in the city where you can find most of the data .

On the other hand , as we are living in the age of technology ,people can search on Google where every piece of information is provided. But sometimes it could be inaccurate , therefore the first one is better.

"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The industrial revolution has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for a large section of the world population. But it has not been able to catch up with the ever-increasing population that has more than doubled in the last half a century. In this essay we will discuss specifically how lack of growth aspirations of nations deprives its citizens of means to feed itself and how too much of it  causes environmental impact for the next generation.

To begin with, we should understand that the immediate solution to the hunger problem is by alleviating people from their poverty. This can be done by creating employment opportunities through the introduction of free-market policies by the government which can help incubate new businesses and also existing businesses to thrive. It is clearly a win-win situation all around because it is an organic way to solve a systemic problem.  

On the other hand, traditional means of growing food such as agriculture and horticulture will have to be scaled to meet the growing demand of the population. This will mean acquiring land through deforestation and creating new water systems by building dams. Although this would create employment opportunities for the local people, it will also affect the environment because the flora and fauna will be completely destroyed. The entire ecosystem that depended on them will also vanish over a period of time affecting the future generations and subjecting them to unknown challenges.

Today's generation has to make sure the economy continues to grow such that earning opportunities are available for everyone. But at the same time, it also has to ensure that investments are made in inventing technology that will reduce dependencies on natural resources which cannot be replenished as fast as we consume them.",3
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old.

Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","There is a strong believe that the government ought to look after and support people while they retired. However, not everybody share the same point of view and they assume that every single person is responsible for own future. In my opinion, both groups have right, nevertheless, the authority should support own citizens especially after they hardly earned the future pension.

Firstly, every single country has set the length of work time, which can give a right to get the minimal pension. Average person works much longer than that, to get higher amount of money, which will let them afford level of life they used to it. Moreover, it would be unfair when the government could not pay back or support them when they get old. It is their responsibility to save some part of money to be able offer them to the older population. 

On the other hand, the opponents claims that every individual need to save own money on a separate bank account for future. In addition, they do not have any trust in the further authority plans and advise to have a backup plan. I will probably listen to them because we do not know what may happen in the next decade. Surprisingly, saving just 10% of our monthly wage can give a boost of money available on our retirement. 

To sum up, I believe we should have trust in the country where we live and politics, however, can not boycott people who are afraid of their future. The current situation is extremely unstable and noone is able to predict and ensure the public about something what will be ready for them, for instance, in 40 years period of time.",3
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger. What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?,"Growing population has become one of the significant issues globally as it can have both positive and negative consequences. In the recent trends, it is observed that in certain countries there is a hike in the count of children who are less than 16 year old. In this essay, I will analyze the feasible effects this growth can bring to the nation at present and future in terms of merits as well as demerits.

To begin with, the pattern observed has its own results in the present. On the positive side, as the number progresses to be high the government is enforced to provide better sanitation facilities for the kids, since the kids are more vulnerable to diseases. This will not only benefit the younger ones but also the adults by providing them with good medical facilities. However, looking at the other side, the public bodies will have to spend more on the resources such as food and education. This can cause a considerable amount of stress for them in terms of financial aspect, which can eventually lead to an increase in the tax collection that affects the public.

Moving further ahead and thinking about the consequences of the future, there will be a good revampment in terms of the nation's infrastructure development in numerous fields including internet, business and health. This is due to the fact that there will be a plethora of educated people with a specialization in a variety of fields. Contradictorily, the more number of educated youths can lead to an adverse situation namely unemployment. As the count of the competent persons in a domain is more, the most skillful ones will end up with a job. So the government needs to plan accordingly to provide employment to all the citizens.

To recapitulate, this essay deals with the various factors that can impact the nations where there is a constant improvement in the population.",3

In recent times, every one on plant has faced consequences of nature such as climate change, most of the harm that's done to nature is caused by humans and as a result animals that depend on nature are facing problems. This topic has became highly debateable topic. In the following eassy I shall discuss my views and opinion and thus conclude with a possiable solution.

On the other hand, some people say that it's not too late to take precautions and to control the damage by only swithching in to solar energy, which reduces the green house gas effects. Furthurmore, every one should be taught about recycling the waste rather than dumping in to rubbish which specillay includes plastic, which would effect the sea life. For instance, a documentary by National Georgraphic channel telecasted a program about the sea life, which shows that mammels  consider that thrash as food and eat them and die, due to digestion and the wastage becomes a topic, to eleborate there is a movie named Wall-e which has a message that earth would be evcuated because it's no longer suitable for human survival and all trees and animals become extent. In order to avoid this situation every one should be taught about the environment and how to protect it.

People should be educated to reduce the waste and also plant more plants, and also learn to protect the animal species. More over, in some countries have already taken a stand forward in doing public awarness, for example INDIA's prime minister has offically declared that any suburb that plants more trees, would be eligable for good tax benfits.

To conclude, people may vary in their opinion. I strongly believe that what happened is past, now every one should learn improtance of nature and animals species, this could be only done with the help of news and social awarness camps.",3
Children find it difficult to pay attention or concentrate on school study what are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, children face difficulties concentrating in school classes and their studies. There are a number of reasons why they don’t focus on studying. That, I will explain and give a solution to the problem.

There are many causes why pupils don’t pay attention to school studies. The first reason is the syllabus of the semester. To illustrate, mostly secondary or high secondary academy have more than five subjects which students find hard to memorise . The second reason is the way teachers teach them. Many offspring cannot understand what tutors teach them and find their way of teaching boring. Lastly, there are fewer enjoyable activities in academy. For example, most faculty don’t have subjects like art and drawing. That is why children cannot focus on study.

To solve this problem parents and institutes need to come forward and take some steps. For instance, department need to arrange a parent meeting every month and parents also pay close attention to their children. Moreover, university can add some new subjects such as arts and crafts so children can relax in class. For example, if department add art classes so students enjoy them and it also refreshes their minds. These are the solutions to the issue.

In conclusion, because of the subject load and less mind fresh activities children cannot focus on their classes and studies. To solve it parents and institutes need to pay close attention to pupils and they also need to include some enjoyable activities such as arts and drawing in their syllabus.",3
Some people think that public health of a country can be improved if the government make laws regarding nutritious food but others think that it is the matter of personal choice and personal responsibility.Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, most of people always concern about health which is the most important aspect of our life.Some people believe that having a laws in nutritious food by the government is the best ways for keeping public health.However, others think that it is the duty of our personal responsibility and option.This essay will provide both sides of this statement.

             Begin with, the reason why government should create laws about nurtritious food is people will have food that benefit for themselves.This can increase the number of good health in our society.Moreover, it can reduce the amount of obesity that come from unhealthy food such as sugar.For example, in japan have a restriction that coke should be in term of low sugar that cause people do not have a chance for drinking full sugar.Then their citizen have a healthy body.

            On the other hand, people should have an oppotunity of chosing their food.This is because people have a different life styles and we do not know that what they dislike or enjoy on that food.Therefore it is the ability for citizen to opt their nutritious food. For instance, I always eat a healthy food that I intersted on because I noticed that this is my soul and I should keep it fit.

               In conclusion, government laws and personal responsibility have an advantage in the different ways.Government can help for stricking about types for foods.While personal responsiblity provide people to select their own food.",3
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people hold the view that adolescents should go to community work in their free time without salary, because this can help both young people and the community. In my point of view, I totally agree with this opinion.

           First, do the community work in your free time helps teenagers a lot. When participating in community activities such as volunteering, helping disadvantaged people, they will experience more and learn valuable life skills. A teenager who joins in a lots of unpaid community work will have more life skills than the one who does not do anything. Because through the work, he can learn many new things from people. Not only that, through his work experience, he will also have valuable materials for future employment.

         On the other hand, when young people do unpaid community work our country's quality of life will improve. If society is contributed by the effort of youth, our life will develop day by day. Because,when working, teenagers will have more love for the country and society and from there they will always try to dedicate for the growing country. The society where teenagers who are always be ready to contribute will develop more than the one where teenagers are usually lazy to work. The USA is a very developed country with the largest civilization in the world, and American teenagers are always ready to participate in a lot of community activities.

             In conclusion, it not only good for teenagers to join in unpaid community activities, but also bring many benefits for the society. So, i hope teenagers in our country will be ready for doing community work in their free time.",3
"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In today's ,world social skills are given utmost importance over the educational background and many of the recruiters try to employ candidates with such qualities.  I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.

In contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.

In conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.",8
Some people think news has no connection to the people lives. So it is a waste of time to read the news in newspaper and watch television news program. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Although some individuals state that reading or watching the news is unworthy as this has no such relevancy with regular life, I completely disagree with this statement because I think the news has absolute cconnection with living and significant to enrich the knowledge.

News is based on the current happenings of citizens' lives. In the features of newspaper or media broadcastings, viewers actually see the daily utmost occurrences, great initiatives, or other attractive work, which are important and can allure the followers. Publishers get such topics and plots from the daily instances of humans, such as accident, innovation or significant political decisions. Thus, the press releases and media announcements are closely related to individuals. For instance, recently a brutal rape case is got viral via online which is not only a tale of the victim but also many of the woman of this world.

News enriches the individuals' level of the horizon. If an individual is read the paper, magazines, or watch reporting focused channels regularly that person is likely to inculcate most information from them. Consequently, more data and experience will be stored in his memory and with the progress of time he will be more resourceful; this gathered knowledge will promote him to grasp opportunities. For example, a survey conducted by Wikipedia revealed that the percentage of being successful in the job interview is higher among those candidates who are regular observers of the published article.

In conclusion, some people opine that bulletins are no such relation with daily life; yet, following these would create no such value. Nevertheless, I believe, watching and listening  bulletins are highly required to enrich knowledge as grasp scopes.",8
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantage of technology outweigh the disadvantages,"It is believed by some experts that social media is a good source of entertainment and also helps us to make incredible contacts with each other. I agree with this aforementioned notion because it helps us to know about the world and it makes our work easier as compared to the past. Although, it has some demerits too.

On the one hand side, technical gadgets play an indispensable role in the modern era. Furthermore, nowadays, it makes our work and lifestyle easier. For example, by social media, people can get information in every nook and corner of the world without wastage of time

like nowadays, pupils can chat with each other by using many social apps like  WhatsApp for chatting, tweeter for spreading out the news, and so on. In the past, people did not have this type of water to talk and they were not aware of how to use it. Additionally, in today's world, people become more realistic and have a piece of great knowledge about gadgets so, it is becoming their jobs easier and fast. All in all, we can say the merits are more of this outweigh the demerits.

On the other hand, it has some drawbacks also because sometimes it can create difficulties. Moreover, by using popular social apps, people can create violence. For instance, youngsters use more and more chatting apps, and many times they spread out the fake news in all their knowns and it spread so fast in less time and can halt the society. Furthermore, nowadays, a large number of youngsters are using social news and they love to post their data on social apps and open their identity for refused ones.

In conclusion, I reckon that social television has put a wonderful influence on community lifestyles because it is well-known and can save individuals time. Although, it can be harmful sometimes because it gives a big hand to spread out the fake news on the earth",8
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In the contemporary era, thanks to numerous technological advancements, many academic establishments have been offering digital courses as an alternative to conventional classes at school. From my perspective, this is primarily a positive phenomenon despite some drawbacks.

On the one hand, what should be carefully considered is the efficiency of digital courses. If students enrol in online lectures at open places such as coffee shops, they will be easily distracted by extrinsic factors. Hence, they might not fully comprehend these lectures. Moreover, some soft skills, such as communication skills or teamwork, might be best trained and practised in person. Therefore, when they do not attend physical classes, such skills do not seem to be effectively enhanced. Eventually, virtual courses might be potentially detrimental to learning efficiency.

On the other hand, online courses are beneficial for both learners and universities. First and foremost, students can effortlessly access reading references and online lectures with electronic devices connected to the Internet. Hence, they can actively schedule their timetable and learn wherever they wish; for instance, some might want to study at a coworking space which can foster their creativity. Additionally, universities could also optimize their operation cost by curtailing the budgets used for basic commodities served on campus. Expenditures on electricity or water could be taken as prime examples. Ultimately, digital studying programs are likely to facilitate enrollment in higher education among students and optimize budgets for education systems.

In conclusion, virtual study is an inevitable trend in today’s world, especially with the boom of advanced technologies. Regardless of some minus points, I do advocate that it can be deemed largely positive regarding how it encourages studying attendance and allows universities to implant optimization schemes.",8
"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","History always plays a vital role in the journey of mankind.In the modern world, people were more curious to know about the past incidents that happened in the houses they live in. Different people use  different methodologies to identify the past and they have their own reasons to do so. In this essay ,I will discuss  the motive for this and how they dig out the past.

To begin with,people were always eager to know about  ancient events just to ensure that nothing unnatural happened in the place they want to live. Some investigations are done to make sure that it is safe to live in the house. For instance, the public will enquire about the apartment to the neighbourhood and the surroundings like whether any unnatural death or any mystery exists for the property they are going to buy ,due to some superstitious beliefs. However,Some families enquire about the history of the neighbourhood and surroundings to start a friendship with them and the owner can be comfortable while they move in.

Furthermore, society adapts  numerous ways to do this investigation part.Some families will ask directly to the fellow beings in that area,while others prefer to do it themselves by searching the places around them and garage areas. At the same time , the majority fulfil this task by having a deep conversation with the previous owner. A personal example to be cited here is that when my uncle decided to buy a building near the city he had a discussion with the previous owner regarding why he is moving out and how he feels when he lives in that home. So it will help us to have a better understanding of the apartments.

To conclude,apartment history is always important for the person who is going to buy it because for various reasons and for that the person will use various ideas to know more about the buildings such as enquire to the surrounding and through a detailed discussion with the previous owner.",8
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements?
What measures can be taken to protect them?","It is hard to deny that advertising from competing companies can impair consumers' consumption concepts as advertisements always trying to persuade people to purchase expensive but maybe unsuitable products. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that advertising is harmful to consumers, and  should be censored or even controlled by the government. However, such a statement suffers from logical and factual fallacies and should be examined meticulously. As far as the economy, employment, and consumption concept are concerned, I firmly hold that advertisements can be beneficial to society and the community, and false or harmful information should be censored by the government.

First and foremost, the advertising industry provides employment, as it has become a creative industry that gives profitable jobs to many people. To be more specific, advertising has become a modern art and many universities or colleges have this subject, providing many graduates for companies or celebrities to advertise and increase their influence. In addition, there are many job vacancies as almost all companies need to advertise their products to consumers.

Furthermore, the fact that advertising can boost sales of one company or product, improving the  economy indicates that it can be beneficial. For example, take the case of YeShu, a well-known milk company famous for its quality and good taste: huge investment in advertising makes people associate its brand image with high quality, good taste, and even making people smart. As a result, more and more consumers know and buy its products. Had it not been for its impressive and attractive advertisement, YeShu would need have become one of the largest companies in the drinking industry.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that advertising is always trying to manipulate people to consume more and has influenced many people even children to develop a bad consumption concept. Ironically, though advertising is trying to persuade consumers to buy more, people can not be easily manipulated. For instance, consumers can see comments and reviews from other consumers, and advertisements that boost too much can easily find out.

In a nutshell, I maintain that foreign visitors should pay more as such a policy is feasible to implement, and benefits our national culture and economy. Admittedly, as my favourite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues to fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me. However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article",8
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no dought that people stay employed due to many factors, and money has been considered the most essential reason to remain in the same job. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement and I am going to elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.

First and foremost, job satisfaction is considered to be a major contributor to office's enthusiasm, due to the fact that doing what you love makes your activities or test easier and more interesting. In other words, it gives you the feeling of pleasure, which can help you get rid of stress got in the workplace. Take my mother as an example, she is an elementary school teacher and has been teaching English for over 30 years. Although she only earned a little money, she took delight in it. Because she really likes to teach children and was also highly respected by her students. As a consequence, satisfaction plays a significant role in putting more effort into performance.

Furthermore, the atmosphere at work is also one of the crucial causes to be in the workplace. Working with friendly colleagues and a well boss can boost employees' confidence and happiness  because it creates a comfortable working environment without coworker pressure. For example, despite my workplace being extremely far from my home, my colleagues are so kind that I decided to stay and work with them. Therefore, people ignore unpleasant factors when they are working in a great team.

In conclusion, cash motivates a part of society to work. However, satisfaction and the working environment also have an important impact.",8
"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion","There is a controversial idea heating a debate over the fact that the major perk of international cooperation is in the environmental protection or is in the business worldwide. From my point of view, the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend for the following reasons.

On the one hand, it cannot be deniable that the environment plays an indispensable role in our daily lives. For the most part, given all nations are inexorably connected financially and politically, wealthier countries may provide poorer countries with ecologically linked aid in order to slow down their unrestrained industrialization. Whatever the outcomes of these activities, collective global efforts have a significant influence on individual consciousness, prompting people to act ecologically responsibly. Furthermore, by exchanging creative ideas, international collaboration might enable scientists to start research seminars. These measures, for instance, will create additional clean energy such as wind and solar in order to address significant environmental issues.

On the other hand, globalization also improves world business to a large extent in terms of the economy. For one, international collaboration will allow various countries to leverage their own advantages in order to maximize their economic growth potential. Taking China as an example, the country's large population draws more labour-intensive businesses such as manufacturing, resulting in more employment possibilities. Additionally, enhanced international trade operations can provide individuals with greater access to high-quality foreign items, thus improving their living standards and sense of satisfaction. On account of that, the growing international collaboration will eventually help the global economy.

To sum up, I believe that whereas international collaboration may result in certain environmental efforts, it is the corporate sector that gains the most from the progress.",8
"Some people believe that the main benefit of international cooperation is the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world of business. Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have different views as to whether the environment or the world’s economy and businesses benefit most from global cooperation. Personally, I contend that the latter is more likely to enjoy fruitful results from this trend.

One the one hand, when the world becomes a global village, environmental protection turns out to be a common concern and is addressed on a global scale. Kyoto Protocol, which is an international treaty that imposes limitations on CO2 emissions on member nations, helps to reduce a significant amount of the gas into the atmosphere. Were this treaty not brought to life by concerted efforts of many nations, our carbon footprint would be much greater and the damage we did to our planet would be more severe. Moreover, given countries are inexorably linked to each other economically and politically, the wealthier ones could introduce environmentally linked aid to poorer countries with a view to curb their uncontrolled paces of industrialization. Whatever the results of these practices, at least collective attempts made worldwide brings a great impact on individual consciousness, which prompts individuals to act environmentally responsibly.

However, I believe that economic prosperity is the main by-product of global integration. Thanks to an increasingly free global market, a number of undeveloped nations are being lifted out of poverty through either exporting their strengths or foreign investments. This is not likely to happen in times of political isolation had been the norm since the flows of goods, money, and humans were limited within national boundaries or regional borders. Furthermore, global cooperation enables transnational or international corporations to locate their manufacturing facilities on the other side of the world where cheap and abundant labours could make a huge difference in price production, leaving them an edge over their rivals.

In conclusion, I think, even though international cooperation could bring about some initiatives regarding environmental preservation it is the world of business that benefits most from the development.",8
"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it is perceived that the effective way to remedy issues relating to the environment is to increase the pump price of gas for vehicles generally. Although some people believe that this move would resolve the environmental crisis, however, I vehemently disagree with that statement. This essay will elaborate that petroleum products such as fuel is not the major cause of climate disasters and increasing the cost price will not yield their intended purpose.

To start with, research has shown that harvesting  trees without replacing them, mining and poor waste management  are the major causes of environmental problems. Besides, if we fail to address  

the aforementioned  causes and concentrate on fuel alone, I am afraid that the situation will be worse in the future. For instance, the government should legislate a law that prohibits the cutting of trees, wrongful disposal of waste and regulate mining companies. Despite the fact that increasing the prices of gas would to some extent aid in protecting the environment, nonetheless, it will not have tremendous a benefit as one may think. 

Moreover, even though an uptrend in the prices of gas to some extent will curb about 10% of environmental problems, that in itself is not sufficient, as it will cause hardship on the people as most of them will resort to other activities such as coal mining which will be detrimental to the environment. To exemplify, in 2021, the authorities in Sierra Leone  increased the cost of fuel from 10,000 Leones to 20,000 Leones per litre in order to discourage vehicle owners from using their cars. Sadly, the transport fare for public transport shot up and the prices of groceries and other goods became a big challenge for its citizens. In addition, curbing fuel in isolation will not be beneficial to the climate. 

In conclusion,  even though some people believe that increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles in my estimation, I totally disagree with that position.",8
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, factors such as human activities, geomagnetic fluctuation lead to global warming and other disaster weathers, the advocation of finding a way to live with these climate change other than preventing them have become controversial. realistically, I disagree with this opinion, prevention should be considered as the priority. 

To begin with, climate changes could produce negative influences on the world. Disastrous weather such as hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, In 2004, the Tsunami in Indonesia took away millions of lives, thousands of families have lost their members and homes, and it caused a long-lasting severe economic loss not only in East Asia but also to the world.  Although the affected area has received emergency aids from domestic and international societies, the reconstruction works are still enormous and it may take decades to recover. Other examples such as melting ice sheets in the north pole which is caused by global warming,  would lead to the rise in ocean level and there is really not much that humans could do to change it. Furthermore, Coastal areas would be flooded and many species would lose theirs inhabits.  In order to tackle this problem  which is technically impossible to be solved and governments would have to spend an unimaginable amount of money 

The fact has proven it is hard to survive and live with the consequence when climate change comes; therefore, every possible action must be taken to protect our environment and to prevent any disasters from happening. On the one hand, individuals would make a contribution by using reusable bags and going to work by walking or public transportation to reduce contamination to the environment.  On the other hand, governments and international organizations should promote eco-friendly resources in civilian use to help reduce emissions of fossil fuel. As a consequence, the world would develop in a more sustainable way and save more money in dealing with adapting to climate changes. 

To sum up, I think prevention is always better than cure. we all should take actions to help to reduce pollutions.",8
Some people think technology makes life complex so we should make our life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent days, a topic has aroused heated debate in society about whether modern technology has made life more complicated. Some people think that if we don't use technology, our life might be easier and simpler. In my opinion, this is a complete pipe dream.

Technology is certainly not the real reason for complicating human life, but it is the most effective way to make it less complicated. For those who view technological improvement in a misunderstood way, the emergence of various high-tech products has made our lives unnecessarily complicated, and we have to spend time learning new technologies. Our brains make it impossible for us to do things easily, but we are confused by appearances and blame it all on the development of technology. Human civilization forces our lives to be complicated. No matter how technologically developed we are, we have to deal with overpopulation, resource shortages, or environmental pressures and figure out ways to solve them.

On the other hand, we are now so used to relying on modern technology that I can't imagine how we and our descendants would struggle in a world without modern transportation, tall buildings, or communication apps. Despite their flaws, they are the most suitable solutions ever conceived of for all the current problems that human beings face while going through an increasing population society.

In conclusion, it is humanity and global development that compel our lives to become more complex, while technology suffers the fate of simplifying them. Therefore, reducing our reliance on technology in order to achieve an unrealistically simple life is unreasonable.",6
Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"In recent times, the development in the field of robotics has increased rapidly and its prevalence can be noticed in many places. Many believe robots are crucial for human development whereas some argue they have a negative effect on society. This essay would discuss both  views with empirical evidence and conclude with my opinion.

To begin with, artificial intelligence is one of the greatest milestones achieved by humans. They can be used to study places which are inaccessible to humans. For instance, the world-renowned rover Curiosity, was sent to Mars for a detailed analysis of the planet's features. Without robotic technology, it would take another decade to achieve this feat. Hence, this technology plays a vital role in the development of mankind.

On the other hand, robotic machines have replaced men in many jobs. For instance, in many food and packaging industries, programmed machines are used as they are more efficient and fast when compared to a worker. Furthermore, a robot can work for long hours without any breaks, thus increasing in productivity of a company. This scenario can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate causing a detrimental effect on  society.

To sum it up, robots have a pivotal role in  future development and the need for them is inevitable. Although this development has a downside, considering the future technological advancement, robotic science and technology are essential to achieve it.",6
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","In contemporary society, some schools removed abilities such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork because they believe that these subjects should not be learned at school as it is better to learn these from family and peers. Therefore, some think that schools should pay attention to studying academics so that students can succeed and pass examinations. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this proposition believe that it is beneficial for students if institutions focus on curriculums. There is no denying that academic knowledge is important to children to apply for jobs in the future. For example, some positions in a company such as manager, analyst, and executive have to use academic knowledge rather than professional skills. Moreover, when kids learn about physical abilities like woodwork in their free time with their friends or family, they can develop relationships through  cooperation. As a result, institutions remove vocational subjects in order to give more time to learn for students.

On the other hand, those who argue this idea think that schools should not decrease the time the educating vocational curricula. It is obvious that when students exceed focus on academic study, they can get a street which makes it impossible to carry. For instance, when some students do not pass the exam, they may get depressed. Furthermore, some companies need people who have  professional abilities.

In conclusion, schools should not teach capacities like dressmaking but should encourage students to be educated in academic subjects so as to succeed. In my view, I strongly agree with this issue because academic subjects are too easy to find work.",6
"Some people think the news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A lot of millennials are of the notion that daily updates from the world do not play a vital role in the life of an individual. It is merely time wastage to read newspapers and watch the news on the television. I partially agree with the aforementioned statement and will discuss both sides of the topic.

Analysing the statement, many people believe that, nowadays, watching updates related to the personal lives of famous people which usually includes sportsmen, actors, actresses, business tycoons and politicians is futile. They feel observing this newsnews not only waste their time but also leaves a negative impact on the lives of an individual, especially youth and teenagers. It is believed youth easily get influenced by their choices, behaviour and fashion trends which usually have a negative effect on them.

Explaining further, another school of thought belong to the masses who support the idea of telecasting and publishing the news. Due to ,globalisation it has become important to keep ourselves updated with the happenings of the world. Moreover, it also enriches our knowledge and enhances our vocabulary. To add to this, global news keeps us informed about the latest discoveries and innovations.

To recapitulate, in my view, news broadcasting is really helpful and knowledgeable as it keeps us up-to-date with emerging technologies and events happening across the globe; however, sometimes the news related to the personal lives of famous personalities is completely useless and a waste of time. Therefore, individuals should decide on which side they ought to invest their valuable time.",6
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowadays, some people think that art is not a necessary field for students however others thinks it very essential to have it. In this ,essay we will discuss both the sides of having  art subject for children and also my opinion.

Art is a prosperous way to describe our feelings. A report says that 80 per cent of people when drawing some piece of art, so they are trying to show their inner feeling whether it be happiness or sorrow. For example,  A friend of mine was interested in drawing paintings and I used to ask him the reason to draw painting. Therefore, one  day he told me that he try to narrate his inner pain by drawing and painting.

However, this is also true that with the advent of technology people have started focusing more on the development of new technologies. Parents find subjects like arts useless because they know that technology is flourishing and so they also know that their kids can have a good future if they focused more on technology rather than the arts. To illustrate, when I was doing my bachelor of technology the total number of seats available was only 120 in every field. So, in information technology and computer science there was not a single seat of admission left whereas the other branch was approx half vacant. Parents usually say if they studied art subject they will not be able to concentrate on technological subjects.

In my opinion, I think it is very much necessary to have art subject as it makes child body and mind relax. To conclude I would say students feel energetic by doing painting while after looking at today scenario it is also necessary to have these subject classes once  a week as gaining knowledge in the technology field is foremost.",6
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?
Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 
You should write at least 250 words.","Nowadays the percentage of people, which want to have a child in their middle age is rising. This essay will discuss the reasons why it occurs and will provide arguments for its advantages and disadvantages.
In my opinion the rise in the rate of people, who decided to have children in their later age than in the past is due to reason: desire to build stronger financial bases for future family. More young people realize that to carry about children and provide them with all necessary needs are not cheap and all this thing requires a sustainable financial source. That is why a lot of people try firstly to build a successful career, which results in forming a strong financial basement and only after that to plan a child. For example, a lot of Russian survey's results demonstrate that the lack of enough money is the main reason of delaying of planning children. 
There are advantages and disadvantages of this statement. From one point of view, it is better to have a child in more wealthy conditions because all our and child's demand would be satisfied. For instance, to take care of children and provide them with a quality access to all necessary services, which impact on their development, require a lot of financial investments. 
On the other hand it is bad to have children in later age because of physical opportunities  for mothers. Childbirth is a strong stress on women's health and according to evolution from year to year women's body does not become younger and stronger for bringing a birth of a baby. For instance, there are many cases when children of middle aged women were born with some physical disabilities. 
In my personal opinion, advantages of late planning kid outweigh disadvantages due to modern human demands. Moreover, medicine's achievements allow women to solve their physical problems. 
Summarizing the ideas mentioned above it has become clear that there are advantages and disadvantages of late planning children  and the main reason of this is desired to make a confident financial base.",6
"Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women.
What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation?","Men have dominated job sector since the industrial revolution, despite progress in gender equality. Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in the tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. 

Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their marital and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a college degree or a computer science graduation tends to lower their confidence at work place or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instance, in Asian countries people believe that men are the bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education, but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.

Many women activists across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As a result of this, today, many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their workforce have equal number of women and men employed. Other than this IT sector need to diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.

To conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams.",6
"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Interviews are commonly used as a way to screen candidates at large companies. However, some people argue that interviews are not an effective way to recruit employees. I agree that relying on interviews alone can sometimes lead to hiring the wrong candidate. However, I believe that when used in combination with other assessment methods, such as group activities and quizzes, interviews can be a valuable tool in the hiring process.

 

Organisations are increasingly using group activities to assess candidates' suitability for their roles. This allows them to see how potential employees react under pressure and how they handle conflict. These simulations give organisations a better understanding of candidates' values, behaviours and thinking patterns. As candidates often lie in the interview and tend to act like robots answering the questions the way the recruiter expects, the information gathered in the group work can then be used alongside interview results to make final hiring decisions.

 

Personality quizzes can be another useful tool for assessing job seekers' profiles and determining their strengths and weaknesses. Such tests can help to identify which candidates are naturally good mediators and which ones will require more direction from others. If one of the criteria for the role is to hire someone with strong leadership skills, then mediators may be the best option. 

 

Interviews are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to recruiting. While they can provide valuable insights into a candidate's qualifications, it's important to use other methods as well. This will help the company to validate the information provided by the candidate and make a more informed decision.  In the end, it's important to remember that no single method is perfect. Using a variety of methods will help to give you the best chance of finding the right candidate for the job.",6
"Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",6
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Nowadays, many people who live in their house or condominium are interested in searching for the information in the past of their house or condominium. In the following paragraphs, the reasons and sources of information will be discussed in detail.

       To begin with, people want to know about the information which what happened in the past for learning about the history of their house or apartment. Moreover, they will know about the meaning of architecture that there was built by what styles such as minimal style, luxury style or vintage style.

       In addition, people who are interested in the history of their houses or buildings have many ways to search for  information. Firstly, they can research from the library since there are many books to find out the information that they want to know about the history of their house or apartment. Secondly, If they don't want to go to the library, they will search the internet for information about the history of their houses or buildings. Finally, they can  interview  neighbourhood who live in surrounding their house or building since this source of information are reliable information.

       In conclusion, people who are interested in the history of their house or building have many reasons for finding out the information because they to know what happened in the past, learn about  the history of their accommodation and khow about the style of houses or building. Furthermore, they can research information in a different ways such as finding from the library, searching the internet and interviewing the neighbourhood.",6
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Some countries prefer to single gender school for the education of their pupils. A native of some countries, prefer to send their children to the integrated institutions for their elementary education, because they believe it can affect drastically to their life in the upcoming period. I firmly believe that co-educational institutions are a boon, not only for the healthy future of children, but also for the nation as well.
Firstly, pupils who studied in single sex schools, take huge time to get involved in conversation with the opposite gender, the reason behind is, they never experienced public conversation earlier, therefore, pupils do not feel comfortable to speak publicly and get nervous when they have to ask any question or any favor. Moreover, children who get more comfortable in their own group, sometimes behave in improper way with others as few conversations should remain with close people. Most importantly the context of delivery of words should be accurate and proper; otherwise it could hurt the emotions of others or could leave the person embarrassed. The way of using proper words and gesture could develop by studding together.
Furthermore, students can learn and observe various things from their peer which are having opposite gender by doing healthy competition. This would lead to developing many traits which will enhance their knowledge and experience in a positive way. They will learn the sensitivity of words and acts that is lucrative for their own healthy future. In short, students who studied in co-educational schools are more disciplined and punctual.
In conclusion, students can have many skilled traits by studding together along with students of different age, religion and gender, which is possible by getting enrolled in integrated schools. That will develop the whole nation with the same environment, otherwise single sex school give a different atmosphere to students on the basis of their gender or sex.",6
"some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Nowadays, the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation. Some individuals believe that the price of fuel should be increased to tackle this problem. Although I agree with this opinion, I think that the increasing rate of fuel cost would also have negative effects on society.

On the one hand, raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial. According to this, many people would avoid driving their own cars since they will not be able to afford the high cost of fuel. Besides, they will be motivated to take more public transportation instead of their private cars, resulting in decreasing the heavy traffics. Therefore, the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems. For instance, many people have died annually as a result of lung cancer and respiratory diseases that are caused by air pollution.

on the other hand, increasing the fuel cost would have many drawbacks. Firstly, the public transportation cost will be escalated due to the expensive fuel. Secondly, the transportation expenses for businesses would also be raised. In such cases, companies will be forced to increase the prices of their products to compensate for these high expenses. Thus, people would be burdened with higher living costs. If the government can control these increasing rates of transportation and goods, the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged.

In conclusion, while increasing the fuel cost could place many people under the pressure of difficult economic situations, I agree that it is vital for solving environmental problems.",6
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Space explorations have been developed since  the post- modern era and it has made a huge transformationin  the various sectors of the life; however, there remain some disagreements as to whether this  crucial for the country or the funds can be channelized to more pressing issues. I, personally, consider that it is extremely significant for countries to invest in outer space studies to progress further.
 First of all, it is an indisputable fact that, many  communication facilities and treatment modalities are originally developed for the space research.  CT scan, for instance, which was used to analysis the picture of  the moon and then, scientist realiased that it can be used in the medical field to study the internal organs. Apart from this, communication sector is the another area which is also benefited tremendously by these researches. By lounching satellites to the space, this had revelutionised the way humen communicate and the information technology. Currently, people can have conversations( face to face and voice) with either relatives or friends on the other side of the world by using mobiles or with the internet.
 However, there some people argue that, the amount which has spent can be invested to improve the public infrastructure: hospitals, educational institutions, and transportation facilities. These are the basic requirements need to be provided to the citizens of any country, instead of funding to the  exploration of space. Developing countries, India and China, where a large proportion people lives under poverty, despite this fact, they  allocate a  major portion of income to these research. By contrast, if these nations helped needy people with sufficient amount, they would contribute back to the country.
By way of conclusion, even though people are differed regarding spending money to conduct space research, I , again reaffirm that it is better, if they could use this for nation building and providing minimum facilitities to the society.",5
"Some people think  that in the modern world we are  more dependent on each other, while others believe we have become more independent.

discuss both views and give your opinion","Some people said that the more the world moves towards modernity, the more people become dependent on each other. However, some people believe that with the modernization of the world, the level of dependence of people on each other will decrease. I agree with the second opinion. In the following paragraphs, I will express my opinion while stating the reasons.

    On the one hand, it can be said that with the modernization of the world, people become more dependent on each other, in the sense that today many people can easily communicate with each other, and as a result of that dependence is created. With the advancement of technology and the creation of more modern communication tools, as we can see, people can easily communicate with each other. Take today's mobile phones as an example. A person in a foreign country can easily communicate with someone in a fraction of a second; on the other side of the borders, it is easy to communicate with the Internet connection, and as a result, many long-distance relationships are created in which there is naturally dependence. Although I feel that this type of dependence is unrealistic and there is no correct definition of dependence in this concept.

    On the other hand, it can be said that people are more independent than before. Today, with life conditions becoming more complicated, many people spend many hours of their time working, studying, or studying, and as a result, they are less able to spend time with their friends or family. For example, consider a family where both huslabel and wife are forced to work due to high living expenses such as providing housing, food and clothing, and as a result, they can devote less time to being together, and as a result, they become less dependent on each other. In addition, nowadays the concept of independence is very important and many psychologists emphasize independence especially for women and people care more about this aspect of their personality than before. They become completely independent, they especially tend to be financially independent. In fact, in the past, we saw many people around 30 years old or older who still lived with their families and were financially dependent, but today many people in Younger ages are trying to be independent and I believe this trend will continue and we will see more independent people every day.

    In general, I believe that although modernization with the increase in the level of technology can in some ways make people more dependent than before, but due to reasons such as the complexity of life and the popularization of the concept of independence from a young age, today we see an increase in independent people.",5
"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that in several nations Ladies and Gentlemen should help each other in domestic duties owned to the fact that both are fully employed. Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.
There are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.
Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their huslabels. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.
In conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations. Therefore, I strongly agree with the stand that both can do the dishes without any hesitation. Furthermore, they should make a week blueprint to the best duties management.",5
"Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.
In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.",5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is a fact that some celebrities become more popular for their luxurious lifestyles and possessions these days rather than for their mesmerising accomplishments. To a certain extent, this kind of popularity tends to lead young people in the wrong direction. However, there are also some celebrities who got to the place that they are at the moment for their actions and accomplishments.

On the one hand, some celebrities pursued easy ways to get famous such as getting married to a popular or rich person, living a fancy, shopaholic lifestyle or even doing unbelievable things and streaming live sessions. Moreover, it has become easier as social media platforms such as TikTok and instagram turned into a spotlight especially for those kinds of people. For  instance, the Kardasian family members are now billionaires with all the money gained from their reality show and hot topics of Hollywood despite the fact that not even one of them has a talent such as acting, singing or doing sports. Additionally, a group of TikTokers named Hype House is such a hit and on the tip of the tongue of every teenager these days but what they are doing are inappropriate performances, dances, partying and even breaking rules and restrictions during the pandemic. Such kinds of influences only aim to gain publicity and send a wrong message to the youngsters that successful life means wealth and accessories and it does not have to be meaningful.

On the contrary, it is great to have such kinds of famous people who live with compassion and put their great efforts to gain success in life. From their perspective, a way to success is a combination of passion, hard work and strong determination. Those are the people who apply themselves in developing their skills and abilities through perseverance. As an example, a korean boy label named BTS is nowadays among the most famous celebrities in this 21st century. They came all the way from South Korea and broke amazing records one by one in a way that no South Koreans have ever done before. All the members came from rural areas of their country to Seoul and worked so hard even before their debut. As a result, now they’ve become a tourism ambassador of their country and worked with the United Nations to help improve the mental health of youths under the program called “Love yourself”. Due to their hard work, now, they’ve set a great example and become idols to young people all over the world and made those youngsters believe in themselves and their worth.

In conclusion, it is true that as various types of social media platforms are being accessible these days, children are likely to be influenced by the so-called celebrities. Anyway, there are still some famous people who can make young people believe that their dreams could come true with hard work and passion. Thus, in my opinion, I think it is best if young people become more selective with choosing their role models.",5
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"There is no denying fact that, in recent time some individuals prefers having offsprings at children at older age. In my opinion, it is a positive  development because couple solidify their relationship before the arrival of their kids also they Will cease the opportunity to improve their income. Rasing children late might be stressful because they are out of job.

On one hand, some people believe that arrival of youngsters might distance them from their lover, so they build bond before children started coming. In addition, some couple claimed that wealth should be first thing in relationship in other to build financial security for their kids. For instance, my niece did not start having babies until after 5 years of marriage, in which they claimed working hard to earn  more money before arrival of their offspring, and this made them stable financially. Moreso, some people believe maturity is essential before having children and maturity comes with age.

On the other hand, as having offsprings as an individual get older has upper hand, it also has downside. Having children at older age may cause medical complications to the mother and the baby. In 2021, A survey  carried out by midwives in Lagos State Nigeria, reveal that , some maternal complications is  as a result of having babies from thirty five years and above. Another thing,is that raising children at older age might be financial burdens due to retirement.

In conclusion, although bearing newborn as one get older has good side but, such as financial stability, creating good relationship among couple and maturity, but it might cause , prenatal and postnatal problems and financial hardship due to lack of job.",5
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that making primary schooling  free can be  fundamental to  guaranteeing everyone access to education . Some people believe that it can be considered an effective  solution to poverty. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view and think that free schooling is the best way to fight poverty.

Firstly, the Government should make elementary studies free of charge because it can help students  not alabelon school and then become  positive and productive members of  society . There are plenty of families  in developing nations that cannot fully afford to send their children to school. Consequently, these students  will be forced to alabelon their studies and be exposed to be unemployed and in some cases criminals in order to earn money to afford their living . For example , research shows that nations in which the level of unemployment is higher suffer more from economic problems . That is why this method can be a useful solution to this issue .

Secondly, primary learning helps children to develop several skills and abilities. In other words, education will help individuals to grow because they will obtain a better understanding of life and get more knowledge and skills . therefore , pupils  will gain financial stability  in the future because they may have the possibility to land a good job and a high-paying salary.

In conclusion , I strongly believe that making elementary free of charge can offer a long-term solution to the country's economy because it may reduce the problem of alabeloning schools   and  helps  children to develop  skills and abilities .",5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Most of the people throughout the world are interesting in searching on history of the place they live because of intelligence and they concern that they should be aware of it. In this situation, they are capable of finding out deeds and talking with inhabitants. In this essay, I am going to discuss    problems.

As a whole, human beings should be aware of the place they live in because nations are more intelligent nowadays. They might have many legitimate requirements. Furthermore, some are enthusiastic about those kinds of findings as they need to learn their children about the history of accommodation. For instance, when it is going to enrolling a child on a school, it is necessary to have proof of living place; whenever kids are asking about ancient times, it is necessary to have information of the past.

People could be able to find out historical information on where they live by deeds and inhabitant citizens because they are the most relevant and well-known factors which can be trusted.

For example, even though there are neighbours and compeers surrounded by,  it is impossible to get relevant data on a land accurately without a deed. That is how we are able to find the history of the place or house we live in.

In conclusion, I agree that all the people should be aware of ancient data on where we live by various sources described above clearly.",5
"Some people think parents should read or tell stories to children. Others think parents needn’t do that as children can read books or watch TV, movies by themselves. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","To the fact,parents are the first teachers to their kids,it is commonly believed that,storytelling by parents is really important.Whilst,others argue that,reading books and watching television can be done by the younger generation and parental intervention is not required.In this essay, I am going to discuss both the views and share my personal opinion.

Parents are the first persons who spend more time with children than anyone else.So,during the course of childhood,if parents are telling the stories taking some time out from their other work,children will be motivated towards the good manners and they will carry it when they grow.As we know,the first impression is the best impression.Furthermore,apart from  morality,the bond between the parents and children will become very strong which creates a lot of positivity in the children.For example,students who spent their childhood with parents behave well in school and on the other hand,youngers who did not spend their time with their parents act oddly.

It is also argued that,nowadays,children are capable enough to manage their work,including,reading books,watching television of their choice like cartoons or movies.If the parental impact is missing then it may lead to several negative ways on the children.In other words,children give importance to television than parents.For an instance,a past survey,reveals that more than 60 percent of children prefer to spend their time in front of the televison by enjoying their favourite program than seeing their mother or father.

In a conclusion,parents killing time with the children is very important for their children personal growth rather than allowing them to do their activities of their own.It is also suggested that,the more time parents spend with children in teaching them stories,the more good manners their children learn.",5
"Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is a polarizing topic  whether robots will prove to be instrumental to the development of human society in the forthcoming future or vice versa. Personally, although there are a few potential threats coming from the emergence of robotic engineering, I believe that the merits of this form of technology could eclipse its drawbacks. 

Yet it is unequivocally that robotic technology could fall into the wrong hand; therefore, it might be used to conduct immoral activity  or wage a war. For example, in the contemporary combat age, many cutting-edged devices have been adapted to practical combat, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles which are used to strike the enemy from distance. As a result, the life of many residents living in eras located in the war zone has been wreaked havoc as they have to deal with such hazardous confrontations  while worrying about losing their close friends and family. A prime example of this is Afghanistan, a country which has been under influence of America for over a century, citizens with  impoverished living conditions are ubiquitous here, and the waging of war has hindered their economy from thriving. 

However, in  light of robotic technological advances, human civilization has stepped another step into a brighter future, with many significant signs of progress in multi fields namely education, medicine, manufacturing, etc. Compared to  old-time manufacturing, good productivity in automatic factories has out manufactured in the past several times. By applying assembly lines to production, many ingredients could be transported and processed at the same time, which boosts productivity speed to great extent. Regarding the education sector, robotic adaption is the key factor in crafting novel and convenient methods of teaching, robotic lecturers which are programmed for a particular subject could convey detailed knowledge, while tailored-made learning programs enable learners to study at their own pace. 

In conclusion, it is advisable to grasp its advantages by spreading the use of  robots into every aspect of life, while finding a solution to reduce modern applications in  warfare.",5
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Needless to say, we are witnessing an alarming trend of  car over-usage. Starting from small towns to the metropolises, they are all full of an excessive number of vehicles on their roads. This essay will highlight the reasons for this modern-day issue along with would-be solutions. 

Nobody would argue with the fact that at the present day any consumer endeavours to obtain anautomobile by taking credit. Some individuals might consider this fact as a virtue, ,,however it exacerbates the situation on the roads. Moreover, there are various families where almost every member possesses a car inasmuch as many of them have a hectic lifestyle. Not only is it convenient to travel to work, but it is also considered to be prestigious.

However, the government in concert with local authorities can arrive at the solution by imposing heavy taxes on petrol. Consequently, most families would be confined to having one automobile for the whole family. Beyond any doubt, it will reduce the number of cars, and as a knock-off effect, decrease the amount of traffic congestion. In addition, in order to find an alternative , the option most avid drivers would consider switching to a bicycle, which certainly ensures the lack of potentially appalling traffic.

In summary, undoubtedly, today it has become trendy and necessary to own a personal vehicle. Therefore, the government is obligated to reduce traffic with the aid of either levying heavy taxes or supplying citizens with adequate road conditions in order to boost bicycle users among people.",5
The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent days, the Government set new rules to avoid road accidents. Some people believe stricter punishments for driver offences are the only way to improve road safety. I completely disagree with this statement. stricter punishment may reduce road accidents but it's not the only way. In this essay, I will discuss how other effective ways like good infrastructure, regular vehicle maintenance and awareness  improve road safety.

Firstly, Good roads might  avoid road accidents. If the government provides infrastructure like good roads, traffic lights, and speed breakers in right place, there is a high chance to avoid road accidents. For instance, UK authority well maintains their roads which reduce 20% of road accidents  every year. Likewise, regular vehicle maintenance helps to avoid road accidents. a person who drives a vehicle in the bad condition  face difficulties during driving which may lead to  severe accidents. The government set regulations to check the vehicle condition  every year might avoid this kind of accidents. For example, In India authorities should check the vehicle condition every year and provide an FC certificate, a person who drives a vehicle without an FC certificate should be punished.

Furthermore, the Administration set an awareness campaign about  road accident for  people may give more responsibility to  societies. communities had a lack of awareness about  road safety.Government should advertise the importance of wearing helmets as well as a seat belts to the people. For example, In 2016, Bajaj company set a campaign and they told how many  bikers are dead on highways because of not following the road rules.

In conclusion, punishment for the driving offence is one of the way to improve road safety but it's not the only way. Authorities also take responsibility to improve road safety.",5
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is a common belief that the best way discovering how to survive with climate change rather than preventing. I will elaborate this with supporting by inhibiting climate change.


In the modern life, the technology and consuming more than need is the essential reason  of climate change. Day by day, the ice where in the North is decreasing, also the temparature is rising. Over the years, all the scientists who research about methodology and environment sign to eliminate climate change. Obviously, the measurements cannot utilize to  the world a better place. For example, in a small town, all the cars and production centres have restricted since 2018 in my city. However, air pollution or other healing process in the environment has not appeared anymore. That is to say, the authorities should manage with more effective precautions. I will agree that if the people take care about climate change and solutions, all humanity will survive without any concern.


On the other hand, another belief supports living with the climate change may be supply benefits to us. Therefore, everybody can focus and adapt to new temperature or other change. Although, when it has not inhibited, it has been never ended. To rise temperature is a serious issue for the living organism. Even if they adapt these type of change, some type of organism cannot exist to suffer with a high temperature. Due to, the balance of the ecosystem can not heal, many of insects, birds, reptile will not have been in the new habitat. 


In conclusion, the best solution to eliminate climate change is preventing it and other issues related to it. Admittedly, the nature is fragile against the humanity, so we should treat more consciously. In addition, the authorities should be careful to solve and manage it.",7
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time . This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well . To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is highly debatable that adolescents should participate in unpaid community service during their leisure time. Many people believe this will have a positive impact on these youngsters and the public at large. I completely agree with the statement above and this essay will highlight some of the important merits of this service.

By participating in free work for the community, there are various pros to what these teens can achieve from the exercise. For example, their involvement in the neighbourhood clinic can help build their future ambition in this field of work. Consequently, these lads might eventually want to become a surgeon or nurses as they might get exposed to certain health problems that will encourage them to be better at life. As a result, they find a way of giving back what they learnt to 

the society by becoming a productive citizen.

Furthermore, having Young lads engage in volunteer services will help keep them away from a life of crime as they have less time to engage in it. For instance, peer pressure has a significant role to play in a young child’s life. In fact, having friends who participate in these activities will in turn help burst their willingness to participate and as such, their orientation will improve as they eventually become responsible and disciplined adults in the nearest future. 

In conclusion, it is crystal clear that engaging in  volunteer community services has a positive impact on teenagers by enriching some qualities that they might not have gotten by staying at home. This in turn helps most society by curbing teenage crime rates.",7
"some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. to what extent do you agree or disagree.","Climate development is the greatest threat to human life on earth. However, some people consider that instead of averting it, we should find a way to adapt to it.  Although there are convincing statements  on both sides, i believe that we still have to tackle this issue.

One of the main causes of temperature change is global warming. If both the government and people can take reasonable actions, this can be well controlled. For instance, the government can stop the generation of power from fossil fuels, which causes the emission of carbon and can be detrimental to the society. Also, the government can implement green taxes on industries that emit carbon-di-oxide, and invest in other renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Furthermore, individuals can try to limit their carbon footprint by flying less and using public transport.

Trying to live with climate revolution is a very dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming, the polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. Provided that there is an increase water sea level, natural disasters like flooding and drought are likely to occur. As a result, this will make people lose their homes and perhaps migrate to another country.

In conclusion,  weather diversity is becoming a pressing issue, I reiterate my opinion that there are different ways of tackling this problem by creating a new source of power and using less vehicles. Therefore, both the government and people have a role to play.",7
"It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.
In conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",7
"Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is argued by many people that history contains the lessons to help us understand human's life while others believe that we can hardly learn anything from the past. It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.
Some people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.
It is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.
In summary, we can learn a lot from history and history is important for human development.",7
Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental degradation is a rising issue in the contemporary world. According to the number of people, the surge in the price of fuel is a way to mitigate this problem. I agree up to some extent, however, there are other major solutions, mainly restricting waste disposable and deforestation.

Admittedly, increasing the cost of the fuel is a basic option to cope with the environmental issue. Price hike of the ammunition such as petrol and diesel means, less private vehicles usage, as people would opt to other options for transportation such as public transport system; hence air will not be polluted, as there would be less smoke released from vehicles. China, for instance, in 2016, had been able to decrease the air pollution up to 13%, by introducing fuel’s price increase. Thus, price increase of ammunition is one of the basic measure of saving the environment.

On the other hand, I think there are other effective strategies to address the nature related problems. Firstly, banning waste disposable from industries and factories is one way of solving the rising water pollution issue. This is because disposable materials produced from different industries drained off in the sea and contaminate the water. Which in turn is devastating for sea animals. Another viable option is to discourage deforestation. Cutting trees lead to the deficiency of Oxygen, which is an immense requirement for the better environment. For example, International organization of climate protection has conducted a study that each year climate is becoming deteriorating by the 25% decrease in the production of Oxygen, owing to the deforestation. Therefore, controlling disposable products and prohibiting cutting trees enormously assist in keeping the environment safe.

In conclusion, to control the degradation of nature is a sparked topic these days. Some people say that increasing the fuel cost is a way. In my view, this will be helpful up to some extent, but there are other efficient measures such as preventing raw disposable materials and cutting trees.

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In the present age, many people believe that art plays a vital role in children's lives and should be mandatorily included in their subject at educational institutions while others think it's not necessary to include it as a subject. This essay will highlight the merits and demerits of art subject in kids life at school. In my opinion, I support the former statement.

On the one hand, individuals think that  art is an essential subject for teenagers as it helps them to express their views and emotions through colours and pencils. Moreover, art also helps them in improving their learning methodology. Meanwhile, with the help of sketching and paintings juveniles can show their creativity to the world. For example, Artist Tahsin Akhtar, painting got selected in the U.K animal welfare art gallery for showing the cruelty towards the animals.

On the other hand, the community think that children nowadays are fully loaded with their studies, and should more concentrate on subjects which will help them in future thus, wasting time on arts subjects. Eventually, making drawings and paintings consume a lot of time and kids gets tired and as a ,result teenagers are not able to focus more on studies. Such as, my nephew takes 5-6 hours in completing a drawing which not only makes him tired but after a time inactive also as as a result, he scored fewer marks in other subjects.

In conclusion, Art plays an important role in one's life, as they can share their emotions and unsaid words through paintings but on the other ,hand it takes a lot of time which impact juvenile study. In my opinion, art should be a necessary subject for children at school as it helps them to open up in a society with their art style.",7
Nowadays people have cosmetic surgery to improve life. Why do many more people choose these operations? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people turning to cosmetic surgery. This phenomenon is caused by various reasons and it has stirred up many heated arguments on whether cosmetic surgery is a positive or negative trend. Personally, I see myself siding with the former.

People’s recent preference for cosmetic surgery is said to stem from a number of factors. To begin with, the higher demand for plastic surgery is due to the fact that nowadays, people seem to care more about their physical appearance than ever before, as such, they develop a desire to look more attractive. Therefore, when this mindset is taken into consideration, it is not difficult to explain why there is a rapid growth in the number of people undertaking plastic operations. In addition, the incredible and meteoric development of technology in recent times further contributes to the widespread use of cosmetic procedures. The utilization of highly advanced machinery undoubtedly results in increased efficiency, quality, as well as safety, allowing patients to put more trust in the process.

In my opinion, an individual's wish to become more beautiful is not something that should be criticized or ridiculed owning thank to the fact that

an attractive and pleasing physical appearance can be greatly beneficial, such as remarkably boosting a person’s confidence and self-esteem, or improving one’s sense of happiness. Consequently, I am convinced cosmetic surgery is a viable method for those who want to refine their looks. Nevertheless, it is unwise to abuse plastic surgery, as overusing this method can lead to various health issues. When an individual undertakes a plethora of operations, an exceedingly large quantity of risks will become apparent, these consequences include blood loss, organ damage or even more horrifying, death.

In conclusion, in recent times, cosmetic surgery has greatly soared in popularity, mostly thanks to the fact people are becoming more and more conscious of their outward appearance. In my point of view, the fact that people can have their ideal appearance through cosmetic operations is a positive development, though it would be completely inappropriate to heavily overuse it.",7
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","It is becoming increasingly interesting for people to find out the background story of the house or building they reside in. The major reason behind this is curiosity about their residents. Some ways could be done to research the history, such as interviewing the local neighbourhoods, going to libraries or searching it online. 

There are some motives for people to explore the past of the place where they live. Firstly, it is because curiosity is the nature of human beings. Therefore, they tend to wonder about the origin of something, including their residents. This exploration could be beneficial for  homeowners since they can gather information about their houses and the important histories behind them. As an example, in the Conjuring movie, the homeowner and the paranormal tried to find the history of the house in order to reveal the reasons behind the haunted experience that the homeowner experienced. By gathering the data, they could also find out about the old times of the building’s structure, whether it ever experienced a disaster or something else, so when they want to renovate it, they would take some precautionary measures to avoid the same things that happened before. 

There are some kinds of activities that could help the owner to reveal the secrets of their residents. First, they can ask their neighbours about the house. It could be an effective way if the person that they interviewed has lived there for a long time. Additionally, local people are familiar with the surroundings. Therefore, they could give a specific story about the house. Secondly, the local library could be one of the options if the authority has good documentation about the area. To illustrate, the government of the Dutch East Indies has a good archive of Surabaya’s maps, which will give advantages in the research. Lastly, we could utilize the Internet. The internet provides a bunch of information that can be accessed by the public. For example, Google Maps has a feature to look back at the old maps in real view, which helps us to find out the chronicles. 

To conclude, people like to discover the past stories of their buildings because they are curious about them. They could learn that information by asking the local community, reading some materials from the local libraries, or the Internet.",7
"Many university students cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","It is widely known that there are many university graduates who are unable to work in their desired fields after they finish their studies. This essay will elucidate the causes behind this phenomenon and offer solutions to tackle the problems.

To begin with, the most common reason is the fact that fresh graduates usually do not have the technical skills that their chosen profession requires. Possessing technical knowledge is an essential factor that employers consider when assessing job applicants. Meanwhile, university students tend to focus more on theoretical aspects rather than practical sides. Furthermore, this circumstance is exacerbated by limited job availability due to  increasing competition in job markets. To cite an example, there are fewer jobs in government institutions than the number of students holding a degree in political science. 

Nonetheless, there are certainly some steps that can be taken to face those challenges. Firstly, university students should take internship jobs prior to applying to full-time jobs. Having more exposure to the professional world, students can identify the practical skills they need in order to excel in those jobs. After completing internships, they can also consider finding jobs in different cities to increase the probability of finding their dream occupations. For instance, they can try to browse jobs in the top five largest cities in their country. 

In conclusion, the main rationales that hinder university graduates from getting their desired profession are twofold, they are the lack of technical abilities and the low number of job postings. University students can mitigate these by joining internship programs and expanding their job-searching efforts",7
Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Instruction of young individuals is highly emphasised in many nations. However, some communities believe that tutoring adults who do not have proficiency is even more vital, and governments should spend more funds on this. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the statement given, and I will elaborate on it in this essay.

On the one hand, today, some nations have compulsory education so their youngsters can learn knowledge in school. Moreover, when they back to their home, their caregivers can assist them so they learn more. However, some families have inhospitable environments for children in which those people cannot learn reading and writing skills in their house. For example, if their mother or father is an alcoholic, they cannot teach their offspring and some use violence to heat their scions, so they feel afraid to learn everything. As a result, they do not have any bills, so we must spend funds on those young folks.

Furthermore, the majority of adults can get a job which can earn salaries, and it is not an illegal thing. But, in many countries, heirs cannot get a job because of the law. In addition, numerous youngsters are influenced by adults, so if they cannot receive cash from their government, they will lose their opportunity to learn literacy. For instance, in South Korea, many old communities cannot write or read because, when they were young individuals, South Korea was at war, so they could not learn literacy. But when they become adults, they can learn writing and reading skills. Therefore, we must protect children from those environments.

In conclusion, I completely disagree with this topic. Children who have bad guardians, cannot enough learn literacy. Conversely, many adults can learn those skills because they can get a job as well as pay. So, we should spend money on those young people because they are precious people in our lives.",7
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Present-day most of the countries are still developing and some of the nations are below the poverty line because of a lack of facilities like health,education and a proper government system.To reduce the poverty in developing countries giving  free education for up to 6 years is not the  best way to reduce the poverty.I partially agree  with the statement.Because  giving free education cannot bring  growth to countries ,

First and foremost not only education but also giving proper employment and  health care  to society which helps the nation.Education plays a crucial role because when the country has full of education and skilful people which help the nations to grow rapidly.By simply giving free education is not only  the solution the government should provide they can give or spend some money in to get a  quality education to children or youngsters which help them to gain knowledge and the skills can be help in increase the economic growth.For example,  Singapore  is a developed country because  every citizen in the country provides them with  a  quality education and free education for their citizens.

On the other hand,when the countries have a strong relationship with some nations if the government can build a relationship with some of the developed countries so it can help them to decrease their poverty.like exporting and importing the materials or metals so that state can make money by selling them ,However this can help us our nations to increase the growth in every sector like health and transport .Then the countries can use this financial money into proper schooling which can help the nations to decrease  poverty.

In conclusion, according to me  the statement which I was giving when the countries  having a strong relationship between  some other  nations which can help the developing countries.So that they become well in financial and economic growth ,by spending this money in major sectors like education,health and transportation.",7
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It has been claimed that economic increase in rich countries does not imply more satisfaction for their citizens. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement for two reasons. The first one is that I think that getting richer, even if the person is already rich, will probably make the person feel better, and the second one is that I do not agree with generalizing people’s feelings.

Firstly, we cannot deny that improving the economy in a rich country would contribute to the better well-being of people, increasing their life quality standards. One example of this is Finlandia, this country is one of the happiest nations in the world and its wealth index is enormous. People have time to dedicate to their families instead of working all day and children attend school only for three hours, having the best education system with the highest educational standards. All this contributes to an improvement of the national economy, making feel its citizens happier as their work-life balance gets better. 

Secondly, I think that the majority of citizens may be happier in case of economic improvement. However, not everything in life is about the economy, and I think that this may be related to why some people are not feeling better with this “good news”. Nowadays, individuals are very confused about life, and even if they are wealthy, money cannot resolve what a person feels or desires. Statistics show the highest suicide rates in the richest countries, which proves that being economically stable and rich does not guarantee happiness.

In conclusion, even if some experts believe that an additional increase in the economy in a rich country would not make a difference among their citizens, I think that it would definitely contribute to the better well-being of most people increasing their quality of life standards and satisfaction levels. However, some sectors of society may be experiencing other issues in their lives that do not let them pain attention to other good things, like feeling happier because their country and their people are acceding to a better lifestyle standard. The economy may benefit people and bring stability into their lives but it cannot guarantee happiness for everyone.",7
Some people think the government  should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environmental problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is considered by some individuals, that the authorities ought to elevate the prices of fuel, which are used in automobiles, in order to settle the environmental pollution. I partially agree with this statement, because only with increasing the cost of fossil fuel may not solve this problem,  but there are many other options such as the production of more electrically driven vehicles, reduction of the import of fossil fuel-driven automobiles as well as implementing new lawsuits,should be considered  to minimize this environmental crisis.

To begin with, the mission of unfavourable gases such as carbon monoxide from petroleum driven vehicles is a great burden to the environment.These gases cause the 

greenhouse effect which leads to global warming and many more problems. When the cost of fuel is low people tend to purchase more vehicles as their maintenance cost is lower. This can indirectly increase the traffic jam and subsequently elevates  environmental pollution. For example, in countries with low oil prices, the annual sales of automobiles also considerably high. Therefore, by increasing the prices of fossil fuel, consumption will also be reduced and it will indirectly support the environment

However, the elevation of the prices of fossil fuel is not the only answer for the environmental crisis but there are many more logical solutions for this. For instances, the production of  electrically-driven automobiles, as well as reduction of the import of petrol and diesel vehicles can be considered. Moreover, it should be considered to plant more trees in the city areas and this will purify the air and reduce  warming. Empowering citizens by means of protecting their own surrounding is one of the most important  aspects to be considered. As an example, in Sidney,they have reduced the air pollution by  40% with the theme of ""go green "".

In conclusion, It is evident that, although  environmental pollution can be controlled by raising the cost of fuel, there are many other successful methods to solve this global problem.",7
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Arguably, it is commented that entities  trading in a specific region should not only be focused on profiting. However,  they should  care for the local communities. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since  enterprises  have responsibilities to  develop neighbourhoods. Although this development is highly criticised by  managers. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. 

On the one hand,  businesses are accountable for  the local  district  advancement. In other words,  once they  are exploring  raw materials, lands or other sorts of goods or services inward  communities they should  bear  their expenses. For instance, a Mozambique's company, Mozal is  devoted to aluminium exploitation in the Beluluane area, once it is  making money through the raw material of this  small area, the enterprise builds schools, roadways, and  employs the local  youth. As a result,  both  are the  greater winners, the local folk and  the company. It is the overriding reason for high develop small  lands  in Spain. 

On the other hand,  shareholders regard  social responsibility  as  financial resources consuming.  Because of the escalated  quantity of resources  utilized in  social activities,  the owners of these  institutions  criticise the development.  60% of   business institutions  are found it a hardship  to help  societies where they operate to exemplify. It is pointed out by the new research carried out by the University  of Southampton.  Hence,  there are  soared conflicts between  the  businesses owners and communities.  Moreover, It is the  prime  purpose for the shortfall in an agreement between woodcutters and the African crowd.

To sum up, notwithstanding the lack of support from the shareholders of businesses,  these explorers  should  collaborate  and help  the local livings owing to the fact that they  lately  depend on the local resources.  Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. I would go as far as to say, the local regime instils stricter measures to protect throng interests.",11
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","The number of people who are interested in seeking the history of the building or house in some countries even increase. There are two reasons why society does it, and how they execute it. 

Firstly, avoiding any conflicts that are likely to happen in the future can be the main reason why people become interested to find out about the past. Nowadays, especially in villages, swindlers of landlords should be watched out to prevent problems. They usually offer lands that have no buildings on them to others who do not domicile in that village. The buyers are possibly to quarrel with the real owner later. Secondly, they want to check whether the house or building deserves to live. They are curious about the past story of the place. Sometimes, they also wonder about the myths of the building. 

In order to seek the history, buyer candidates are likely to ask the community around the building and check the legality of the document. Through the information gotten from the neighbours, they will get an insight into the story behind it. Since the neighbours are the closest parties, they know either the told or untold story around it. Also, they can check the official certificate. The cleverer buyer candidates will see this matter as prevention due to the existence of the swindlers. The certificate will tell who the legal owner of the building is. 

In conclusion, people are interested to find the history of a building to prevent problems that may come later and eliminate any hesitancy towards the building. Furthermore, they can do it by asking the neighbours and checking the legal document.",10
Some people believe that scientists have more influence over the world whereas others argue that politician have more influence over the world. Discuss both the views and give your opinion?,"It is often believed that the planet is more impacted by the people who have expert knowledge in physical or natural science, while others argue that it is generally influenced by persons, who are especially involved in politics. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the former view.  

On the one hand, those who believe legislative can have a significant impact over the globe is likely to be limited. Although the prominent law-making decisions and international treaties between neighbour countries could be build-up by the specific politicians,  it would be helped to their citizens of the particular country. To illustrate this, the economic policies of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh has brought up INDIA way  in the eyes of the whole world, but the most might be benefitted by this are their permanent residences. Therefore, their impact applies to among people of the country merely.

On the other hand, I would argue that scientists can be hugely impacted in many countries as compared to politicians. This reason behind this is that their advancement in technology and medical science may provide assistance to a large number of people, which are also included public servants, who tend to use their unique inventions and upgrade to the country equipment such as fighter jets and satellites. For instance, the Internet and the Mobile phones are the best ever inventions made by Vinton Cerf and Martin Cooper which are used by people of every corner of the earth. It can be reached to a million people and this may result become more influential.

In conclusion, despite the politicians of specific country impose the significant rules and regulations on their citizens, which are quite helpful for them but it is limit to some extent because they are not as influential as technological experts which are impact more on the people of the world.",10
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement ? (approximately 250 words),"It is sometimes argued about the importance of the existence of public areas such as squares and parks in modern societies. While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.

On the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American culture’s trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Year’s Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  

On the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.

In conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",10
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or the building they live in.


What are the reasons for this?


How can people reseach this?","People around the world are becoming more and more interested to find out about the past of the house or building that they reside in. This passage will examine the reasons and how we can research the history of where they live.

There are numerous reasons why the families want to know what had happened in the past. Curiosity is one of the reasons why they are interested as these families want to know if something bad had happen. For example, a family might get to know that the building they reside in might be once occupied by terrorists or the building was built illegally. Moreover, there might also be a chance that the building they live in was once used to be the home of a famous actor, due to which the value of the building might increase.

There are various ways how we can research to find what had happened to the home or building that they live in.
