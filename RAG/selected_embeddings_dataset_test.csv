In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What is your opinion about it?,"In contemporary settings, due to the prevalence of the feminist movement, more and more females are hired in some industries which conventionally are the domains of males. The contributors of this transformation will be discussed in this essay along with the reasons why I believe this is a blessing rather than a curse. Multiple factors facilitate this trend.

 To be more specific, an increasing number of women receive tertiary education and thus, the professional knowledge obtained from such experience enables them to enter / join some companies, working as engineers, scientists and lawyers. In addition, several decades ago, most tasks were performed by hand, which made men in an advantageous position due to their relatively stronger bodies. By contrast, nowadays, the vast majority of manual jobs are performed by machines, and the requirement for workers is not strength but the skills of operating these mechanics, which makes the females on a par with their male counterparts. 

This improvement exerts a positive influence on both females and their families. Women are always detail-oriented, so if they are working as scientists or doctors, they have higher chances of obtaining huge success. A good example is a female scientist Madame Curie who attributed her success in the discovery of the element Ra to the fact that she identified the minor difference in their daily research outcomes. Consequently, by focusing on these divergences and doing deep research, she found the element and reaped a breakthrough in their research. Besides, formerly, the roles of women were confined to being housewives, which earned them no salaries. Hence, their families depended on their huslabels’ salaries, but in  modern times, the combined salaries of both huslabels and wives enable them to have better lifestyles.

In conclusion, the reasons for the increase in women’s involvement in work which used to be done by men are their educational qualifications and the development of technologies which eliminate manual labour.",8
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In recent times, most families chose to attain eld before bearing offspring. I personally believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages as this can lead to some complications during labour. These points will be further explained in the subsequent paragraphs with appropriate examples.

To begin,  women conceiving at later stages are associated with it's own merit which is attaining financial stability before becoming parents. Marriage is a union that results in the production of children at the desired time as agreed by the couples. Money is a standing factor that enhances growth in a relationship,  therefore not giving birth immediately after marriage, helps both man and woman to plan ahead for the future as well as creating sufficient time to build experiences and gather ideas.

However, late childbearing also has its own demerits which are complications during delivery. Experience, ideas and resources can be acquired longer in marriage but death as a result of health conditions developed by an old first-time mother can not be reversed. According to research, male and female are most productive between years 25- 32. Although pregnancy is viable outside those ages. Critical health cases could be diagnosed such as foetal or maternal death,  fibroid, uterine rupture, cervical laceration,  eclampsia and bleeding during and after delivery may occur. Early child production will help avoid this demerit. For example,  I recently had an encounter with a woman who got wedded at 28 years but waited till age 33 before conceiving. Unfortunately, she lost her strength during labour which led to caesarian section and post-partum bleeding.

In conclusion,  the accumulation of enough ideas about marriage as well as finances is an excellent decision. However,  the terrible health complications caused by late childbearing can not be overlooked.",7
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are controversial views about whether economic developments could address indigence and famine or harm the natural world. I believe national and local authorities should limit the growth business world, due to its pollution.

On the one hand, many advocates for the growth of the economy would solve hunger and poverty. In other words, cash crops and other modern business operations not only supply sufficient food for the ever-increasing population but also generate profit for the rich and create jobs for workers. By earning money, impoverished families might improve the standard of living and afford their children’s education. However, there are two drawbacks of this approach. Firstly, the profit generated from many industrial sectors benefit merely investors, not their employees and poor people. Secondly, the natural world is at the expense of the industrialisation and modernisation of humankind. For example, many lakes are now polluted because of the toxic waste discharged by factories.

On the other hand, while economic increase could be a stopgap measure for hunger and indigence, the environmental problems it causes must be recognised, so governments should introduce restrictions on numerous economic sectors. To be specific, the innovative industry is at the root of environmental degradation. In the last decade, governments and companies have sped their development rates and made a vast fortune, leading to more frequent and severe catastrophes, such as floods and droughts, which account for the starvation and poverty occurring in developing nations. Therefore, curbing modern businesses is a means of natural conservation.

In conclusion, although some individuals believe the answer to starvation and indigence would lie in the evolution of the economy, I would argue that this development results in environmental problems. As a result, the development of the economy must be limited.",11
Some people decided to have children in their late age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, with the development of many types of life such as urbanization, the development of industries, etc that makes people become busier and busier. They have to obey the circulation of life and their attitudes have to be changed to come up with their life. One of the significant changes is that more and more families tend to have children at a late age than in the past. This essay will discuss this phenomenon through various relevant examples to support it.

With regard to the merits, there are at least 2 advantages that can be observed when bearing children late. According to the decision, the couples can have much time to prepare and sort out their life before having some new members to the family. Before bearing a kid, they have to suffer from the calculation of the financial burden. They have to make sure about their abilities to take care of any kids in their home. Because of the issues, more and more couples believe they ought to stand in an ideal position before doing that great task. Last but not least, this is a period for the young families to enjoy themselves more. For example, with the exception of crowded outdoor life, that is the time for couples to enjoy together through many trips, picnic… and enjoy the feeling of the wonderful youth.

On the other hand, people have to suffer from no less than 2 main drawbacks belonging to this phenomenon. Initially, this can reduce the success rate of conception in women. Because each lady has a period of ideal ages to bear. The more ages they have, the more difficult they concept successfully. Secondly, this can restrict the number of offspring that can be born per family. When more and more families do not want to bear, this will affect the quality of the population chart and this will be a burden on the economy of any country. Finally, this phenomenon can lead to the lack of mental health of any offspring in the old parents compared to the young parents. When every people achieve a determined age, they wouldn’t have enough health and enthusiasm to experience new things. So, it’s a massive lack of children who have old daddy and mommy when they don’t have a trip to explore the new destinations or the bigger generation gap compared to the younger family.

The happiness of any parents is seeing the total growth of every child of them. To take this, every father and mother, let’s choose a suitable age to start making their own nuclear family, not too old but not too young, to bring an ideal environment for kids to grow and become a wonderful continuous generation in the future.",6
Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Universities are offering many online courses for the convinience of people. Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.
Prima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.
While remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.
In a nutshell though online education comes with some good feature but can never replace the physical/regular education system.",6
some people think the best way to solve global enviromental problems is to increase the cost of fuel to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Every country faces global environmental problems and they are very concerned about how to decrease those problems. Although, it is sometimes thought the best way to solve it to increase the cost of fuel. In my opinion, I considered that environmental issues can be solved in different manners.

There are several reasons to decline the matter of global environmental. The first and foremost important thing is that to ban the single-use of plastic. Plastic is a non-biodegradable item and it is very harmful to the environment. For instance, in one survey has conducted in the UK, 50% of environmental causes are happened by plastic. In addition, if government take a strict action against use of plastic such as plastic bottles, straws, carry bags and so on so,it is possible to reduce that problem.

Another point to consider to solve the environmental problem is to encourage people for more plantations. In big cities, more people are doing deforestations to build tall buildings and industries and it is also affects weather changes. For example, without trees it is very hard to keep the air clean and neat and people are getting a lack of rain. Hence, palnts and trees are the best way to stop that problems.

On the other hand, fuel is responsible for getting more issues in environment. nowadays persons prefer their own vehicles for transportations and this trend is booming. In addition, raising the cost of fule could be help to fall down the global warming.

In conclusion, numerous ways are available to solve the global environmental issues and government should encourage people to use  renewable things and try to solve them.",3
Some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"In this contemporary era, in several countries, knowing the history of the properties has been interesting for the owners. In my opinion, various reasons are affecting people to think about the past times. I am also convinced that they can enquire about these buildings from different resources. 

It is my view that what absorbs people is the sense of connection. To put it in another way, people find it intriguing to be knowledgeable in possessing’ history as they feel closer to that house. Moreover, not only does it enhance the connection with ancient people but also it enriches individuals’ curiosity. Therefore, numerous people have a personal interest in history and the history of their owners gives them an opportunity to fulfil this personal passion. For example, an ancient building in Kave Street was for one of the king’s ministers which resulted in a written book by its owner, owing to research and gaining information about that building and the past.

I further believe that people can augment their knowledge by enquiring about the elderly of that neighbourhood and the municipality plays a substantial role as well. In addition, some online websites can assist people in this field. For instance, the public can search for the roots of constructed palaces and their reasons on different websites. Although people should ensure that those sites are trustworthy, rarely does it happen that the government’s sites share wrong information.

To conclude, augmenting the connection with possess and their personal interest brings about research about the history of that building. From my perspective, the public can enquire from the elderly and use the municipalities’ websites to raise their awareness about the property.",6
"Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Many people have expressed that a number of reports detailing crime news should be controlled, as they have many negative effects on society. I partly agree with this view.

On the one hand, I believe the bad influences that stem from two main reasons. Firstly, the direct result of crime news with extremely details are to bring victims psychological injury. To pique readers’ interest, the media may use the bloody images and exaggerated language. This reminds me of a school murder that occurred in China.The local media had numerous reports on the atrocious detail of crimes. Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate. It not only to victim's mental health caused some damage, but also to the whole community to bring about a great potential threat. So the media should not report too many details of crimes to the public. 

On the other hand, the crime news can serve as a public warning. People can enhance their guarding consciousness in order to avoid becoming a victim, and also  assist the police in remaining alert. For example, the media report criminal news in a public place to arouse our social concern. The police can use this information to strengthen the force of supervision in this areas.

In conclusion, I argue that detail of crimes in the media are likely to invite various problems, and we should limit them to protect people from harm.",5
"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Countries around the world rely on economic growth as it plays an integral part in its growth. While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.

On one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic wideninig, if improved, can lead to decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to this development for example, if a person gets quality education, this will align to the self development of that individual as well as contributes to the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacture goods, services, etc. As a  result of this it will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he/she from sufferings like poverty. Provided that the employment growth can be accelerated and this in turn safeguards people from not being able to meet their basic needs.",0
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","No doubt, parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children. Since children are too young to understand what is right or wrong, it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in the right direction. Hence, I agree with the argument that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their minor children.

Children have impressionable minds. They acquire their values and morals from their parents. For instance, kids born in a good family often listen to good words and moral stories from the elderly family members. Therefore, when they find themselves in a difficult or unfavourable situation, they know how to keep their emotions in check and behave politely. This restraint that they learn from their family will prevent them from acting aggressively and getting into trouble.

By contrast, a child coming from a bad family may assimilate the bad qualities of their parents. Since they often get exposed to verbal and physical abuse they will assume that violence and aggression are normal and acceptable. It is only a matter of time before they commit crimes outside the home. For example, in India, the mother of a 14 year old boy was penalized for allowing her son to drive a four wheeler. The boy caused an accident and the judge who heard the case held his mother responsible because in his opinion, it was her duty to prevent her underage son from driving. Thus, obviously, parents are responsible for the actions of their children.

To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that the role of parents in raising law abiding citizens with social commitment is of utmost importance. Hence, I believe that parents should be held accountable for the wrong acts of their children.",9
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","When thinking about whether their children should be taught by teachers at school or educated themselves at home, most parents probably fall somewhere into two extremes. On the one side is the approach taken by most ordinary parents, who have made great endeavours to send their children to the most prominent schools.  

On the other is the view expressed by an increasing number of writers, film stars and artists that the normal education system is unsuitable for their children and its necessity and value are yet to be confirmed. From my perspective, parental education itself could not take the place of school.   

It is widely admitted that some parents are already the best teachers in certain areas, such as music, painting, writing and vice versa. For those parents, they tend to find what the normal school taught is useless and even harmful to their children's development. However, they overlook two facts. 

For one thing, besides being a place for learning, school also functions as a communication center where various views and comments are equally expressed and exchanged, which parents could not easily replace. After all, an artist or a writer that has already made prominent contributions to one area is more likely to be biased when it comes to opposite voices unless they do not have faith in what they are working on. Nevertheless, a child needs to weigh in diversified facts in their perspective rather than replicate what their parents think.   

For another, children could also benefit from school life even if nothing was learned. At school, peers gather together and they gradually learn to cooperate and communicate efficiently with each other. Furthermore, witnessing children with different personality or even from various cultures, they figure out the importance of embracing differences and finally the colorful world.   

All in all, missing the opportunity of school results in loss of diversity and failure to acquire interpersonal skills. Hence, its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.",4
"Some people think that robots are important for human's future devlopment. Others think that robots have negative effects on society.

Discuss both  views and give your opinion?","Some would argue that robots are beneficial for peoples upcoming development,while others think that robots have detrimental impacts on community.While robots have some influences in the number of employees and cannot handle unexpected situations ,I believe that they have a significant role in the repetitive industrial activities and working in hazardous environments.

On the one hand,increasing capabilities of robots in functioning complex tasks will eventually eliminate some human jobs.Many companies and industries are replacing their workers by robots to save money and time.This ascendancy of robots in performing different fields of job will affect many people financially and mentally.As robots also depend on human programming,it can be dangerous for any mistaken or in unexpected circumstances.Foe example,in USA it is revealed that driveless cars can not make good judgments in their surrounding and they involve in many tragic accidents.However,I believe that robots are essential in humans future advances,because they can handle strenuous and unsafe jobs.

In the other hand,it is taught that because robots are automated they are important in the accomplishment of unchangeable tasks and they are also viable in dangerous areas.Androids have the ability of lifting heavy loads and in the manufacturing,assembling,packing,and packaging of items precisely,Which cab be very exertion.tough and boring jobs for human being.The artificial intelligence of this machines in doing things perfectly on time allows people to save time and spend it on jobs and other different activities that require full concentration.Robots can also perform effective results in harmfull situations.They used to detect dispose harmful materials for human health in industries.For example,they can be used to inspect chemical factories where radiation,toxic chemicals or explosive gases pose significant risks to human employers.I believe that,robots are necessary for future development because workers can save time and are able to manage and maintain efforts to acquire new knowledges and skills,they also help employees to stay safe in the processing of risky chemicals.

In conclusion,although robots decline the number of employees and can  cause accidents,they changed the industrial and other systems of the world revolutionary that is why they are vital for next generations progressing.",3
"Detailed describtion of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be banned in the media.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days that the details of crimes affect badly on  society if it described in newspapers or TV. Therefore, this kind of information should be banned in the media. This essay will discuss this issue and will draw my personal opinion.

On one hand, I totally agree with this argument for various reasons. The first reason is affecting badly on the kids. Children are the main part of  society and they usually spend more time in front of the TV . The second reason i",0
"In some citites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.","The pie charts display the online shopping sales for retail departments in Canada from 1980 to 2000. Overall, it can be seen that higher education dominated and received the highest record all years.

To be specific, in term of education sector, Health and human resources ratio was flucturated starting with 14% in 1980, 20% in 1990 and 10% in last year. Similarly, transportation also encountered this trend from 16% at start to sharply declining at 6% in 1990 and skyrocketed to 22% in 2000.

On the other hand, although higher education took most of sales, K-12 education and other faced slowly decreased from 25% to 18% and 6% to 1% respectively. Inversely, steady increase was found in Environment services from 4% in 1980 to 9% in 2000.",0
"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are extremely argumentative statements heating up a debate over whether people should learn more about their family in the past or put more concentration on their current and future generations. While some claim that it is essential to know about family history, others make a strong view that present and future generations should be taken into great consideration. I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned ideas. 

Without a shadow of a doubt, I think that understanding family history is extremely imperative to each person, it can bring numerous benefits. One of those is that they can have more assistance in their society from many other relatives. In other words, when we research our family trees, we can have contact with more relations that we have not ever known before. By doing so, we can get more help from them in a place far from home. For example, if you are a student and you want to study in foreign lands, such as France, Germany and so forth, you should know about your relatives in those lands in order that you can get numerous useful help during your learning journeys. Thus, I believe that perceiving our own family backgrounds is significantly important because we can have support from our unknown relations when we need.   

While the importance of learning family trees is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of concentrating on present and later generations is ignored. Focusing on guiding the present and forthcoming generations can make our society better. To be particular, when we focus on educating our descendants, they can become a quality workforce in the future, which can contribute to social development. For example, Vietnamese people always try numerous ways to fully improve their successors, which make Vietnam become one of the fastest developing countries in Asia now. Hence, putting attention on the current and upcoming generations is significantly crucial for community improvement.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that both studying our family in the past and concentrating on educating our current and upcoming generations are equally significant in different aspects. Therefore, from my perspective, it is vital that we not only research our family trees but also give existing and next generations great priority.",6
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","When buying a new house or a flat in a building, one of the initial question that comes up is: who had lived in that place. Even if you forgot asking any such questions in the begining, when planning to sell the property people frequently ask about previous history of the house and all the residents ever lived in it. This could be because of the curiosity. Whether a prominent person had ever shared the place or it could be a anxiousness driven by fear; if any mishappening had occured at the place.

When purchasing or selling a house, history of all previous owners is of profound interest. Feeling like curiosity or fear drive such a question. For instance, whether a crime had ever happened at the house or in the building, or any illegal activity was performed the the residence. Also curiosity to know if a famous person had lived in that place. Such questions will impact the sale of the property and  it can go either ways, based on the history of type of people lived there.

To gain knowledge on such a topic, a realtor is the first best person to ask before buying the place. And later, neighbours are the one who could help you out discoverying the facts and the history of the house. If you are still not satisfied, you can approach the government body dealing in the housing management. They have all the records of all the previous owners. Or if you are living in a building, there must be a management company. Ask them any reasonable question regarding the past of that building. 

In conclusion, I would say feelings like fear and curiousity leads to questions on the history of the house. A realtor, neighbours and management companies can assist in attaining such a information.",3
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, the concept of the phenomenon has become widespread, referring to people who have become famous for their lifestyle. Sometimes the youth try to pretend to be like them. To my mind, it may have several negative consequences.

It is a simple supply-demand pattern, in which they try to provide the audience with something more required. Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events. This could be a bad example for teenagers who take them as role models. When the life they want is not offered, they can become depressed and, worse, rebel against their families or can behave inappropriately. 

In fact, some celebrities are often found in smoking advertisements, charged with drugs and other criminal activities. A young person who chooses this kind of famous person as an idol will be able to damage their health. Another example can be the impact of a particular celebrity's bad roles in films or series. For instance, Sanjay Dutt, Bollywood Actor is well known for his money and roles as a villain, his terrorist acts in different movies have given rise to violence and crime in the streets of Mumbai, all these were committed by adolescents for thrill and adventure.

In brief, because of the information age, children and adolescents are informed by watching TV, using social networks, and can follow celebrities on these platforms as their role models. If the younger generation is not properly guided, such things can have bad effects on them.",8
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Thanks to the development of the world, life has been easier for most people living on the Earth. However, the convenience of the modern world has built up the laziness and other factors which make its residents acquire a negative lifestyle. Discussions have been raised whether to pay national budget for sick individuals or to elevate a healthy lifestyle. While critics consider infected people to be worth paying, I believe promoting beneficial lifestyles must be the priority.

        Not surprisingly, healthy ways of living provide inhabitants variety of profits. People who process a positive lifestyle enhance both physical mental heal day by day, which contribute to their joyful life. These residents tend to have the ability to cope with stress, complex problems and develop a strong resistance to diseases. As a result,the number of infected cases would shrink sharply, which can one day end the vicious circle of paying for those people. In addition, scientists and researches had proved that living with healthy lifestyles is a way to lengthen our duration of life.

        Another striking point is that negative lifestyles would be promoted passively by the investment of government in treating infected patients. Since these patients are supplied financially with their treatment, people tend  to have a minor concern about the way they are living. As a consequence, residents tend to maintain their bad living habits regardless of the troubles they might bring.

        In conclusion, I restate that the state budget should be invested for elevating profitable lifestyles. If governments divide public money to both areas logically, I believe the whole society would be dvantaged.",5
"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some poeple think that interviews is not a reliable mthod of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Interviews are a common selection method for many companies, but they are not the only method. Other methods such as skills tests, reference checks, and work samples may provide a more accurate assessment of a candidate's abilities and fit for the job.

While interviews can give an initial impression of a candidate, they may not provide a complete picture of their skills, personality, and work style. Interviews may also be subject to biases, such as unconscious biases or interviewer biases, which can affect the outcome of the selection process.

Additionally, some candidates may perform well in an interview but not be a good fit for the job, while others may not perform as well in an interview but have the necessary skills and qualities for the job.

Therefore, while interviews can be a useful selection method, they should not be relied on solely to make hiring decisions. Combining interviews with other selection methods may provide a more comprehensive assessment of candidates and increase the chances of making a successful hire.",2
Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The potential increase in global media has brought a great change in the education system, where some commentators argue that it is important for teenagers to know global news as a part of their study programme. However, some analysts defend it is unnecessary and a waste of time. I strongly believe learning international current affairs help teenagers to understand what is happening in the world. This essay will explain the importance of current affairs as a part of school study programme by taking examples from recent studies. 

To begin with, bringing global current affairs as a subject in secondary school will help teenagers to be competent with current changes across the globe. The main reason for this is, studying global news at school stage will potentially inspire them to bring change in the future. The recent study from The University of Melbourne of Child Psychology, revealed that 65 % teenagers set their life goals by looking at current affairs news. Perhaps, learning global news at secondary school level will help them to know what to do in future. 

Secondly, secondary school is the perfect age for the teenager to get inspired. However, there are some drawbacks by bringing global current affairs as part of study programme. Firstly, teenagers will attract to negative news very easily than positive. Moreover, due to lack of maturity, they might take wrong decisions. The recent study of Child's Crime, Psychology shows that, teenagers are the most vulnerable group to attract for crime. As a result, adding global news in school study programme is not a good idea. 

Considering all this, I firmly believe that global news in secondary school as a subject will potentially benefit the teenager to understand what they want in the future.",3
Many people think that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Generally,office interviews are the best part to analyse the aspirant and learn about him.However,there are some people who don't approve of the following idea and believe that there are other factors that can help employees assess whether the contender can be hired or not for the particular position.I suppose,there are other several ways to know better about a aspirant, including the interview as well.  

On the one hand, as it is vividly seen for all of us , job interviews play a key role in hiring any employee. Because the majority of the interviewers can know a lot about an applicant on the first day of their meeting. The first day leaves a great impression ( whether it is positive or negative) on both sides. For example, if an interviewee is late for an interview we can conclude that this employee is not quite responsible and won't show satisfactory results later as well. Moreover, during the ,interview an interviewer carefully checks all the details and small items of a person and can tell many things about him/her.

On the other hand, according to another group of ,people there are some other ways that can help us judge an employee. Many bosses usually use a wide variety of methods and one of them is, giving a worker tougher pressure. They tend to pressurise their employees by ordering them multiple tasks and by this they find whether they can get rid of that moment wisely or not. Additionally, observations during  work time can also be handy in cases where we should decide on a applicant whether he is suitable in a labour market or not. 

Our discussions above show that, there are certain factors excluding interviews that can help us find out better about an applicant in a profession market.",3
some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Many believed artificially intelligent robots will soon take over most jobs from human beings. While the robots’ ability might fit well for most repetitive jobs, it is difficult to replace jobs that require human creativity with the A.I. This essay will discuss why our creativity at work is difficult for AI to imitate in certain occupations.

For duties requiring a same standard, the artificial robots might be better candidates than the humans. Robots can be programmed to execute repetitive motions which make them a perfect task force of production to meet strict quality controls. For instance, in Japanese catering industry, most procedures in fast food production are operated by the machines, thus the taste and outlook of each frozen meals are all identical. Therefore, it is foreseeable that many of the similar tasks could be delivered by robots instead.

In contrast, jobs that involve human creation might be difficult for machines to perform. Human’s ability in perceiving and expressing news ideas are unique; it cannot be duplicated by programming. Great authors touched hearts of millions by observing the humanity and deliver in a story; artists communicate with their audience by paintings or sculptures and the emotion resonates with our hearts. Even if we programme robots with the most versatile vocabularies or the best art-crafting techniques, robots could not produce masterpieces like “Crime and Punishment” or “Starry Night”. That is the reason why in some aspects machines could never win over human beings.  

To conclude, robots are expected to become dominant in jobs in specific areas. Robots are highly qualified for repetitive labouring; whereas jobs that require imagination might not be at robots’ expertise. Ultimately, few occupations might still be safe from robots’ seizure comparing to the major robot employment in the future.",8
"In some cities, people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. Why is this case? Which development do you think is better?","In modern society, crime rate has been rapidly change compared to the earlier decades. This essay will explore which are the reasons influenced by the main problem and express my view in the end.  

First of all, in different parts of the world, people prefer to use  bicycles rather than cars. It has a number of benefits, such as it will help to enhance their energetic level. In modern society,  half of the public suffering from obesity, heart diseases, high blood pleasure…etc. If you using bikes you could reduce illness and increased the level of energy and boosting the immunity system. Moreover, people could use the bike-sharing scheme and it would be more affordable price compared to  cars. In recent years, CO2 emissions have also high and  environmental pollution has been increased as much more.Cycling is more popular in different parts of the globe and it will help to decreased pollution and traffic level in the urban area.

On the other hand, some people prefer to choose cars. Because it has a number of advantages rather than drawbacks, such as being faster, comfortable and more convenient. In modern society, we can use driverless or electric vehicles as well. Technology has changed our daily routine. Many people have to work on  busy schedules. If you have a car you could use your vehicle to going the workplace, the market, university and it would help to save your valuable time. However, it would be very easy rather than raiding a bike.

Finally, from my point of view, according to  modern ,society people need to get cars to fulfilling their basic requirements. I would agree with that second statement. Because comparing with earlier decades people mind has been changed.",8
Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of population who are aged 15 and younger. What is your opinion of the current and future effects it may have in those countries ?,"The young age population have an important impact on  society, so some nations have the policy to increase that population number. From my perspective, those countries have to experience  significant growth in jobs related to this age group and in the future, the impact of elderly illness will be reduced. This essay will discuss the current and forthcoming impacts in more detail.

In the current time, as the figure of youngest age group increased the jobs related to this population increased as well. This is because  there is a huge demand for many services to serve this group. For example, when there were more than 15 million children in Egypt in the 1980s, the figure of teachers either in schools or kindergarten was increased by 50% according to the Egyptian government. Without an increase in the number of teachers, there were children with no education chance. Therefore, many jobs have been created as a consequence of the ever-increasing proportion of  people aged  15 or younger. 

In the future, as more population who are younger than 15 years, the impact of elderly diseases will be eliminated. Because, the elderly people proportion will the smallest. In Nigeria, for instance, there is a study that expects the rate of back diseases will be less than 10% in 2030 according to a London university study. Without this trend, the reduction in the rate of older people illness will be not possible. Therefore, in the next years, there will be a reduction in the rate of elderly age group diseases as a result of increasing young people proportion. 

In conclusion, some countries have to ever increase the youngest group portion. I believe this trend has to raise the number of professions related to this group and in the  future is expected to reduce the level of elderly illness.",9
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially inetligent robots.


What is your opinion?","The recent development of technology has threatened certain types of occupations. Hence, some claim that in the near future almost all jobs will be invaded by these machines. In my opinion, of course robots will play a significant role in the future, but they will not take over the whole job market.

To begin with, each an every machine or robot has been designed and developed by human minds. Yes, it is true that these artificial creatures can do a lot of things. But, someone needs to program with correct instructions in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decisions because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence. Moreover, these devices should be designed by someone, always those tasks are done by human beings. For instance, a robot can instruct to repair a car, yet it could not instruct to design a car. Because that needs a higher level of intelligence. Another common fact is that robots cannot process empathy. As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors who need social skills.

Nonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour works do not need much of brain power. Those work only needs to repeat some actions. Hence, those types of work will be done by robots in the future. As a result, people should move away from work that only needs physical strength and learn the work require metal skills. 

To sum up, although some jobs are taken over by robots, these electronic and mechanical devices will not be able to take over the occupations that need empathy and higher intelligence levels.",5
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In this modern world, there is a new tendency to have children in the family  later. While some believe that this contention has more benefits than demerits, others have different beliefs. This essay will discuss  both advantages and disadvantages and which of both has more outweigh.

Having infants at older age depend on the couple's decision. Most of the time, individuals  tend to have a successful career in their early stages of life, and then at ,later they can afford a financially stable life for their children. In order to give a quality life to their successors, it is important to have a stress-free family background. When couples become mature over  time, it is rare to have family break-ups and inter-family conflicts. One of the latest research revealed, that, in the USA, Couples who work in the IT industry tend to have their children when they are around 35-40 years old. That report clearly shows that  with all the considerable data those parents are the best to raise  healthy and well-mannered offspring.

Although the aforementioned positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, with  time, both men and women have genetic degradation which can directly have an impact on a child's genetic defects such as Down's Syndrome and Autism. Although, these elders  lack the strength to play with their youngsters, as they have more energy compared to their parents. As an example, if parents are in their 60s, it is difficult to work and understand infants who are in their 20s. The generation gap is the most dangerous factor that can destroy the bond of a family.

In sum, given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of having children at older ages, it is reasonable to conclude that, it is more beneficial to conceive offspring at an early stage of life.",7
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"There is no doubt that online education has become a new learning trend. However, while I agree that they also have negative aspects, still I believe that this advanced technology is mainly beneficial to  individuals. In this essay, I will  support my view with examples.

 During the coronavirus pandemic, offline schooling became more challenging. The universities had to start web-based classes, in order to stop coronavirus from affecting the younger generation's health. In initial studies, it was declared that this virus is more dangerous to the youth. In such a situation, it was difficult to continue the academic system without wasting kids studies and maintaining their health. At that time, virtual tuitions were only the possible option that can save school learner's years and well-being simultaneously. due to this solution, the youngsters can connect with their teachers and faculty. They can learn new concepts and clear their doubts. Moreover, they can even conduct digital examinations.

Another major advantage of attending  such courses is that it saves time. Nowadays, time plays a crucial role in our life. If a working person wants to pursue a specific program then it may become difficult for him to make a balance between his job and exams, as he also needs to travel to his university to attend the classes. As a consequence, it becomes hard to concentrate on both the tasks and he may lose his focus and leads to mental pressure. While applying for such alternatives, it can save his travelling time and he can also utilize his travelling  time in learning. In recent years, there are many applications are available in the market and with their ,help you can select your stream. One such example is the Upgrade application. 

In conclusion, despite there are few reasons why we should value offline education, I'm inclined to consider that the pros of online education outnumber the cons.",8
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while other thing it is a waste of time discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Art is an important culture in the world. Art promotes an understanding and appreciation of the uniqueness of our different cultures, stories, experiences and personal perspectives. This is the focus of debate, and there are two reasons  it behind. The first reason is that children think art is a most important subject . The second is that children are affected by their impeded learning. In this essay, the possible reasons behind and measures of my views on the following points.

The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that people think art is basically subject for kids in school.In  art education, while children are growing up  art is shouldn't without in their life. Art provides people with an enhanced awareness of our diverse culture in the world. By contrast, destroying the children's time is the other problem. It would be a busy learning environment in Hong Kong. Toughen schedules, and massive homework both torture  children every day.

However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off if don’t take the subject of art in the children's school life. Children may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an art academic environment. In the fact, they are only learning  the main subjects like Chinese, English, and Maths. Children can not establish their self-esteem and raise  their confidence in different fields of the subject. But overall, I think this is less likely today, most of the schools involve the subject of art, and organise a campaign of competition of art, it is overweighed to nothing. 

My view is that children should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Children with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated to pay attention to art , which is the best way to gain a deeper diverse vision of themselves.",5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The importance of art in the school curriculum is a polarizing issue. While some people believe that studying art is a waste of time, others think it helps children enhance important skills. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and then I will give my own opinion.

On the one hand, there are reasons why schools should not place great emphasis on art. The first reason is that this subject offers limited future employment prospects. In other words, a career in art is often unstable and short-lived compared to non-art professions. Another reason is that not many students are artistically gifted, which is a prerequisite for a successful career. Forcing such students to study art would only take time away from other subjects and thus affect their overall performance at school.

On the other hand, art offers great benefits to schoolchildren. Firstly, it enhances their creativity. In art classes, learners are encouraged to think creatively. For example, they can learn how to blend colours available to them to create different hues for their paintings. As creativity is crucial in many fields, learning art is likely to be beneficial to young learners in their later life, especially in their future career. Secondly, their fine motor skills are also honed. In other words, drawing or painting requires dexterity and hand-eye coordination. In fact, many studies have shown that these skills will later translate into better academic outcomes for children in other subjects including writing, literacy, mathematics, and science.

In conclusion, judging from the benefits it offers, I completely agree that art plays an essential role in children’s development and therefore should not be removed from the school curriculum.",8
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Because eating healthy food is very good for our health,there are many vitamins,minerals and nutrients in it. It is supplying all of the nutrients for our body. Besides that, it is very good for the teen people because they are in the development process if they eat healthy food every day,they never have pimples and short,they will be taller and stronger. Especialy smarter.

      We can make some leaflets and designs some advice like “You should eat healthy food and do exercise regularly”on  paper and stick it in the wall or give it to your friends or strangers to give them a piece of advice.

   Besides that,  exercise regularly helps us train our speed and helps our bones solid. We can get up early and do some exercise such as running,walking or cycling for 30 to 60 minutes every day.

 In sum, eating healthy food and doing exercise is an important things that we should  realize in our life.",0
"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this has set a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner are globally known for living a lavish lifestyle rather than known for their works. Many agree that they have set unrealistic standards of happiness and success for young people. However, this essay will disagree with this view because many celebrities are also known for their professional and charity works. Besides that, many stars are also well known for using their fame for raising awareness about some of our planet’s most pressing issues.   

Despite a small number of celebrities presenting unhealthy behaviours and materialism on national TV shows, many inspirational celebrities have achieved the pinnacle of their careers and inspired the young in the process. For example, one of the Oscar-winning actors, Tom Hanks, is well known for his achievements in acting. His works have inspired many aspiring young actors to make a breakthrough in their acting careers.  Furthermore, many Grammy Award winners are more well known for their music than their fashion preferences and luxurious lifestyle. For instance, a British singer-songwriter and a Grammy Award winner, Adele, sold approximately 200,000 copies of her new album in 24 hours, showing that people passionately love her songs. 

Many stars also use their fame to raise awareness about some of our planet’s most urgent issues. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio, an Oscar-winning actor, has actively used his influence to persuade world citizens to respond to climate change. Besides donating to environmental causes, he has also urged world governments to act regarding the transition to green energy proactively. Another example is the eminent writer of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling, who has raised charity globally to help connect orphans with foster families. Her non-profit company, Lumos, has helped thousands of orphans worldwide find loving foster families.

In conclusion, TV and movie stars mostly use their fame wisely to influence their fans. They have become excellent role models and advocates of urgent issues our world is facing.",5
"Some people believe that violence on television and in computer games has a damaging effect on society. Others deny that these have any significant influence on people's behaviour.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","These days, the proliferation of the media industry, including video games and television, and its violent-related content have sparked heated debates. While some critics argue that violent content has negative impacts on the community, others disagree with such a notion. This essay will examine both sides of the discussion and provide a conclusion.

Advocates of this idea argue that exposure to violence through television and video games has the detrimental effect of desensitizing young people to violence. For example, they may adopt aggressive and violent behaviours from the shows they watch or the games they play and consider them a normal part of life. As a result, this can lead to an increase in the rate of domestic violence and violent crimes, such as armed robbery and homicide.

Nevertheless, others argue that the impact media violence has had on people’s behaviour is insignificant. This is because shows and video games only serve as means of entertainment. Thus, it is common sense that game players and TV audiences are aware that any activity shown is for demonstration purposes only and would have minimal impact on how they behave. If scenes on television could have had such great impacts, other programs with educational values such as science, history, and astronomy must have had the same effect on society. In fact, the number of people who work as scientists, archaeologists, and astronomers is still relatively small compared to other professions.

In my opinion, even though media consumers can distinguish between real and virtual at a certain level, excessive exposure to violent behaviours may affect their judgment and desensitize them to violence. This is because, in order to attract more viewers, show producers often make violence as realistic as possible and include as much of this element as possible. Consequently, people may be more likely to watch these shows and engage in these games instead of other types of available programs on TV, which increases their exposure to violence in the media.

In conclusion, although violent scenes presented in the media are for entertainment purposes only and viewers are aware of this, I contend that its overabundant consumption may obscure the ability to distinguish and normalize violence for the young, which may have negative consequences for society.",9
"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that earning while studying has many advantages. There are some people support acquiring a job as long with education, others oppose this due to some reasons. In my opinion, I strongly believe in former view because it has some merits.

On the one side of the argument, it is sometimes thought students would focus only their academics instead of  getting a part- time work. This is because engaging in the other activities might result in poor performance in the examinations. Consequently, these learners would suffer a lot as they could not show an excellent educational background in their adulthood and employability would slim. For instance, in India, rarely, children have been allowed to work by both their parents as well as the teachers.

On the other hand, nevertheless, opponents of the above mentioned argument point that joining as a trainee in some work would give a better job prospects when they become adult. In other word, having an hand on experience in the field of preferrence, could give a chance to successful. For example, nursing students often work as a care giver during their student period. This not only assist to earn money, but also job related skills. Therefore, I, firmly think that joining a small work along with studies is highly essential for the futuristic employees.

In conclusion, even though people have different opinion on whether to have  a job along with studies. In my viewpoint,  I think it is a great idea to get a work as well as education.",8
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"By the present, there have been many concerns about the environment negatively affected to by human activities, and one of them is the consumer goods manufacturing. It is essential to argue how this manufacturing has negative impact to the environment and what should be done to restrict this impact. 

To begin with, consumer goods companies are responsible for the pollution. They try their best to reduce expenses to maximize profits. Because dealing with production waste is extravagant for many companies, they decide to skip this activity and emit them into the environment. There are many consequences of this decision to the environment. The majority of companies use fossil fuels as the main energy source and several toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide are emitted into the air. Because of them, air quality can decrease, impacting to photosynthesis of plants and respiration of animals. In addition, many studies indicate that the three aforementioned gases are the main cause of greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming and climate change. Another concerning consequence is the gases can result in acid rain, destroying many species in nature. As regard to water, it can be affected by liquid waste from factories, including wastewater, sludge, oil and grease. Water species can die due to these pollutants or have to migrate to other habitats. To reduce these consequences, government should impose taxation on contaminating activities of companies and taxes should be as high as possible. By this way, factories have to consider whether not dealing with waste is still beneficial for them. If companies keep this behavior, they can face strict tax punishments, which can make their products exorbitant and affect to their profit.

However, companies are not the only factor of environmental problems. Consumers are also the accomplice in the matter. Nowadays, there is a tendency among them that they use disposable goods instead of durable goods. For instance, customers are more likely to use plastic-wrapped paper cups, not conventional plastic, glass or porcelain mugs just because they want to use once only and then throw into trash bins. The trend is also apparent in using plates, people prefer the plastic-wrapped paper, not the typical plastic or the porcelain. Consequently, landfills will have to receive a great amount of garbage of disposable goods. The problem is the majority of these goods are made of materials which are usually difficult to decompose in short periods and toxic when incinerated. Therefore, people are likely to keep garbage in landfills. It is certain that land can get contaminated due to the consumption behavior of modern society. To restrict land pollution, government should impose taxes on disposable goods. Due to taxation, these goods’ costs increase and consumers are more likely to restrict using them. By this solution, the amount of waste from disposable goods can decline. 

In conclusion, the production of consumer goods impacts to the natural environment through companies, by waste, and customers, by using disposable goods. To reduce these negative effects, governments should impose taxes on waste and disposable goods. Due to taxation, companies and consumers have to think again about the possible benefits and losses they have, indirectly reducing their influence on the environment.",5
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn and, should not have to pay tax to the state.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Money is the main source of happiness for human being. Many people considered that after so many hard work they have earned money so they want to keep that money. Although as an aware citizen, we should keep mind to provide fair tax to our government to ensure our public services. In my opinion, I believe that every citizen should pay fair taxes. 
         Firstly, Money is everything for today’s world. This is because we can buy our necessary products from money. Without money, we couldn’t ensure our future livelihood. So people make sure that they have enough money to survive. In addition, many people think that the more they can invest the more they can accumulate in the long run. As a result, they are unwilling to lose money through the deduction of tax.
       In contrast, an aware citizen should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for number of reasons. If we pay taxes in time, we can get good highway roads, hospital facilities, parks and many other public services. With the same money, people can help to ensure the economy of country. For instance, paying the tax is a way of ensuring the comfortable livelihood. 
          In conclusion, many people think that money is useful for life and they should not pay taxes. Therefore, people should avoid pay taxes as it may affect the country’s economy and public services.",1
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers.

Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Some people reckon that it is an extravagant waste of time to beef knowledge up, instead of this they would rather boost interior confidence and quarrel with their mentors. While their contestants suppose it would be a reduction of respect and submission among students. I believe that  teachers must not diminish the quality of education, but solidifying and inspiring also should be intruded into the educational system

To start, preachers don't have the right to keep information from students , they have to teach them knowledge as well. For example, if the child is confident but not clever enough he or she will  never pass entrance exams or make further decisions. Secondly, another reason is self-esteem does not give them superb predicaments to broaden their horizon of knowledge. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that studying sometimes might be  monotonous pupils are not eligible to cease doing hard work in order to create their desirous luxurious life in the future.

To reflect the fact that a lack of self-confidence combined with an impeccable brain might not satisfy the competent's demands of an employer or in  life as a whole. For example, the learner who hesitates would  rather not show their capabilities fully and properly. Firstly, loss of certainty in humans might turn them into grey mice who are scared to endeavour new things and steps. Secondly, individuals who don't dread  something and had a great formation at  school time could transcend all barriers. Finally, in general,durability unified with the ability to exhibit in front of the public or outpour feelings will lead to unbelievable results

In conclusion, mentors should not only teach unity but also make them  certain in expressing ideas",8
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion? 
Give reasons for your answer.","Artificially intelligent robots are steadily taking off the positions of individuals at their place of work. Even though, there is every tendency for most simple positions to be taken over in the future, it is most unlikely that occupations that deal with human beings to be completely taken over . This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be done by people and not replaced by robots .

In future , computerized devices will substitute all menial jobs that are unskilled in nature. Most employers will shift more towards the use of artificial intelligence because it is cost-effective compared to employing humans. For example , in Nigeria, accounting software is now being used for auditing and balancing accounts in various finance firms replacing the jobs of some financial analysts and auditors. In addition, this software work around the clock and requires no remunerations, performing better, faster and efficiently. For these reasons, machines will substitute posts that requires fewer human skills.

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. These jobs include psychiatrists, software developers, project managers and graphic designers, to name but a few. Computerized devices will never be able to replace some jobs because certain human beings are needed to perform those tasks.

In summary, computers and machines will most likely , in the long run gradually take up a significant number of activities. The menial professions will eventually be controlled by robots,  nevertheless, work that requires highly intelligent human skills will still be available. Ultimately, in a progressively automated workplace, limited human jobs will be safe.",5
Some people believe that eventually all the jobs will be done by artificial intelligence robots. What is your opinion?,"Artificial intelligence will take over most of the job opportunities in the future. Although effort that involves minor human interaction might take over by robots,  there will be certainly a workforce needed to fulfil a profession that requires maintaining human relationships. This essay will dictate pointers to support why the human workforce cannot be completely replaced through machinery.

Robots may eventually replace businesses where a human brain is not needed o fulfil necessary tasks. Many companies will choose to invest in artificial intelligence which instead is a cheaper resource as compared to hiring an individual. For instance, a lot of companies in Canada are switching to driverless trucks which are taking away effort opportunities from truck drivers. For these reasons, a lot of labour would be accomplished with the help of machines instead of people.

Conversely, there are jobs that cannot be replaced because bots will never achieve the capability to accomplish them. There are plenty of jobs that would always require  human assistance. To cite an example, fields such as Medicine, Psychology, Education, and social work are impossible for machineries to attain  because there will be always a need to have a human touch while implementing those tasks.

In conclusion, a significant number of assignments will be conducted by artificial intellect in the future. However, a plethora of skills, as well as emotions are not inherited in the artificial intelligence to perform tasks that require major contributions by humans. Ultimately, in ,future there will be a balance between the work achieved with the help of individuals and robots.",8

in some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. what are the reasons for this? how can people research this?,"Nowadays, it is observed that there is an upward trend among the societies in some different areas in the world that they want to realize the story behind their houses. In this essay , I will consider why this is happening and also explores some possible ways to research it.

the main reason for this trend could be that , people really keen on finding the identity of their home. What I mean by this is that  some people especially younger people prefer to know the value of their home from a historical aspect. For example, in Iran, the majority of houses particularly the old buildings, have a history  them behind. As a result, people know the historical value of their house and try to preserve it. Another reason is when you find out about your possession's value, you will try to keep it as a valuable asset. For instance, in some countries, people buy valuable houses which have a story and it could be a fine example of a good investment. Consequently, most   people tend to know the history of their home.

There are some possible solutions to find about the past of a house. For one, people could go to 

municipality of their town as the history of every single house is kept there. For another , most of the community in some cities, especially the small cities, know about the background of the houses. It can  lead to an acceptable result for the owners of these homes. Subsequently, people can use these methods and get some ideas about their houses. 

In conclusion, to reiterate there are some reasons for searching the history of some buildings which are the preservation and the financial investment. However, people can use some methods which are asking the people and municipality for more information. Should people consider these ways, they could find more impressive information.",7
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Metropoles has been suffering from  traffic for a long time. Despite the known causes, the number of  precautions taken is not sufficient.  

Unlike the past,  numerous vehicles are producing in order to ensure  public transportation and carrying goods. To begin with, the needs of trucks surged due to provide unlimited human desires such as foods, raw materials, finished industrial materials, technological devices, and clothes. For example, the population of the world was low in contrast to the now, therefore more foods and products were produced in the past. In this context, there are fewer vehicles were needed to use. However, the type of the products are variated, and more goods are manufactured, and a huge amount of the plants is cultivated, hence the vessels are needed more than before.  Secondly, the population of the urban were raised because of the movement from rural areas. Consequently, the number of cars, busses and trains went up to carry the people between the places.

Significantly,  overusing vessels can cause myriad problems like air pollution, contamination of water resources, and the quality of foods. The published researches indicate that the main reason for  pollution is the producing greenhouse gases and the crucial source of the gases are using petroleum and its derivatives. Particularly, the trucks use petroleum products, produce more gases, and have severe effects on the environment.

Even if the precautions are more costly to eliminate the causes, it is easy to implement. First, the time of the engine can be reduced. For instance, the engines can be stopped out of working times. Second, environmentally friendly trucks can be manufactured like hybrid cars. Finally, the emigration from rural areas to the cities can be minimized.

İn conclusion, the overusing of vessels have the ability to damage the environment. İf the communities desire to decline negative effects, they should take precautions.",10

On one hand, in this modern era a lot of things are getting developed similarly there are shops and products are opening their branches in different countries which is good sign because the market is blooming  on top of this a large variety of products are being available to a lot more population. The shops used to specific to few countries only and all the products were not available in all places. People started using online platform to reach their needs, where a lot of people got swayed by different fake websites. In addition ended up buying fake products as well. For example, when I was on a trip to London I pampered myself with some skin care goodies and I absolutely loved using them, however when I wanted to refill my products I couldn’t find them anywhere in India. So I tried finding them online, I was completely elated and ordered them but ended up getting the fake ones. So problems like this can be solved and it would be more convenient to the population across the world.

On the other hand, to open shops in different countries a lot of deforestation is happening and the land is conquered by the industrialists in order to construct buildings. The environment is getting spoiled leading to lot of consequences. For example, I purchased a villa because it had a beautiful view of the tress right next to my house and also for proper ventilation. In few months all the tress were cut off and a shopping mall was constructed. 

To conclude, According to me it is a positive development because to reach the needs of the growing population it is better to have many branches in various different countries as it would be accessible to residents in variety of  locations.",5
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.


To extent what extent to you agree?","In the current generation, people have the luxury to send their kids to  single-sex and  co-educational schools. while the majority of the people consider educating their children in a co-educational school as it possesses  great benefits. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view.

Firstly, the institute is supposed to be the microcosm of children's education, where they can interact with their peers, seniors and juniors which will guide them to evolve  with people from socio-cultural and other backgrounds. Needless to say, the years spent in university play a crucial role in shaping their life. Juneviles educated in  mixed-gender schools are confident and comfortable in the company of members of the opposite sex.

On the other hand, in  single-sex schools, youngsters can interact only with  kids  of the same sex. Which has  negative implications considering the children's future. For instance, youngsters who are educated in  single-sex institutions will be diffident when it comes to interacting with the company of members of the opposite gender. In addition to that, when it comes to working in an organisation they will find it more challenging which will make them  feel like an introvert and  can interrupt their career growth.

To conclude, single-sex school affects the confidence of students interacting with their opposite sex, however, by considering the current work trend, where the men and women associate equally in the workplace  to compete, co-operate and collaborate with each other, hence the co-educational academy are valued more and better for them by considering the future",8

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","In  recent years, the number of vehicles on the road has climbed up considerably. This has immediately been an issue for many countries. This problem has its sources as well as ideas to remedy it.

To begin with, a significant percentage of the population around the world have their own vehicle. Each family has at least one or two cars. These people benefit from it as a mode of transport to commute to their destinations such as workplace, shopping mall or at their relative's place. Few of them would go by bus or take the metro. They find it easier and more comfortable to travel in their own car. On the other hand, companies that offer delivery services usually use countless goods vehicles. This ultimately leads to traffic congestion on the roadway. Now, in some countries,  road development is quite poor. The street is sometimes narrow or has cracks. Consequently, this also contributes to a high rate of traffic.

One measure that can be taken is to sensitize the car owners. They should be encouraged to travel by bus rather than using the car more often. The government could take initiatives like lowering the bus fare or increasing the frequency of buses on the road. A sustainable idea could be offering each family a bicycle motivating them to consider other means of transport. Also, they should try to solve this issue by implementing and building highways with more lanes as well as using more durable materials to construct the roads. Last but not least, companies need to find a way to change the working shifts for their employees. Thereby, decreasing the density of workers and the number of vehicles.

To conclude, traffic jams can only be eradicated if the causes are taken into considerations. The government could play a huge role in resolving this problem.",8
The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions,"It is true that technologies have become in popularity and they have swirled a controversy in wealth gap. While a number of people believe that the development of digital era rise the disparity between upper and lower class, I would argue that it can be the opposite trend.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why some considers there is an enormous discrepancy in these classes because of technology growth. Firstly, the most modern technologies are frequently invented for upper class. Going abreast of high quality, the price of these high-tech innovations seems only reaches the rich, which is over effort of the poor. Luxurious cars namely Maybach or Ferrari might support this idea. Furthermore, in term of medical sector, although the medical facilities and treatments are innovated to prescribe for patients, the expenses are incredible increasing so that solely the prosperous can be affordable. For example, in Corona virus pandemic, most of the impoverished suffered from pain and passed away owing to the lack of breathing supported equipment. 
On the other hand, I believe that technologies enhance a beneficial effect on narrowing discrepancy between the wealthy and deprived people. Technologies and the Internet is beginning viral to all social classes and it is likely for the lower class to become rich now. A lot of Vietnamese farmers namely Mrs Tan Vlog and Mr Ba Vlog can earn a tremendous amount of money from their cooking videos which are popular in the Internet. Plus, thanks to the spread of wireless, people regardless background can be able to access international knowledge from their smart gadgets, which is totally different compared to the past. From all these ideas, it is clear that the technologies’ advancement will lead to greater equality. 
In conclusion, although both views have certainly have some validity, I it seems to me that the gap between well off people and who live in poverty will be decreased with the development of technologies.",3
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In today's time, human activities are having an extreme effect on climate change of our planet and some people think that rather than taking measure's to prevent humidity change, we should learn to live with it. I firmly disagree with this opinion, and in this essay, I will provide a certain example's to back my argument.

These days, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at there highest levels since the past thousand's of years. This has caused many problems. For instance, people who live in polluted cities have difficulty in breathing, low fertility rate, lower life expectancy among infants and much more. All this combined with global warming and man-made pollution has made it extremely difficult for nature to maintain it's rest configuration. All this has caused drastic changes to occur in our planet's climate, which can also cause many natural habitats to go extinct. Under such circumstances, only us humans will be able to adapt to the temperature changes, but not other species.

For example, consider the case of fishes. The continuous increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the vapourisation of polar ice caps. This has lead to an increase in  sea levels around the world. In such circumstances, the amount of human waste deposition into the sea and oceans around the world has also increased which has led to the deaths of countless fishes in these waters. Moreover, in some instances, these fishes were found to be dead on the shore of beaches and some found to be floating dead on the surface of the water. This is just one of the few examples that go on to show, that although humans will be able to adapt to all the temperature changes and find a way to live with these changes, majority of the animal kingdom population won't be able to do the same.

So in a nutshell, instead of finding a way to live with the changing temperature, one should look for ways to minimize it. By doing so, we won't only be saving our own natural habitat, but we will also be creating a more stable and livable environment for the future generation's to come.",10
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Concentrating on lessons is one of the most common problems for a lot of pupils at schools. There are some reasons  why is this happening and also the solutions for them which will be discussed in this essay. 

  The first reason for the absence of concentration are subjects that are taught in a monotonous way. In such case, kids get distracted by other things they bring to school from home. For instance, in our era of technology, even elementary school students have a phone or tablet where there are numerous apps and games. As a result, a child pulls the phone out of his pocket as soon as the lesson gets boring. The solution is for the teacher to engage students in different interactives to better grasp the topics. This method will decrease children’s interest in participating in discussion and hols their attention. 

  Another reason is a teacher’s approach to everyone. Situations, when no attention is paid to some students, occur frequently and as a result, a kid starts doing anything but not listening to the pedagogue. However, if some kids can tell their parents about that type of accident, there are some who does not. Moreover, somebody can even believe it is normal behaviour for a teacher. For instance, some teachers can offend students because they do not meet the standards they imagine in their heads. To tackle this issue, the entire teaching staff ought to attend psychologist sessions before starting to work with children. 

  In conclusion, both problems can be solved if the efforts are made, especially when a person likes the job and is ready to do anything to involve pupils in the process of education.",8
"some think most crime is the result of circumstances, e.g., poverty and other social problems. Others believe that most crime is caused by people who are bad by nature. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Receiving, the topic of criminal sense is the product of being treated in  abysmal conditions, while others think that unacceptable behaviours create crime. From the prior experience, this writer argues that social factors affect human beings due to careless childhood.

It is vital to understand that human nature can be adversely affected during growing age. Take an example of once people around a child did some pulling actions, which can be noticed by the young and the would likely act in the same way to the others. This leads to the standard of bad habits and they can even cause some potential risks of being a murderer at an early age. Hence, parents should put their children in a safe zone in order to prevent some miserable things around them.

As this point may be true, yet, once criminals acted, they knew what they were doing was wrong, but their habits made them think  what they did was for the right purposes. This is because crime's behaviours are not being punished ever since they have made a few mistakes. Not far from the fact that people will do anything to protect their best things even though they have to break the law. Thus, it can not be given to the crime is created by their nature.

It is this writer's opinion that people need well-education, which concludes mental health. It can be self-evident that the community is responsible for the youngster's behaviour, let the children walk in the right path. Therefore, people, especially children should not  lack  attention.

Taking all points into account, society's actions can lead a potential criminal as well  humans ought to remember what they have done and defend the roots of crime once it happens.",2
"Some people believe that watching TV is bad for children, while others claim it has positive effects for children as they grow up. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While it is widely claimed that watching TV is beneficial for children when they become adults, some argue that TV is bad for offspring. Both points of view and the reason why I believe that TV has more positive effects than negative will be elaborated on this essay.

To begin with, it might seem sensible for some to believe that TV consumption is bad for children. This is possibly because there is some inappropriate content on TV, for instance, in action films, there is violent behaviour such as fighting, shooting, or robbing, and kids who consume that content can imitate those which is not good for society at large.

On the other hand, opponents of this idea might propose that there are positive effects on TV. To put in other words, educational programs on TV can supply learning materials for children, for example, they can learn English through English language cartoons, certain shows can enhance creativity and imagination, and exposure to different cultures.

Personally, I would argue in favour of positive effects, because when I was young, I learned the English language via cartoons on a cartoon network channel, and this is a fun way to learn, unlike learning at school. In school, kids might find that learning new languages is hard because some teachers teach their students in a stressful way. 

In conclusion, althought it is undeniable that kids should not watch TV, I am of the opinion that watching TV has more positive than negative effects for a children.",4
"Some People believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots
what is your opinion?","Artificially intelligent robots rather than people will do all of the jobs. While it is possible that artificial robots will perform all types of jobs except robotic technology.  Hence this essay will discuss why particularly all of the jobs will undertake robots than human beings.
In these days, many jobs are undertaken by artificially intelligent robotic machines.  Cumbersome repetitive tasks are difficult for any people, therefore it is better to get it done by robotic machines. For example, all of the work in manufacturing foundries is done by robotic arms without any rest, which lead to maximum profit at large scale in a short span of time. For these reasons, robots will eventually replace almost jobs performed by humans in the upcoming future.
Conversely, artificial robotic machines cannot replace few jobs unless they learn that as well. Human beings only know progressing in robotic technology, which outnumbers the artificial robots. For example, developing new algorithms for making artificial intelligent robots, which shall be developed by expert human beings. Because of that major reason, it is in believing, that artificial robots due to their limited functional capacities will not do those jobs that require human knowledge.
Some people believe that artificially intelligent robotic machine will perform all of the jobs except those, which require complex level knowledge.  All of the repetitive work may be handled by the robots, however, the people will do where the complex development is necessary.  In my opinion, I believe that the robotic machines will perform all of the laborious jobs while the expert skilled peoples will do other jobs that require cognitive thinking ability.",6
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that it would be preferable to create a solution in order to adapt to climate change. As well as, individuals have to stop investigating how to ban it. Nevertheless, I completely feel vice versa with the aforementioned. Due to the fact that both humans and the environment will be damaged. The reasons why people should prevent temperature change will be highlighted in the following lines.

 

To commence with, the supporters of the prior viewpoint assume that climate change and humans cannot live together due to they might be harmful. To contribute more, the increase in temperature will result negatively on citizens' health. Therefore, hospitals might be full of sick patients. Accordingly, the rate of death people rises. As an illustration, it was noticed this year developing of temperature degree in various countries. Consequently, many individuals died due to that. 

On the other hand, the holders of the previous thought argue that changes in weather would affect the environment negatively. To elaborate more, as the world gets warmer a noticeable effect might be seen in the green forces. Based on that, a decline in the proportion of O2 will be ubiquitous. Hence, the whole world will be yellow ( desert). Thus, a great number of animals will be victims. On an account of this, the rate of food will be diminished. 

To conclude, although there are individuals who support that living with climate change should be possible, it has unbelievable drawbacks for both humans and nature. According to the above-mentioned, citizens should work to reveal findings to neglect the weather changes.",3

In this essay, I will provide my point of view along with some relative examples.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What is the cause of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Society experiences a trend that the non-stop growing process of manufacturing items for users has an adverse influence on the eco-system. This essay will discuss about the main cause and a couple of solutions to tackle the issue.

On the one hand, the foremost reason that leads to a negative impact is due to an enormous amout of litter thrown away annually. The more goods are produced, the more garbage exist. It is easy to catch the moment that many tourists acquiring little education about environmental protection leave their own trash on roads and beaches. Not only people from tourisms but also local inhabitants that are not aware of collecting those garbage. Second, most of factories are utilizing unfriendly environmetally materials such as fossil fuels which may release hazardous emissions. For instance, the toxic smoke released into the atmosphere together with pollutants pumped directly to the sea can result in the air and water pollution.

However, the ways to handle this situation are varied. It is nothing but the duty of the government in protecting the ecology by setting obligatory. For example, the authorities are able to impose stricter punishment on companies that go to great lengths to produce things from bad materials such as nilon. Furthermore, local residents should also establish some environmental protection groups to launch campaigns like ‘gathering trash on a weekly basis’ and apply cutting-edge technologies to have proper packages for each product.

In conclusion, it is obvious that the reasons why the development of consumer goods does harm to the natural environment are owing to the huge wealth of litter and the toxic materials. However, there are several solutions such as enacting laws by the header and hightening people’ intellect from various green campaigns.",2
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Indeed, most people use vehicles that require fuel to work. Nowadays, increasing fuel costs wouldn't be adequate to solve environmental issues since the community would continue using primary and faster transport. In addition, other reasons are included for the ecological unbalance, such as the deforest, Agropecuario, humans, etc. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying solution.

First of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solve some of the issues. Said that, would be a good action by the factors to reduce the price of these types of vehicles. Additionally, more encouragement through some Public Policies made by the government and businesses with multimedia marketing to society starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or walk to their destinations instead of using the car. Second, a clear example that increasing fuel prices may not work is represented by the war between Russia and Ukraine, where the public continued filling their gas transport; instead, they only complained about the high costs.

Furthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products humans has been contributing to the increase in deforestation. Thus, with plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farm animals, like cows, goats, pigs, and chickens. These animals also pollute the land, rivers, and air on a large scale. On the other hand, another problem starts with the pollution everyone makes every day by not throwing the trash properly. This action impacts the whole cycle of nature and increases an environmental imbalance.

In general, changing other sectors of life, such as changes in vehicle engines and ecological reeducation, would help Mother Nature not to collapse in the future. In return for significant changes, the populations on Earth could start being healthier, and they should have more growth and a wider community.",9
Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively. Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.
Firstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.
Furthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.
On the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.
In brief, despite some short-term economic incentives, I strongly believe, as stated in the paragraphs above, that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary.",7
"Nowadays, families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, there is a growing trend of families moving to various foreign countries in search of work. Some people argue this could have negative impacts on children. However, I think moving abroad to endeavor results in their children’s exposing to foreign education systems and cultures.

From one side, a family moving abroad to job can cause some problems. First, taking children to other countries would have a negative impact on child psychology. To illustrate this, kids could take a long time to integrate into a new environment and culture, since they have to leave their close friends and family members contributing to their loneliness and homesickness. Second, learning a new language could be the biggest barrier to them. When they go to school in a foreign country, they could not be able to keep up with academic and linguistic ability of their new classmates. When their ability to acquire knowledge is decreased due to the language barrier at the beginning, this would lead them to feel stressed and disappointed in themselves.

On the other hand, working overseas and taking all their children to live with could bring various benefits to them. For one thing, working abroad would offer them better working opportunity to earn money and raise their child better. As a result, their families’ living standards and monthly salary would be improved, especially for those living in undeveloped countries. Therefore, their children will have a better living condition to develop. In addition, going to another country assist their kids to have a better education system. For example, some Vietnamese people move to many developed countries, because the school curriculum will help their children to enhance their knowledge and skills completely. This leads their kids to having a better future career when they grow up.

In conclusion, an increasing number of people migrating overseas to work are increasing these days, and they mostly bring their families to these countries. In my opinion, this contributes to more benefits to their children’s future if they can overcome the difficulties at the beginning.",9

Others, however, believe this situation will cost  respect and order in the classroom . I will explain this in an essay.

On the one hand, these days online education is very developing and high school pupils  improve their educational knowledge with e-learning. On the internet ,have a lot of online courses and these sources are free and very profitable. For example, enlistment sees a variety of online lessons on the internet in order to learn more about the topics taught by the workforce at an institution and learn about  things that their force did not say and they ask about these things and this state create competition between the faculty member and student. Furthermore, positive remarks and suggestions from high seminary recruitment can help  educators to design their lessons taking into account the interests and wishes of students.

On the other hand,  some people think teenagers are not minded as humans . They can be mainly based on their emotions. And that condition existence disaster of respect. The encouragement of recruitment to criticise crew can result in a markdown of self-esteem and the fear of consequence in the team. The criticism by recruitment can be mainly based on their emotions rather than facts and logical conclusions since teenagers are not mature enough to do this.

Some people think that  art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"it is an undeniable that the arts sometimes reflects the heritage of a country. It is a controversial issue that a segment of society assert that the arts are an indispensable subject for children at school; whilst, opponents opine that it is only a waste of time. This essay Will discuss both views along with my opinion before reaching to a reasonable conclusion. 

The most prominent reason that why people considering the art as an important subject is that in this modern era only a few people are paying great attention towards the arts, the being less popular, nowadays. To elaborate, individuals are depending on the hi-tech relics, only, which are very intuitive and life become more easy. They have no knowledge about the importance of craftsmanship. The other reason is that pupils will become more creative and become artists. For instance, the art has direct relation with the economy of a nation. The Craft is very beneficial for the economic growth. As, there are various kinds of the arts and these kinds  attract people throughout the world, and because of this, the number of tourists, to a rampant increase, by this, there will be an exorbitant growth of the economy of a nation. Thus, there a plethora of positives of  the arts.

In contrast, although, the craft is paramount, yet many people think that it is a waste of time. Firstly, less concentration on study. To explain, almost every child love to the craftsmanship and children always give preference to the arts instead of other subjects such as science, technology and these are of great significant subjects, which allows students to find a good job after graduation. Next, studying the arts does not leads to a successful career. It is easy to see that those days, more artists have been struggling to make living from selling their work of the arts.

In a nutshell, after thorough analysis, on this subject, I firmly believe that the arts are very essential for a motherland and the law enforcement agencies ought to be taken some steps to preserved the craft.",5
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth

than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young

people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is am opinion that celebrities are known as for glamour and wealth are famous than achieve.While a reckon that this is a bad example for youngs,I believe that the others can occupy cool role models

 On the first hand, crucial meaning that many people do achieve without really hard working for it.Lots people ,who do not do correct hard-working,can take significant achieve by their opportunity.They may be inherited by money from parents,married to eminent partner,or they may be on gossip journals on a really TV projects.For example,Antonela Roccuzzo who is a wife of legendary football player Lionel Messi.She is rich and wife of the most famous player in the world.Antonelo goes to Messi's matches and morally support him.They have being married since 2017.The wife of football player became famous by her huslabel,but she did not exertion be herself.The allusion for young people is that success can be achieved easily,and their projects and school works are not necessary for it

On the other hand,there are as least as many examples to role models by hard working,whose accomplishments can be glorious example for young people.Musician,athletes,actors and social media stars make considerable achieve only by their really diligence.They work for more than 5-6 hours per day for their target and in the future they will get resultat of these endeavor.For example,Will Smith.He is one of the most famous people in the world.He tried to be on main roles and worked for result in the future.Nowadays,I believe that he earns millions of dollars lying at home being a celebrated and achieved actor.If the youth watch connection between trying and success,they will want to start their programmes and projects for their goal.Because,in my opinion that this type of celebrated talents can pull youth to the good side

Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead going directly to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages.,"It has been observed that the youth take a gap from their study after finishing their schooling instead of getting  admission at The University. There are several betterments and detriments to such a viewpoint. Both aspects are elaborated on further in the ensuing paragraph.

Discussing the benefits, the prime reward for travel is that the young guns can learn about the culture. By this,I mean that as student roams around the world during their break, they will learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. Therefore, they gain their approach to adapting new things into their life, and become  multilingual people. Moreover, students get  practical experience while doing part-time jobs. In other words, the pupil learns about maintaining financial condition, enhances knowledge about businesses as well as finds their choice for further study. For example, the admission department from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the students who get  admission after a gap,  results are exceptional compared to other pupils.

There is a lot of disadvantage also  ,  some students do not return back to their course . For example , they are doing a job or job they like  as it's earning  good and the work is good , they do not like to come back because they are happy with it . In addition , although they lose the chance to be experts in that field , however they do their studies then they have a degree and can make a career in a big company , now they can only do a task on a small scale .

In conclusion , however , the student can have an experience of a job , but they can not be able to expert in a particular career . Every coin has two sides , a positive and a negative , same is followed by having a gap in school and university education",7

Some believe that globalization surely benefits most countries in different aspects such as economics, education and politics; others, however, argue that it has negative consequences on national identities. In my view, globalization not only boosts economic development but generally has positive effects on national identities.
First, it is obvious that business contacts around the world contribute a lot to effective development. Entrepreneurs and business owners, from foreign countries, invest a substantial amount of money as well as technology into infrastructure and create many job opportunities for local residents, which consequently improve people's living standards. That is the reason why many countries make laws and policies to encourage international business and investment.
Moreover, with multicultural communication, national identities are more expressed to the outside world and get respected and appreciated by people from different cultures and social background. For example, water puppet has been introduced and been known in many countries recently. Therefore, Vietnamese identity has been enhanced and has impressed many people through this kind of performance which uniquely belongs to Vietnam.
Those who harbor the view that international collaboration between countries may threaten national identities may argue that youngsters start following western country trends without understanding their pros and cons. Millennials nowadays eat hamburgers, drink coffee, work in skyscrapers and even speak English often, fueling a lifestyle similar to that in New York. But I think that this just mirrors modern lifestyle and does not mean that we are losing our cultural heritage. To protect our national identities does mean that every Vietnamese people should drink tea every day and use chopsticks at every meal.
In sum, globalization do play an important role in a country's development. Meanwhile, a more prosperous economy facilitates the preservation and recognition of national cultures and identities worldwide.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Finding out the story of houses and apartments they are living in is becoming more and more trending. New generation young adults want to know their roots and backgrounds of their families through their house’s history. One of the ways is to interview elders such as their grandparents.

There are stories behind every houses, from the main entrance to the roof top balcony. If a house has been lived by more than 1 generation of a family, that place is full of histories to share. More and more people are eager to learn about their roots through the building’s histories. Many questions are waiting for answers such as when it first constructed, who is the house owner, and why this partucular design. Take my house as an example, the building I’m living in had been used as a bunker in world war two and has been renovated uncountable times, thus, this means that my ancestors survived the world war two. 

Because those are private accomodations,doing the research at national library or government website is not the best choice. The best methos is to ask people, whom have lived there for more than decades such as your grandparents or elder neighbours. By approaching experienced individuals, one can learn about histories, which mostly accurate and interesting, of the place they are living in.For instance, I learned about my ancestors through my grandmother’s stories. They escaped the povery from China and moved to Thailand 80 years ago; Hence, this house represents their success. 

To sum up, I believe that many people are curious about their roots and they can find their answers from histories behind those houses. Hence, reaching out to your elder family member for help is an efficient way to started with.",3
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement ? (approximately 250 words),"It is sometimes argued about the importance of the existence of public areas such as squares and parks in modern societies. While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.

On the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American culture’s trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Year’s Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  

On the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.

In conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",10
Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree),"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS label 8.",9
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent decades, housing scarcity in metropolitan areas has been receiving a great deal of public attention. While some assert that only government has the power to solve this problem, I disagree with this view and I believe that this issue should also be addressed by the private sector.
     On the one hand, The authority’s role in balancing demand and supply in housing is indisputable.First, since the politics has the ultimate right  in land management with the huge  resources from the national budget from tax collection, the state can build social housing at low prices coupled with the financial package for people with low income to afford their apartments with mortgage loans. Consequently, these actions are able to reduce the lack of housing in the metropolis. Second, local authorities could encourage companies to move their business to rural areas so that suburban dwellers would no longer have to commute to city centre to work, which in turn reduces urban population density.
     On the other hand, private real estate corporations are also a necessary driving force behind the supply of more housing.First, in order to decline  the lack of affordable housing, people may opt to live in other cities when the metropolis that they are working becomes crowded. For example, in recent years, a tremendously higher number of people from big cities such as Hanoi capital or Hochiminh city move to Danang city because they believe that they could get better chances to afford houses while still maintaining their living conditions. Second, if individuals only buy houses or lands for the purpose of living, asset bubbles would not happen and real estate companies would be forced to decrease property prices to survive in the market. This means that those cities would become more livable for everyone, not just the super-rich.
     In conclusion, the lack of housing is a complex problem which requires a combination of both the union and individuals  provide for the diverse needs of people. By making these solutions, housing problems in major cities will reduce considerably.",8

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own
knowledge or experience.","In some countries, there is a proliferation of people are gaining momentum in searching for the past story of the house or building they stay in. This essay will explain why and how people doing so.

To start with the first reason, people want to know about the quality and safety of their homes. For example: people will find details for the property quality, especially the construction builder, materials used to build the house and also the architecture structural in order to avoid deleterious consequences in the future such as building collapse. The second reason is to cast about the Chinese geomancy of the house location and direction. For instance, people want to live in a place that suits them and they believe that the house can give them a better fortune if it has a finer position. Last but not least, the third reason is knowing the legacy of the ownership status, so as to prevent the occurrence of unnecessary lawsuit problems.

Furthermore, there are ways that people are able to access the history of their living place. One of the common ways is browsing on the internet, this is a vital tool to explore all relevant information about the premise. Some people may be able to request from their local council or even ask the neighbours living in the neighbourhood.

Some people believe that scientists have more influence over the world whereas others argue that politician have more influence over the world. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"The debate about whether scientists or politicians  have a greater global impact is a complex one. In my opinion, I believe that both of them have significant contributions to society which can make  people’s lives better.

In this world, scientists have an important role in driving innovation and progress. Their inventions can develop and improve many aspects such as technology, health, and agriculture. For example, the invention of computers and the internet have made significant changes in the way people communicate. Decades ago, in long-distance communication through the telephone, people could not show their faces, now they could show their faces in a high-quality video even in real-time. The invention makes people’s lives easier and may improve their living quality.

On the other hand, politicians have  considerable power in making decisions that affect the entire society. This condition indicates that they have direct responsibility for the fate of each individual. One of the most significant policies which can be decided by them is fuel prices and it has domino effects in many aspects. If the fuel prices are high then it will be followed by the increase in transportation fares, food, clothes, and other basic needs prices. So, they have to be very careful and thoughtful in order to make the policies.

In conclusion, both scientists and politicians play significant roles in society, they contribute in their own way. While scientists innovate and enhance the quality of life, it is politicians who determine the implementation and impact of these innovations through policy decisions.",8
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Nowadays, many parents and teachers have found that more and more children are unable to concentrate on or focus on their studies in school. Some education experts believe that these children can face more lures in modern society such as electronic devices or gadgets, while some parents think that their sons and daughters may lose their concentration or attention because parents do not spend enough time  accompanying them. This essay will discuss the possible reasons and provide some solutions for dealing with these problems in the below paragraphs. 

On the one hand, it is generally accepted that modern society has more advanced technology and new inventions. That is to say, children who live in a modern environment may be hard to avoid using different electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones which can assist them to finish their school assignments with higher efficiency. However, these children may be addicted to electronic devices or spend too much time  surfing the internet if they do not receive enough relevant technological courses about managing their time to use the internet and electronic devices properly.

On the other hand, it can be claimed that parents have worked  more working hours in modern society. That is, the children can lose many opportunities to interact with their parents which can lead them to feel lonely and unsatisfied. Furthermore, it is believed that many parents feel exhausted after work, so they may not want to spend more time  communicating or interacting with their children. The only method that can avoid their children to bother them is to give their sons or daughters electronic devices to use, but this method may easily lead their children to become addicted to electronic devices without focusing on their studies in school.

In conclusion, it can be asserted that both parents and teachers need to arrange more extracurricular activities for their children or students to do because these activities can assist them to develop and cultivate their students' attention or concentration which can benefit them to study in school.",7
Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is an ongoing debate on whether scientific research should focus on solving global health problems, or spend the budget on other important issues. As I believe the ultimate goal of scientific research is to provide enhancements to human welfare, I think solving both world health and other issues are equally as important, and neither of which should be prioritized over the other.

On the one hand, solving world health problems is crucial to our existence as a species. In the past, there are many diseases that affects hundreds of millions of people, namely the plague or the smallpox, the latter of which has been entirely eradicated while very few people catch the plague nowadays, thanks to the extensive research into developing vaccines and preventative measures. Focusing on addressing global health issues can provide a boost to finding a cure many critical diseases, such as cancer, diabetes or malaria, which in turn can save countless lives. One prime case in point is the disease COVID-19 which has greatly disrupted everyone globally because of lockdowns, to  developing a vaccine two years later and everything is now back to normal.

On the other hand, putting an emphasis on solving world health issues can lead to neglection of other problems that are as equally as important. Regarding environmental problems, if these are not put into proper considerations, they can also pose a threat to our physical and mental well-being. If more scientific research are carried out to find solutions to pollution, global warming or loss of diversity, there could possibly be fewer people at risk of contracting diseases in the first place. Additionally, research into economic issues could help the impoverished have better shelters to stay in and enjoy a better life.

In conclusion, while health problems can pose a great threat to the human's health, other issues are not to be disregarded, as they too can greatly affect our daily lives. Governments should allocate budgets to prioritize carrying out research in an extensive field of research to ensure adequate treatment to all problems.",4
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","At the present time, a few people say that our population may have some challenges without rely  on each other, wherse other individuals believe that people are getting far self-ruling. In my opinion, living with people like a one body can be a good lifestyle for us to improve our civilization. 

For most, living independently is being a more preferable way of life. Although it create the some problems like not having an extra support from their close friends or relatives when he or she in a bad situation, they are finding some useful sides of being a self-governing humans until their current ages. For example,  numerous teenagers are doing the everything independently even the important descions without asking their parents about them. And, this can be a adequate development for those who are independently thinking about their important issues.

However, I believe that having an unity among people can be a beneficial to maintain the development of countries. If someone separated from a team, this person can do nothing, but with a team everything not seem impossible for this person because of lots of supports and arguments can make a good conclusion duration of working on a project. Thus, if we have a sense of unity among us, it may provide the some opportunities to work under lots supports in every matter. For instance, the Japanese people have some respect and always support, and most importantly they always understand when they need help to each other, therefore this country’s economic has developed as a result of having unity.

To conclude, although there are some advantages of being a independent person such as making descions independently, but I feel that having a warm relationship with every people makes the better environment and helps to improve the our economic.",4
Nowadays more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do the advantage of this trend outweigh the disadvantage?,"Having children tend to be less popular in our generation now, many people decide to have children later in their life, and many of them don't even want to have kids. There are some reasons behind it, and they will be explained in the following paragraphs.

First, the parenting costs are high. In the past, parents didn't have to spend too much time and pay too much attention to their children. However, due to the development of our society, parents want to give their kids the best life. Therefore, cultivating kids can be extremely expensive. Take China as an example. Chinese parents always pay considerably high parenting costs for kids' education, such as tutorials and home teachers. Hence, the parenting costs can be substantially high and exhausting because parents consistently need to keep an eye on their children. 

Second, the matured welfare system. In the past, especially during wartime, human resources were precious; therefore, the government encouraged its people to have more kids. On the contrary, human resources are not essential now, and we don't really need our offspring to take care of our elder lives; the government can serve us well. Besides, on account of our developed medical condition, we can live quite a long time; thus, the fertility rate is bound to decrease. 

Third, women's social status has been promoted. Modern women have a high level of education, they know the risk of having kids on their bodies and careers. Hence, they have the right to decide when they give birth. 

In conclusion, they are the three main reasons why more people decide to have children later in their life.",6
People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"It is widely believed that one solution to environmental problems would be for governments to hike up the price of petrol. While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue that other measures might have an even greater impact.
On the one hand, raising the cost of fuel for cars and other modes is one of the efficient way because of some reasons. Firstly, higher fuel prices can help to limit the number of car journeys. A large number of low and middle income earners are not able to afford the incease in the cost of petrol, therefore they are forced to adapt to other means of transport such as: bicycle, walking, train, bus, etc. Traveling by public transportation instead private cars is the necessary way to cut down on car emission and reduce greenhouse effect. Secondly, the extra money, which collected from increasing fuel prices can be used in order to compensate for the extra expense. Government can raise expenditure on upgrading and expand public facilities and transportation to suffice residents. 
On the other hand, while this rise in petrol costs might be a useful stopgap measure, national authorities could apply some other solutions to tackle this problem. The first measure is to invest money in developing eco-friendly means of transport. People should be encouraged to use electric cars and motorbikes to prevent air pollution. Moreover, introducing free bus and train passes, as the increased use of public transport would help in the effort to combat global warming. Another measure is to raise people awareness of the need to cut down on emissions from their cars. Environmental campaigns shoud be carried out more, especially on social media to popularize residents efficient ways to protect the environment. 
In conclusion, a sharp rise in petrol prices would be a useful environmental friendly transport measure, although in the longer term other steps would be more effective.",5
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Children are the future of nation.  They contributes in the economy  and represent their country worldwide but nowadays youth is lacking focus on their studies in institute. There are several causes of this like environment, technological gadgets and not participation in other activities.

The first reason that comes in my mind is their home environment. Sometimes pupils suffers from bad situations in their homes which ruins their concentration from studies. For example, when children see their parents suffering from poor financial condition or their mother has been suffered from domestic violence. The second reason is, children use mobiles, computers all the time which somehow impacts their health and mind. They get addiction of using these technical devices. Therefore, in schools students think about videos games and other stuff which they always see into these gadgets. The third reason is not getting  time to get engaged into hobbies and play with their friends. For instance, some guardians force their children to focus only on studies all the time either they are at home or school. This forceful condition automatically moves them away from studies as they always try to find some way to do other activities like play.

There are numerous ways that can solve this problem and helps to increase their concentration on studies. As an example enough time has been provided by their guardians to get involve in games and sports. In this way they will feel fresh as well as  their brain will get active and they becomes happy which will directly increase their interest in studies. Moving further, parents should give them limited access of using mobiles and tablets because overuse of these devices has a bad effect on their wellness. In schools, extra activities and task should be provided by their mentors. So that they can participate in sports and other volunteer activities which help them in many ways.

In conclusion, parents, family and teachers all should take care of the mental state of children  that how they are behaving and why they are lacking concentration from their studies because there is a possibility of any reason behind that they are not doing well in studies in schools and classroom.",4
"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.
Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","There are approximately 196 countries in the world, each following their own business strategies and a unique culture. It is the duty of everyone to appreciate and respect their cultural diversity in order to maintain peace and harmony across the globe. Increasing trade and cultural exchange between countries has both advantages and disadvantages. Let me discuss both aspects and conclude with my personal opinion.

To embark with the advantages, trade connection between the two nations promote a smooth and friendly relation among them. It assists in setting up a mutual collaboration and foreign investment in our province, thereby increasing the job opportunity for the graduated youngsters. The country's economic status is greatly improved through these marketing relations and is one of the better ideas in assisting a nation's progress in development. Also, by allowing cultural contact, their diversity can be familiarized worldwide, where everyone can know about the different traditions followed across the globe.

To view the negative aspects, a country's identity starts to fade through these type of commerce as the other nation might dominate us. For example, the business collaboration between India and China has resulted in loss of former country's identity, wherein most of the population prefers to buy the products made in China. This has greatly resulted in depreciation in value for the native products due to the preference given to foreign articles. Also, there are high chances of some particular culture or tradition getting extinct due to their over  diversification.

By summarizing the above said points, the advantages overweigh the disadvantages of such business and cultural relations. So I deeply agree that developing trade collaboration can greatly influence the nation's economic level in a positive way other than improving cultural diversity across the globe.",7
"Many jobs used to be done at home by hand, but nowadays an increasing number of them are done using machines instead. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of 
this development.","In this modern world of advanced technology, people were more relying on home appliances for daily household activities as in the past they do all of it by themselves. 

The invention of advanced electronic machines is helping people to save time, which they invest in doing regular housekeeping activities.

For instance, washing machines help people to save  their precious time and energy which they spent on washing clothes by hand in the past. Moreover, it helps parents to save time, which they can enjoy with their children.

However, there are few cons associated with use of machines such as health problems.

There was a survey conducted by local newspaper which revealed that people who do not use home appliances were more healthy than people who were in the habit of using them. If we talk about microwaves, it got banned from Japan because use of it was leading to serious health problems like cancer, hypertension. 

According to me we should only use these appliances when required so that we can maintain a healthy lifestyle.",1

"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Education is of prime importance to the children. Whether or not a child should be Homeschooled is a very personal opinion and belief of the parents. Formal knowledge starts at the age of 3 right until lifetime. Everyone should have the right to be educated. This way  of study such as happens in the form of a brick and mortar or the education can happen in the house. Moreover, the choice is left with the parents to decide which of the two to opt for. In this essay, we shall discuss the pros and cons of the statement.

The advantage of home school would be parents have utmost control. Another would be instilling religion. This study at home concept is useful for kids who are handicapped in any form. The self confidence is upheld. In other words, the morale of the growing adult is always high. Few parents who wish for their kid to visit the museum more often and to do more outdoor course for learning in the house.  Some more parents are dissatisfied with normal schooling due to lack of solid educational institutes. For example.  Learning on your own in  the United States constitutes the education of about 3.4% of U.S. Students (approximately 2 million students).  

However, the biggest disadvantage would be the student having problems to socialize.  The individual may even have problems to communicate. Furthermore, making friends would be a difficult task in hand. The kid would have never handled exams and homeworks. How to deal with pressure is something not taught at home. Not only is the person unprepared to face the world, but also are unaware of the unknown. 

To conclude, way of schooling is a choice left for the parents to decide for their kid. Home learning has its own pluses. Finally, in my opinion everyone should have the opportunity to be in a proper school as it makes him/her prepared for the future. 14 years of education in an institute is unmatched and unparalleled.",7
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"People may have thought that teenagers should help the society in their spare time without any return to gain both personal and social outcome. I disagree with the idea that teenagers must to do the unpaid work, and I believe that it can still be beneficial by doing other kind of things.

On the one hand, adolescent should not be asked to do extra works without payoff. The main reason is that the youth have right to choose what to do on their free time. Teenagers can spend their extra time in finding their interests or relaxing. For instance, students who are busy in weekdays might want to use their free time hanging out with friends rather than doing community affairs. Furthermore, some youngsters are responsible for family’s financial support that they have to take a part-time job for houseware and the tuition fee.

On the other hand, there are other types of thing that juvenile can do to benefit both individuals and societies. Firstly, they can learn some skills based on their interest. For instance, those who enjoy swimming can get a life guard certificate, and that’s not only for a sense of honor, but also an ability to rescue drowning people. Secondly, students can have an internship in a company to achieve bountiful experiences, and may lower the city’s unemployment rate. Lastly, they can choose to take a rest and think more about future, which is important to career development.

In conclusion, teenagers should not be taught to help local communities if they have more time, and they can gain extra benefits by using their time on finding their interests, having internship or just relaxing.",5
"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believe by some cultures that younger family members should be responsible for elders in the family by law once they no loger have enough strength to look after themselves in both physically and mentally ways. This has become a controversial issue. From my point of view, I am disagreed with this idea and reckon it should not be made legal. The reasons for my argument will be explained further in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached.

Some segments of society are thinking that it is a neccessary job for descendants to take care of the elderly when they become physically and mentally weak. However, I strongly disagree with this, not with the fact that pupils taking care of elders but with the belief that it should be made legal. I always think that it is a good deed for youth to look after their family members, but this should be an optional choice. Everyone have their own rights to choose on whether they want or do not want to do something. Furthermore, it is found by one of the surveys that some people, including young ages, are not ready to hold others' lives in hands because they are still struggling with their own lives. To illustrate this, think about a person who work all day and night but still surrounded by problems such as financial, working, and educational issues. Therefore, it would be best for these people to look after their family members when they are ready or it would gives them more burden.

In conlusion, even though some populations believe that the younger members of the family should be legally responsible for the elderly, I disagree with this and think that everyone must have their rights to choose. Hence, it should not be made as a legal law but should be an optional choice. The offsprings must look after others when they think they are ready and do not have any other burden.",1
"Some people think the news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Most people admit this century is the intelligence, technological era. Some people believe read the news in the newspapers and watch television news programs are wasting time. I partly agree this statement due to several reasons which will be mentioned in this essay. 
To begin with, reading or watching the news is beneficial and essential factors in our soul.  People who also knows the news, they are able to easily understand the world especially, politics. Currently, overriding news is global pandemic CoVID-19. Every day, even every hour was updated this news. This intelligence is fascinating to everyone. Cause of everyone wants to know how it is increasing onward and how to beware of this virus. Another benefit of TV, on this condition, namely in     quarantine pupils are studying via TV or Internet. Because everyone is staying home, no one can go out without permission. In addition, reading, a wide range of news categories such as politics, economy, and entertainment will broaden your spectrum of knowledge. If you are specialized in any fields like medicine or science, medical and scientific news will intensify your knowledge accumulation. 
On the other hand, read or watch too much news, it is really wasting time and  it will be detrimental. The cause of it is reading or watching much out of the norm, it will face clue flow. As a result, these things will distribute of our personal activity. Hence, there are some explanations for why people refuse to obtain the news. The most popular one is that the data from the news does not directly connect with their lives. It is obvious that we cannot recognize any relationship between a worker's heart and a report about the status of the war in the Middle East or the change political system of a country in the all the side of the world. However, I believe that it is just a lack of the perspective of how crucial knowledge could be in one's growth.  
In conclusion, I strongly believe that, read the news in the newspaper 	
And watch television news programs have several advantages, while some people claim that is wasting time. 
I would strongly recommend people read newspapers every day to keep up with the progress of social development",6
"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of  artists including painters, musicians and poets, etc. However, other people think  that is a waste of money.","Many people’s lives are richer because of art – music, paintings, calligraphy, pictures,  sculpture, poems and dance. There are some who claim that it is important to support  the artists, and others who are opposed to government funding. In the following  paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument and finally give my opinion.  There are many reasons why government should fund artists. The contributions of  artists to the society are very essential. Art can bring out people’s creativity, views and  personalities. For example, we learn about our history, traditions and culture through  movies, songs and paintings made by artists. Artists are the media of diffusing  tradition. All kinds of tradition are the basis of a country without which the country  can’t be civilised. So artists are the ambassadors of culture and play a vital role in  elevating the level of civilization of the country. It is a major form of cultural  abundance.  Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of communication.  Our language is a result of people’s need to communicate. Art is what differentiates us  from animals. Art is our soul and it is a source of courage. Artists also entertain us.  Finally, government should fund artists because earning a livelihood from art is  difficult especially in the budding stages.  Opponents of government funding on artists say that money spent on the arts could  have been used for considerably more vital purposes. They have strong reasons as a  nation’s health and wellbeing should be paramount. The idea that elderly people are  forced to wait for essential operations whilst the money required to increase available  medical provision is spent on opera and ballet is plainly immoral. There are also more  deserving social causes for the money that should be considered before the arts.  Homelessness, unemployment, illiteracy – all of these deserve to be addressed before  money is spent on what is essentially little more than entertainment.  To summarise, I would like to say that as both sides have strong arguments, it depends  on the condition of the country. In developed countries where even the poorest of the  poor have all the basic amenities of life, government should spend on art and artists  but in countries where people are dying of starvation and diseases, other matters  should be given priority.",1
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students 
are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it 
will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give 
your own opinion","The quality of education is very essential in our society, in order to create leaders with bright a future.  However,  the government and many organisations become more concerned about how to improve the educational sector. Many suggested that the best way to do this,  is to seek the opinion of the students  as well as accepting criticism against their tutors, others disagree with this suggestion.  In this essay, I will discuss both views, and give my opinion. 

First of all, seeking the opinion of the students is indeed a better way to increase the quality of education, this will enable the governments and other bodies to identify any difficulties the students are facing and to be able to make any necessary adjustments. For example, I taught a group of students few years ago, and discovered only a few of the children were able to understand, but when I seek their opinion on how to make them understand better,  I was able to assist these children in a better way.  Therefore, these students encounter different challenges every day, but asking for their opinion will help tutors to understand how to impart knowledge in each student. 

On the other hand, the students may take for granted when asked to give reasons for their difficulties. They might use that freedom of speech to blame teachers whom they dislike, and to accuse tutors that have their interest at heart, this in turn could lead to hatred between the tutors and the learners. For example, in Nigeria some group of students gang beats a teacher who flogged them in the classroom for not reading their books. If such ones were asked to give an opinion on bow to increase the quality of education, they will obviously blame such teacher.

To conclude,  seeking the opinion of the learners  has its advantages and disadvantages, however,  the advantages outweigh the disadvantages considering students who are really  willing to learn.",8
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","At present, in most of cities and towns of all countries across the globe, the dispute of traffic congestion is looming large. For this situation, people can not be solely blamed, but many other factors play  significant roles too. To mimic this dilemma, many steps should be taken into consideration by governments.
 
To begin with, among all the reasons, the prevalence is, almost all citizens of the nation use their private vehicles owing to their convenience instead of commuting through (by) public transportation which is comparatively cheaper as well safer. In other words, they do not want to take any risk or face adversity during their travelling and (to) reach to the destination on time. Besides, the other causes behind such complication could be stray animals who wander on roads and due to them sometime the person get stuck in transportation jams. Also there are other factors which have been responsible since (for) many years such as ignorance of (on) shipment rules, ramshackle vehicles, careless pedestrians etc.

The effective possible measures, to make cities and town's traffic–free areas have enlisted below. First and foremost, governments should build sidewalks for pedestrians. So, they may walk safely and do not meet an accident. Another way to tackle this obstacle is, the fuel cost must be increased which ultimately discourage people for utilization of their own vehicles and consequently they are forced to travel either by public transportations or share the personal vehicles. For instance, if two people are living in the same areas and they both are employees of same company then they both can go to office by sharing one car or a motorcycle. In addition, every person must maintain his scooter in good condition. So that it does not cause any difficulty while running and on account of it the speed of other vehicles do not (need to) slow down which might lead to gridlock jams.",5
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The environmental problem indeed needs the utmost attention. Some think that increasing fuel prices for transportation can be the most efficient solution to tackling the environmental problem. I strongly disagree with that notion, I believe that there is another option that can be more effective than to rise the cost of fuel. This essay will elaborate on my standpoint thoroughly with the following evidence.

To commence with, it is unarguable that the emission of vehicles brings myriad pollution, especially to the air quality. Hence, some people think the idea of increasing the cost of fuel will deliberately persuade people to consider leaving the use of private vehicles for public transportation. However, that notion proved ineffective to tackle environmental problems. Take Indonesia for an instance, the government has implemented the idea of raising fuel prices which depicted the results that people still insist on using private transportation rather than public vehicle. Thus, there is no reduction in the number of active transportation, in other words, there is no pollution depletion occurred.

In addition, there is another solution that is possibly effective to solve the environmental problem which is improving the quality of public vehicles. Instead of increasing fuel prices, the government should pay attention to developing public transportation which is the main reason why the public is most likely avoid to using it. Take Singapore as an example, the massive development and advancement in public transportation such as MRT and LRT is an inevitable success in persuading every resident to utilize that public transportation rather than a private car. As a result, the quality of air in Singapore is improved compared to Indonesia which still lacks of public transportation.

 

In conclusion, it is valid that the numerous active transportation, especially private vehicles is being the cause of the environmental problem that emerged. Thus, the government will deliberately concern about how to decrease the number of vehicles. Although increasing the fuel rate is believed can be effective to solve environmental pollution, focusing more on developing sophisticated vehicles is profoundly effective to attract people to switch their transportation modes. In other words, it can reduce a lot of private car use which can help to solve environmental pollution.",6
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"In today’s modern society, it can be difficult for students to pay attention or concentrate on lessons at school. The reasons for this are diverse, and thus it requires suitable approaches for children to tackle this problem. 

To begin with, there are certain reasons why children are unable to concentrate on learning at school. First, technological advancement is one of the main reasons. Nowadays, most children have smartphones or computers to study and entertain. This is due to the fact that their parents are so busy with their work, so they cannot help their children to learn at home. Consequently, students can learn on the internet with video records and apps, which are more interesting than theoretical knowledge at school. Second, teenagers have to study long hours every day. Apart from studying at school, they must go to extra classes for many subjects such as math, literature or English. As a consequence, they cannot have a break to rest so they cannot pay full attention to all subjects at school.

To tackle this issue, some measures can be adopted. To begin with, teachers at school should make the lessons diverse for children to increase their interests. For instance, more activities and experiments should be included such as visiting the museum about history after finishing a lesson in this subject. Moreover, parents could help their children to organize a more reasonable timetable for studying. Therefore, students can pay attention and concentrate on subjects at school. Besides, if they have more time, they could develop their aptitude and find out their favourite subject.

In conclusion, there are many culprits of distracting children such as technological advancements and a hectic studying schedule, and their teachers and parents can have a lot of methods to solve this problem.",8
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Celebrities play a vital role in modern society. Recently, there have been many celebrities who became famous for their talented singing voices or sport skills like baseketball. These celebrities include singers, athletes, basketball players and even politicians. Clearly, such significant celebrities can spread any ideas and go trends around the world though they may convey false information to young people.

Several celebrities are considerably rich and glamorous though their wealth and glamor are likely to misunderstand young people. That is, the more wealth and glamor celebrities have, the more likely young people would like to become these celebrities. Many young people consider that celebrities are so wealthy that they are able to purchase a tremendous amount of the luxuries. Young people affected by materialism prefer to buy products of expensive brands inclusive of Chenel, Supreme and Apple. Moreover, teenagers who want to be celebrities may take unreasonable videos onto social media websites involving Youtube and TikTok. However, such unreasonable videos can attract many viewers to see and increase the click rates on the Internet.

In order to solve these biased behaviors for teenagers, celebrities should set an example to donate their wealth to charities. In addition, governments are supposed to establish a law to control illegal videos on social media websites and punish those who violate law. In that way, not only celebrities can build a wonderfully personal image in the society but also youngsters are capable of following celebrities with admirable behaviors.

In conclusion, celebrities definitely have a large influence for individuals in daily life. They can bring considerable thoughts to everyone. Nevertheless, teenagers may show off their wealth and make unreasonable videos on social media websites because of these celebrities. If celebrities donate money to charities and governments establish legislation to punish people who upload illegal videos onto the Internet, youngsters can follow the remarkable steps of their favorite celebrities and do help for the world.",3
"Some people say that what children watch influences their behaviours. Others believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behaviours the most. 
    Discuss both views and give your opinion
","In contemporary society, there are many things which leave significant impacts to children, particularly their behaviors. Due to this fact, some people consider that what the youngsters watch on TV will affect to them. Meanwhile, the others argue that the time they spend on watching TV will influence their behaviors a lot. In my opinion, I concur with the idea that children will be influenced by the content they watch on TV. 

On the one hand, spending a big amount of time on television may result in the addiction of watching many hours. Because the young generations are in the process of development, they are curious about new things. Therefore, children find it interesting in watching TV for undiscovered things as well as their curiosity. 

However, this leads to the fact that eye diseases may be caused. If children focus on watching several hours, the strength of their eyes will be alleviated. Hence, children are likely to have illnesses such as myopic and hypermetropic. For instance, my younger brother had watched TV through days and nights. As a result, he is at level 5 of myopic at the moment. 

On the other hand, the content on the TV will transmiss both benefits and drawbacks. Not only children can be educated by education channels, but also they can be harmed by pornography as well as violable words.Thus, every channels on the television should be controlled by the authorities with a view to ensuring the safety content.

To sum up, both of the ideas will have impacts on the children’s behaviours, but I nuture the opinion that what the youngsters watch will influence themselves.

"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. why is this the case? which development do you think this better?","First, driving a car is more convenient and comfortable than cycling. Therefore, when going to workplaces or hanging out with friends, the car is a reasonable choice. The other reason for this point is when compared with vehicles like cars or motorbikes; cycling is not time effective. For instance, with the same distance, it would take drivers double or triple faster than bicycle riders.

It is also true that riding bikes becoming increasingly popular in some urban areas. Due to exhaust fumes from cars, which may have a devastating effect on the planet and lead to global warming, cycling might be expected to cut down emissions. Also, Riding a bike is essential for health not only maintain a healthy body but also reduce the risk of some diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases.

In conclusion, these points have both pros and cons depends on the urban citizen view. In my opinion, although there are several benefits of driving a car, I would argue that cycling is a greater choice and it should be encouraged by the urban authorities.",2
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth. And that’s why authorities struggled with lack of residential land where builders can construct fresh accommodation. It is agreed that only government can eliminate this issue. This essay outline actions that can be taken in order to fix it up.

 

It is believed that officials could influence on a a lot of process in the cities. And one of them is encouraging people to move countryside. For instance, in year 2001 town Bakersfield in USA was experiencing dramatic growth. Subsequently,it invoked some unpleasant consequences. So local authorities decided to adjust it by encouraging people to move in a villages. They started used all possible methods to involve people. And one of them is using social media to inform people as for all benefits living in village. Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village. In results,near 15 percentage of local population moved countries.

Returning again to job question, governments of the country should provide more vacancy suggestions in the rural areas, as more than 90 percentage of people moved to metropolis just for getting a well-paid job. It would be nice to mention latest poll conducted by authorities of the Maharashtra province demonstrated that near 35 percentage of youths don’t wanna live in a large city,but forced to do that, due to luck of job suggestions. 

So, If job opportunities increased,people would be more willing to move countryside.

However ,it should be mentioned, that citizens and builders also play an important role in solving this problem. They could help authorities by doing at least something like invest more in building skyscrapers and flats. Apartment usually require less space on the land, whereas, bungalows require it more. 

To summarise, there are some  possible ways to deal with lack of housing is encouraging people to move countryside and provides more job opportunities there. Therefore, shortage of housing can’t be completed solved by citizens ,but for government. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted",1
"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this contemporary era, every citizen of a country must deserve a basic education in order to survive in the competitive world. Consequently, there has been a growing body of opinion that governments should more invest in educating elderly people who are uneducated rather than spending too much money on the education of youngsters so as to create an unbiased society. Being a rational mind, I, however, take issue with this notion, for I am of the view that concentration on young people’s education helps a nation generates a strong workforce and becomes an independent state.

Among the ratiocination to buttress my stance, the one that deals with the significance of adolescents’ education as a way of producing productive human resources. In other words, if a country gives the highest priority to provide state-of-the-art teaching facilities to its juveniles, after a certain period these children work to change the fate and face of their country. To exemplify, 30 years ago, Malaysia decided to spend 30% of the country’s yearly budget on the education of youngsters, resulting in producing top-class professionals every year. Thus with a view to having highly qualified workforces, it is paramount to invest money in the education of young people. 

Another critical rationale in reference to why governments ought to focus on juveniles’ education instead of adults’ education is necessarily synonymous with becoming an autocratic and self-dependent state. To be more precise, when youngsters would be highly skilled and educated, a country does not have to depend on professionals, migrating from other nations. This opportunity could not be enjoyed if governments had to spend funds on the education of adults because of their limited learning capacity and age. To cite an example, China has now become a completely self-reliant country only because of giving priority to the education of adolescents. Hence, so as to become a developed nation, young people’s education is vital.

In conclusion, a country’s government should give more concentration on the education of youngsters in order to create productive citizens and become independent. In this contemporary era, every citizen of a country must deserve a basic education in order to survive in the competitive world. Consequently, there has been a growing body of opinion that governments should more invest in educating elderly people who are uneducated rather than spending too much money on the education of youngsters so as to create an unbiased society.

The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"It is often believed that the reach of technological advancements has been one of the reasons for creating a gap between people with different classes of income while others assert that technology is bringing the rich and poor people together. This essay shall discuss both views. In my opinion, I believe technology is creating differences between people with higher income and lower income.

Technology has provided many opportunities for the inclusion of poor people in income-earning activities. Various job platforms have allowed unemployed people to know the employment available and grab the opportunities. For instance, there are applications where people can hire housemaids, which helps housewives to earn a certain level of income. In addition, awareness programs and training are run by different organizations. Also, organizations are providing donations and their products as a social responsibility to encourage the use of technology. There is a company in India which is providing convertible wheelchairs to specially-abled groups of people which can be used for transportation. This has allowed them to get involved in money-generating activities like the delivery of food.

On the other side, the cost of technology is quite higher which may not be affordable for people with a low scale of earning. The major focus of poor people is on basic needs and there is a certain class of people who depend on earning a single day to fulfill their needs on same day. In the context of Nepal, the price of a smartphone starts from Rs. 10,000 which may not be affordable. Moreover, in this materialistic world, the success and hierarchy of individuals are compared based on material possession. The possession of cars, costly gadgets, and so on is considered rich. It is observed that students with such belongings are forming a group and bullying those who do not have one.

In conclusion, though technological developments have brought innovations making the life of people easier and allowing platforms to earn money, other factors associated such as price and impression of people have been contributing to creating differences. The companies involved should focus on how all groups of people could be involved.",6
some people think that museums should be enjoulyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate people . discuss both views and give your opinion,"Some people argue that museums are entertainment places.while others believe it is an educational places. However I am with museum as educational purposes and this essay will examine the reason.

To begin with,museums from the enjoyable perspectives, individuals prefer visiting museums to enjoy their time and observe the differences between past and present . In  other words, individuals  travel abroad to visit museums in their vacation because they found relaxation and they feel inspired .For instance, the survey done in 2023 at Sultan Qaboos University showed  the number of visitors who visit Oman museums yearly more than 100 thousands  .Therefore, it seems logical that museums are one of the entertainment places.

On the other hand, museums from educational perspective, it is the best way to learn specially for students because explaining subjects likewise history with visible materials it helps to understand the subject better and it gives students cleare idea but, if they study without trip to museum the information in the book is just abstract words . For example according to Oman TV student understands the Mona Lisa subject more when they see it in museums and they know all the details related to this painting.This means it  is a method for studying and the benefits of museums for education purposes is huge, 

To sum up,  although some argue that museums is enjoulyable places because people go there to enjoy their free time. I believe it is educational due to the learning trips give the learners all the information that they need and it is a visible method.",3
"Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.
The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.
The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.
In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This",4
Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that to tackle the problem of illness and diseases produced by environmental pollution and housing problems ministry should focus on. I firmly agree with this statement 

rule should take care of increasing environmental pollutions day by day. The principal benefit is our society will stay healthy if there is no air pollution people those who are having asthma can easy cure themself. Secondarily,Our environmental cycle will be balanced with taking strike actions by the government. For instance, the government should make a law against cutting trees and hunting animals because they play an important role in our environmental cycle by giving us fresh oxygen.

furthermore, Some people cut  trees and greenery for their personal benefits.For example, nowadays farmers are selling their land to colonizers to make residential colonies to fend of this government should make apartment buildings to give shelters to many people in one shed. In addition, the government should separate the residential area from the industrial area by which pollution coming from the industries will not effects human health that much.

 In conclusion,there are so many steps that government should take to prevents this problem in positive result. it can be tackled with the collaborative efforts of government and individuals.",1
"Many university students cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","It is widely known that there are many university graduates who are unable to work in their desired fields after they finish their studies. This essay will elucidate the causes behind this phenomenon and offer solutions to tackle the problems.

To begin with, the most common reason is the fact that fresh graduates usually do not have the technical skills that their chosen profession requires. Possessing technical knowledge is an essential factor that employers consider when assessing job applicants. Meanwhile, university students tend to focus more on theoretical aspects rather than practical sides. Furthermore, this circumstance is exacerbated by limited job availability due to  increasing competition in job markets. To cite an example, there are fewer jobs in government institutions than the number of students holding a degree in political science. 

Nonetheless, there are certainly some steps that can be taken to face those challenges. Firstly, university students should take internship jobs prior to applying to full-time jobs. Having more exposure to the professional world, students can identify the practical skills they need in order to excel in those jobs. After completing internships, they can also consider finding jobs in different cities to increase the probability of finding their dream occupations. For instance, they can try to browse jobs in the top five largest cities in their country. 

In conclusion, the main rationales that hinder university graduates from getting their desired profession are twofold, they are the lack of technical abilities and the low number of job postings. University students can mitigate these by joining internship programs and expanding their job-searching efforts",7
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this
sets a bad example to the young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that most of the celebrities are well known for their luxurious lifestyle than for their talent or performance nowadays. The majority of people believe that this kind of attitude is not a good example for the younger generation. I am inclined to believe that this kind of behavior would be a bad example for society.

However, there are other famous people who are popular for their outstanding acting or voice

.

On the one hand, it is a fact that many famous people become popular due to their fancy lifestyle, instead of their outstanding achievement these days. Their talent might be standard or below the average, but they are making sensation to the public by showing their wealth and glamour lifestyle. For example, famous American Kardasian-Jenner family who are recognized for their reality television program. In this show they are showing luxurious mansions, parties and shopaholic lifestyle. It is believed that such behavior would have negative influence for the young people and teach them incorrect style of life.

On the other hand, there are celebrities who are popular for their incredible acting or stanning voice. These people have shown to the world that they have achieved success due to strong determination and diligence, and the public will always remember them for their masterpiece and great achievements. For instance, actor and producer Jim Carrey is famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. Before getting the lead role and becoming famous, countless failures were waiting for him. Despite all this, he did not give up and now he is one of the most popular comedian actors today.

In conclusion, even if there are several celebrities who are well known for their wealth, expensive apartments and fancy style of life, there are other celebrities who are famous due to their great talent. In my opinion, I think the public should be more selective in choosing their role models, not just in front of the camera, but we should also see from their personal life as well.",2
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","In contemporary society, some schools removed abilities such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork because they believe that these subjects should not be learned at school as it is better to learn these from family and peers. Therefore, some think that schools should pay attention to studying academics so that students can succeed and pass examinations. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this proposition believe that it is beneficial for students if institutions focus on curriculums. There is no denying that academic knowledge is important to children to apply for jobs in the future. For example, some positions in a company such as manager, analyst, and executive have to use academic knowledge rather than professional skills. Moreover, when kids learn about physical abilities like woodwork in their free time with their friends or family, they can develop relationships through  cooperation. As a result, institutions remove vocational subjects in order to give more time to learn for students.

On the other hand, those who argue this idea think that schools should not decrease the time the educating vocational curricula. It is obvious that when students exceed focus on academic study, they can get a street which makes it impossible to carry. For instance, when some students do not pass the exam, they may get depressed. Furthermore, some companies need people who have  professional abilities.

In conclusion, schools should not teach capacities like dressmaking but should encourage students to be educated in academic subjects so as to succeed. In my view, I strongly agree with this issue because academic subjects are too easy to find work.",6
"some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The need for human relationships has changed over time.Some people think that we are becoming more dependant on each other, While others believe that mankind has become more independent. The essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail.

A human being is social animals and they have a constant need to be in touch with someone of their kind. We have started relying on each other in various aspect of life whether it's networking for a better opportunity , career growth or merely for speaking our heart out. For example, One of my friends received a promotion within the first year of the job as she was really good with interacting with others which made her aware of possible opportunities which in turn helped her in a career move. On the other hand, remember the time when you were too stressed, the thing that you wanted to do is call up your mom, friend or your huslabel. Just the fact that there is someone who will listen to you gives the peace. We have built our lives based on these encounters that's why we will always be dependent on each other.

As they say it, We are in the digital age and every need of ours can be fulfilled with just a click of a button and believe me so has the need to interact with other people. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have changed our world as never before. For instance previously if you were too lazy to move to switch off light, you would someone crossing to do the task for you but  now we have Alexa who does the task  plus entertains you with music, news and converses with you and we fall in love with her. It was so beautifully showcased in the movie Her. Another reason we have become self-sufficient is to be able to survive the competition and to achieve success. I myself have lived in five states all by myself in search of a better career opportunity which teaches you to be self-reliant. In simple terms technology and need for growth has made us independent.

To conclude, Being social animals there will always be a need for other people and because of technology,we have become independent. In my view,we are still relying on people in our toughest time even if we have become self-supporting.",7
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the cause of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","The high quantity of vehicle makes heavy traffic in several big cities and there are a few causes that led to this mess. Some actions can be done to tackle this chaos caused by high volume.

In busy hours, most people will stuck in heavy traffic and end up to spent more times than normal traffic. In fact, this catastrophe happens because lack of adequate public transportation. Citizens often confused how to commute and they think that by using current public transportation, they still need to walk more than five kilometers to finally find a bus stop.
