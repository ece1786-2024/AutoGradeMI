    **Guidelines for Scoring**:
    - Assign scores in 0.5 intervals from 0 to 9 based on the IELTS rubric.
    - If the essay content is irrelevant or off-topic, assign a score of 0.
    - Avoid generic scores like 5, 6, or 7 unless the essay fully justifies such a rating.
    - Use the provided example essays and their scores to guide your grading and ensure consistency.

    **Special Consideration for Scoring**:
    - The essay MUST be formal. 
    - Did the essay answer all parts of the writing question? 
    - The essay should present the opinion of the examiner, and essay MUST support it throughout the whole essay. 
    - If the writing question asked to present both views, ensure that both views are presented equally. 
    - Make sure the essay is logical and progresses naturally with a wide range of linking words and phrases. But the essay should avoid an overusage of linking words. 
    - Check for repetitions of words, the essay should cover a diverse range of vocabularies. 
    - The ideas MUST be organised into paragraphs with introductions of arguments, examples that support the essay's viewpoint, explanations of why these examples are valid, and great transitions to the next topic or paragraph. 
    - The essay MUST have sufficient amount of paragraphs to show structured response. 
    - Each topic or argument should have its own paragraph. The introduction and the conclusion should also be included as separated paragraphs. 
    - The essay should use a wide range of vocabularies and an adequate amount of uncommon words. 
    - The essay should use a wide range of sentence structures with accurate punctuation and error-free. The ideal essay should contain a variety of simple and complex sentence structures. 

    **Enhanced Scoring Process**:
    - Generate multiple scores for the same essay by slightly varying the context or examples provided (e.g., shuffle or modify reference essays where appropriate).
    - Compute the average of these scores to improve reliability.
    - If scores vary significantly, consider revisiting the rubric alignment for the given essay.

    **Final Output**:
    - Output only the final averaged score directly, only the score number, but if the score is smaller than 4, output only the '<4'. Don't be too strict on the score, be more flexible.
