### Task Response
Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the task by addressing both sides of the argument and providing an opinion. However, your argument needs to be further developed. For a higher score, ensure that your essay covers the points in more depth and includes specific examples to support these points. For instance, when discussing how art fosters creativity, you could elaborate on specific skills children develop through art and why they are beneficial. Similarly, explaining the drawbacks with evidence would strengthen your argument against art being considered a waste of time.

### Coherence and Cohesion
Your essay follows a logical structure by introducing the topic, discussing both sides, and providing an opinion. However, coherence can be improved by ensuring smooth transitions between ideas.

Each idea should be presented in a separate paragraph with an introductory sentence that links the paragraph with your thesis or previous paragraph.

Your vocabulary demonstrates some variety, but there are repetitive choices and occasional inappropriate uses of words. Aim to use a wider range of vocabulary and ensure that each word fits the context precisely. For example, ""offsprings"" is not a suitable formal term in this context; ""children"" would be more appropriate. Also, phrases like ""wastage of time"" could be replaced with ""waste of time"" for better clarity.

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy
Your grammatical range is limited; there are several errors that impede understanding and clarity. These include incorrect use of commas, run-on sentences, and awkward phrasing (""offprints at the School,"" “spending turn on art subject”). Improving sentence variety and accuracy is crucial.

On the one hand,supporters of the idea that art is mandatory for students believe that art is mainly based on creative ideas. As,painting and sketches drawn by someone reflect truly about the creative nature of the person. Take the example of well known artist, Sadqain,his masterpieces are a real reflection of creativity of his mind revealing that how beautifully he summarized the ideas on canvas.Thus acquiring knowledge about art is considered to be imperative for growing minds of offsprings because of creativity. 

While on the other hand,advocates of the view that art is merely a waste of the time believe that spending turn on art subject offers no benefit because of the latest advancements and innovations in contemporary era. As, all developments are just because of the science subjects and no significant role of art is visible. For instance, a recent survey at university of Stanford revealed that over a quarter of students in the speciality of art were unable to make success in practical life merely because of the time wasted on this subject.Hence, studying art leads to waste of time. 

Whereas,I believe that learning art delivers creative ideas in a person's mind and it has long term benefits.So it has a good impact on minds of adolescents. 

To conclude, spending time on art offers an abundance of advantages, especially the creativity and one should not consider it a useless subject.","In today's educational landscape, the role of art in the school curriculum is a topic of continuing debate. Some individuals assert that art is a crucial component of education because it cultivates creativity and enriches children's cognitive development. In contrast, others argue that art is an unnecessary diversion that does not contribute to students' success in the modern, technology-driven world. I firmly support the view that art is vital for children as it fosters numerous essential skills. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives before presenting my opinion.

Proponents of including art in the school curriculum often emphasize its ability to nurture creativity in young minds. Art encourages children to think imaginatively and express their thoughts and feelings in unique ways. This creative process can lead to the development of critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, skills highly valued in various fields. For instance, studies have shown that children engaged in arts education often perform better academically, demonstrating improved cognitive abilities and innovative thinking skills. Additionally, art can be a medium through which students develop fine motor skills and attention to detail, further supporting their overall intellectual growth.

Conversely, those who view art as a waste of time point out the rapid advancements in science and technology as justification for minimizing its importance. In an era where STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields are thriving and often seen as the key to a successful career, art is perceived by some as peripheral to these pursuits. They argue that a focus on art may detract from the time and resources necessary to excel in STEM subjects. Recent statistics highlight the rising demand for technically-skilled professionals, reinforcing the belief that educational priorities should align with job market needs.

Nevertheless, equating art merely with leisure or a lack of utility overlooks its substantial benefits. Engaging with art can equip students with emotional intelligence and empathy, qualities that are increasingly recognized as critical to personal and professional success. Art provides a platform for cultural expression and understanding, enabling students to develop a broader perspective of the world and appreciate diverse viewpoints.

In conclusion, while it's understandable that some question the practicality of art in an education system oriented towards technological advancement, the holistic benefits of art education must not be underestimated. Art contributes significantly to developing well-rounded individuals who are capable of thinking creatively and innovatively, which are indispensable traits in any field. Therefore, art should remain an essential subject in schools, cultivating a generation that is not only academically proficient but also enriched with creativity and empathy."
