This essay will explore what might be the causes and methods of how  society can find out the information. \n\nThe primary reason for exploring their residence is due to the huge investment in owning a property. Therefore, they are keen on taking precautious measures to secure their financing, which can be threatening if the property has terrible notorieties. For instance, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people fear such incidents will somehow happen in the future. This bad reputation could drop the market value of the place. Besides that, homeowners are more concerned about the durability of their house structures due to climate change that affects every continent in the world.\n\nThere are various methods to discover it. The first one is to find any news related to the districts you live in on the internet. Secondly, to interview local residents in the town as they have been living in a particular area for a long time, they must have heard many myths as well as experienced some by themselves.

In this essay, I discuss the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house and suggest a way to reach materials about them. \n\nI believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research a house or building. The most important one is that these days, a number of people consider their own houses or buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansions by making a sale or purchasing them, which means that they believe that their houses could be an effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their houses or buildings as products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize the historical value of their building where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get interested in gaining plenty of stories which the property contains, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. \n\nWhen it comes to people who want to know about their own house, they could utilize many ways to get useful knowledge. The simplest strategy is that just questioning  elder family members, and neighbours living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is a also pretty efficient way for people to search for a copy of a house deed, which is a document specifying details of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of their house or building, they would get a range of materials from public officials or on the Internet. \n\nIn conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reason, they can take various steps to understand and appreciate their valuable and precious assets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In recent years, there has been a debate on whether the expense of fuel for cars and other vehicles should be raised in order to address environmental issues. Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.\n\nFirst of all, the act of increasing the price of vehicles\u2019 fuel in order to tackle environmental problems is generally ineffective and unwise. Even if the cost of gas were to experience considerable growth, it is unlikely that the demand for private vehicles will alleviate. One explanation can be given is that people have become over-reliant on private transportations. Most of them find it significantly more comfortable and convenient to travel by cars or motorbikes in comparison to using public transportations such as buses or trains. As such, the constant need for automobiles, as well as the hazardous environmental impacts originating from this demand, are still apparent despite the soaring gas prices.\n\nFurthermore, if the value of gas is remarkably elevated, there are a number of outcomes that are guaranteed to be financially unfavourable for the economy. It should be taken into consideration that fossil fuel is essential to many industries that provide necessary goods for people. So as a consequence, when the cost of fuel rises, the price of daily commodities will witness an increase as well. This phenomenon will directly produce a predicament for developing countries that are already in deficiency of goods such as food. When products' prices skyrocketed, the citizens from those countries will find themselves unable to afford daily items, leaving them to face incredible hardships and difficulties.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the view that elevating the cost of fuel is the most practical way to deal with environmental issues. This is due to the fact that not only this proposal proves to be inefficacious, but it also can be disastrous for poorer countries' economies and citizens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

At present, more and more individuals liking travel from one place to another place than last few decades. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon. I deem that travelling has enough of advantages for the holiday makers. I will discuss the certain reasons and some advantages of travelling in the below paragraphs.\n\nTo start with there are two major factors which help to explain ideas why travelling is becoming more popular than in the past time. First reason is that people know very well, in the before time people had less interest in travelling, as they most liked to earn the money for fulfilling the needs of their family members. Because of this they had to work hard around the clock. Owing to this circumstance, they had no time for travelling. However, now the trend of this has varied in many ways. Technology has become faster, convenient, easier with the advents of current features. Namely transportation, which saves the time of the people. Nevertheless, people love travelling. Secondly, it has become enjoyable for their travellers. To illustrate, even if a person working in a big company at present. He or she gets promotions from their companies in order to go one place to another place either seven or a month with family, which the way of the this is an affordable. On the contrary side, it is impossible last few decades. Due to, people tend to travel in their life.\n\nIn spite of the causes, there are more advantages of departing for the passengers. First and foremost benefit is that it helps to provide the opportunity to make new friends. For instance, when a person moves to another country in life. As a result, he or she meets new friends, who belong to other traditions. From those  people he gets a chance to see their culture, conventional items of their country, lifestyles, foods and many more. In addition to it, travellers get an opportunity to have a national identity of their country, where they are able to live for a long time as well as learn about languages, which helps to stay connected with other people. It uses to enhance the in depth of knowledge for the layman.\n\nTo sum up, even though moving one region to another region has more reasons, yet while travelling has been many advantages for the trippers.

This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.\n\tOn the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.\n\tOn the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.\n\tIn conclusion, although climate change can impact some drawbacks to the business, there are brighter sides that people can rely on to benefit their business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Housing, being a fundamental need for individuals, has sparked debates about whether the government should offer it freely for those who are economically disadvantaged. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment.\n\nI approve of the notion that free housing can lead to enhanced societal stability, which subsequently fosters national progress. In many societies, homelessness and housing insecurities plague the population, causing ripples of discontent and disenfranchisement. Ensuring everyone has shelter, a direct impact would be a reduction in street crimes, as desperation often drives people to unlawful acts. For instance, countries with robust social housing programs, like Denmark, report lower rates of vagrancy-related crimes. Additionally, a stable living situation can enhance individuals' mental and emotional well-being, leading to more productive and content citizens. As more people become productive, it contributes to the broader development and prosperity of a nation.\n\nI concur that providing free housing can also result in a boost to economic mobility, paving the way for a more equitable society. When people aren\u2019t burdened by exorbitant rents or the threat of eviction, they can allocate resources to education and skill development. This alignment of priorities leads to a more skilled workforce. For example, in nations where housing is heavily subsidized, such as in certain Nordic countries, there is a higher percentage of the population pursuing higher education and vocational training. As these individuals climb the socioeconomic ladder due to their enhanced skills, it reduces wealth disparities and fosters a more harmonious and balanced society. \n\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the proposition solely due to the potential strain on governmental budgets, eventually resulting in the potential neglect of other critical sectors. Allocating funds for universal free housing would undoubtedly divert financial investments in other sectors like healthcare, education, or infrastructure. For instance, countries that have attempted large-scale free housing projects, such as Venezuela, faced challenges in managing their budgets, leading to economic downturns. This financial strain can culminate in inadequate facilities, poorer healthcare systems, and compromised educational quality. The eventual outcome might be a society where housing is free, but other basic necessities and quality services become scarce or subpar.\n\nTo sum up, while the merits of offering free housing are significant in fostering societal and economic growth, it is paramount to weigh these benefits against the potential strains on a nation's resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. \nDiscuss both opinions and give your own opinion.\nEssay: In recent times, it's very important to recycle things like a plastic and glass and reduce the waste of it by teaching children. However, It's a highly debated topic, Some believe that it should be taught by schools and others think that it might be more effective if learn at home by parents. This essay will discuss both points of views further. I firmly believe that, Children should be aware and learn about this at the institution.\n\nOn the one hand, some group of people agrees that like other learnings, the value of recycled material and rubbish should teach at the house. In light of the fact that, Child always learns anything first at home to other places. For instance, one research held by the World Health Organisation in 1998 resulted, babies are adopting habits such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. From their parents and guardians while spending time with them. Therefore, they argue that home is a good place to learn about recycling things and waste.\n\nOn the other hand, I would stand by the former view that an institution is a more effective place for aware children to grasp habits of reuse the things. Firstly, It's well established fact that, students more listen to their teachers to parents. Secondly, They can learn from other peers by watching them. Last but not the least, If schools provide learning through practical examples, then children can more retain information for a long time. For example, One recent European study demonstrates that, Learning at school is far more impactful than home.\n\nTo conclude, People may vary in their opinion, I strongly believe that learning about reducing a waste and recycling a rubbish to children in schools are a more efficient way to home."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?\nEssay: It is believed by some that sending youngsters to single-sex schools can bring many disadvantages later in life. Meanwhile, many parents choose to send their offspring to these schools because they think that it is more beneficial to them. In my opinion, this can have many negatives. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.\n\nTo begin with, sending children to single-sex schools can make it hard for them to learn how to interact and cope with the opposite sex . To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that spending time with kids of the opposite sex is essential and can facilitate the development of youngsters' communication skills. Moreover, they can learn how to interact and be members of one group and work as a team. Therefore, sending offspring to a single-sex school can make it harder for them to cope with children from the opposite sex. \n\nLastly, if young boys go to a different school than young girls, then the quality of their social life in the future can be damaged. For instance, scholars reckon that when kids from both genders go to the same school and spend time together, they can learn about their differences and cope with them. As a consequence, they are more likely to have a successful marriage and it will be easier for them to find friends from the opposite sex when they are adults. This shows that there are many benefits to encouraging boys and girls to interact with each other. Thus, sending our offspring to schools that accept both genders will be more beneficial to them and their social lives. \n\nTo conclude, it is reckoned by some that sending kids to schools that accept only boys or girls can cause issues for them later in life. In my view, this statement is completely true. Given the current circumstances, it is best to encourage kids from both genders to interact with each other more often."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

What are the causes in your opinion for this? How is it affecting family life and the society as a whole?\nEssay: It is true that people have increasingly put in extra hours at work and therefore had little time for their families and friends in recent years. This essay will discuss the possible causes in my perspective for this growing trend and also suggests the possible consequences that may result in both personal life and  society.\n\nThere are several causes for people working harder and longer hours in today's world. First, since the world's population is still increasing in huge annual increments, at around 80 million per year, with scarce resources and opportunities, people are having to contend with each other harder than ever before, especially in densely populated areas. This means that if a person doesn't work diligently, he or she will be susceptible to unemployment and not be able to feed his or her family.Second, spending more time working can offer a number of benefits to workers in the company. For example, by leaning into a frenzy in the workplace, a worker can be viewed as productive or being sought after, creating a sense of status for him or her.\n\nConsequently, the trend can affect individuals and  society to a certain extent. Being overly concerned about work can impair other important aspects of life, including relationships with family members. For instance, some successful managers have divorced many times or have not been able to watch their children grow since they don't spend time with their families. In addition, spending too much time in the performance zone could give rise to various mental health problems, such as burnout or stress, leading to productivity loss as a result. Recent research and studies conducted have indicated that productivity decreases for employees who work more than fifty hours per week because of inadequate recovery time.\n\nIn short, I believe that overpopulation and self-recognition have caused employees to spend longer hours in the workplace and neglect family relationships. This may result in burnout and stress, leading to reduced productivity and spoiling family relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

For example: there is a lot of scientific paper to can prove this idea.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that children affect outside. Because, technology is advancing every day. For instance, kids are interested in the world of technology and they can do with smartphones, computer, internet and so on. Even, the watch cartoons on the YouTube instead TV.

No doubt that the power of control over informational recourse should be and depends on its spreading and influence on people. \n\nFirstly, there are many online forums, courses and conferences during which person can catch wrong ideas or be deceived by following the pieces of advice that dominate there.

What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?\nEssay: Many students these days find it increasingly difficult to pay attention during lessons. In my opinion, this is partly a natural reaction that has been exacerbater by technology and the solutions lie in school reform.\n\nStudents struggle to stay engaged both due to a natural predisposition and the pervasive impact of screen time. Students throughout history have always wanted to escape their school lessons. This is because learning is difficult and provides little pleasure itself relative to both passive and active pastimes like hanging out with friends, watching TV, listening to music, or playing sports. Moreover, the advent of the ubiquitous internet era and portable devices such as smartphones has had an exponential effect on attention spans and diversionary priorities. Most students today are addicted to short videos and posts on social media networks and therefore struggle to follow the intricate arguments of lengthy lectures and extended readings.\n\nOn a small scale, individuals can remedy these problems through sheer willpower but for broader change schools must play an active role. The most immediate fix would be to ban phones. This is difficult since phones serve practical purposes such as allowing students to call their parents or book a ride home, but they could be taken at the beginning of the day and returned when school finishes. Another step schools could take would be to modernise the curriculum and account for reduced attention spans. Lessons could be shorter and could include more interactivity in order to stimulate learning. rather than the passive learning environment that has led to daydreaming students for generations.\n\nIn conclusion, although this trend is likely an irreversible part of human nature and progress, schools can implement changes. to curb its effects.

While I agree that imposed dress codes are unnecessary and meaningless in many work areas, I believe that it should be still existed in some professions for good reason.\n\nOn the one hand, many employers stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see it as positive trends. Some of the most successful companies in the world, such as Google and Facebook, are famous for the relaxed working environments. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even company executives are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers can be free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce works of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and the success of such companies that strict codes are completely unnecessary in some sectors.\n\nHowever, I would also argue that employees' clothing is still important in some other work sectors. We expect certain professionals, such as nurses, officers, firemen, to wear uniforms. These uniforms have a practical or safety function, but most importantly, they identify the person's role in a society. Similarly, a lawyer, a politician, a teacher should choose to wear formal clothing in order to portray an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence.

Personally, I disagree with this opinion.\nWorking as a volunteer has become increasingly popular among teenagers. I agree that this can help them to fulfill their free time. On the other hand, studying is more important than doing unpaid work and most of them find it extremely hard as a compulsory studying. If individual teenagers had free time, they would do sports instead of doing unpaid work. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies. \nOn the other hand, those who think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work, they pressure on them and it can cause resentment amongst teenagers and society. Furthermore, I do not agree that society would benefit from unpaid work as a whole. To force young people to work as a volunteer could be counterproductive and parents would be dissatisfied how to rise their children. Encorcement on teenagers can gain nothing for the young and society. For example, recent survey on how enforcement can be devastating effect on children states that roughly over 50 percent of teenagers leave home to escape their parents' pressure.

Therefore, I will examine the consequences of this phenomenon and demonstrate potential measurements.\n\nIndubitably, there are several compelling results when individuals frequently use industrial products. Foremost, since almost all  modern items are made of chemicals, they take an enormous amount of time as well as effort to degrade naturally. In fact, thus plenty of waste are non-biodegradable stuff, which can threaten animal creatures in the ocean and ground.

This essay will argue why this has become so important and how such information can be collected.\n\nFirstly, as people have become more familiar with their country or town's history, it has been popular to get to know about the structure, the architecture and also the usage of the place in the past. Sometimes it belongs to a century ago. Furthermore, some buyers or renters are enthusiasts and curious about whom the house belonged to. It would be more interesting if a royal family used to inhabit there rather than an ordinary or middle-class one. Considering a building refers hundreds of years ago  if it has  survived during this period, it means that one can trust  how strong and reliable the structure is. For the second reason, it can be indicated that people belonging to a superstitious culture tend to not choose houses which are described as haunted ones.

Do you think the advantages of a greater difference in age between them outweigh the disadvantages?\nEssay: Yes, I am of the opinion that having a larger age difference between parents and their kids can be advantageous for better upbringing; as having more years on their side makes individuals mature and balanced. Firstly, this essay will discuss the advantages of this approach and then I will present to you my opinion on why the drawbacks hold little significance.\n\nI personally endorse that couples should plan to procreate when they are ready to shoulder the responsibility that parenthood entails. Most people nowadays rush into having children without possessing the know-how or requisite maturity to bring them up. Having a baby is a miracle of nature, however, nurturing your offspring and giving them the right care is of higher significance. Giving birth should be an informed decision and it should be taken when parents are self-aware of their emotional and financial strength to become primary caregivers to a little human. Children require love, care, time, resources and so much more; most young parents do not have the bandwidth to provide all of the above to their offspring. There are feelings of bitterness towards their children which leads to neglect and it is not the ideal situation any child should be put through. For instance, vast research exists on the fact wherein young parents have put their kids for adoption as they were unable to care for them.\n\nOn the other hand, several people argue that having an offspring when you are younger and agile is a greater experience for both the child and the parent. They feel that having age on their side, people will be more active and youthful; it is easier to give birth and also take responsibility for the kid. Even though this hypothesis might hold some truth, it cannot be ignored that there are several things required to bring up an infant in a wholesome manner. Just being able to run around with the infant is not reason enough to give birth when you are younger.\u00a0Parents need to be mentally prepared to give the next 20 years of their life to their children, a kid is not a toy to play with but an individual that will depend on you for a huge portion of his/her life. \n\nTo conclude, there is no thumb rule or directory to prove the merits of one over the other.

It is thought that giving stringent punishments to offenders would reduce accidents. In my opinion, I completely agree with that thought, because people commit mistakes as they are taking things as granted.\n\nFirstly, most of the accidents are happening because of negligence while driving. Particulary, in the developing countries, people does not obey the traffic rules as there are not much strict punishments for disobeying driving rules. Unlike developed countries, where they have technologies in place to identify persons breaking the traffic laws. For example, many advanced economic countires have AI based camera at signals to capture photographs of cars that violates red signal and they would be punished at later point with the evidence captured. However, to implement these technologies in developing and under developing countires would be a huge problem as it inccur massive costs.\n\nSecondly, this is all about people mindset. For example, many countires have high degree of punishments for serious crimes and people will not dare to commit those crimes. Whereas, when it comes to driving offenses, it is not taken so seriously and also the penalty charges imposed are also very low. Hence, people will not take these laws very seriously. On the other hand, creating awareness by including traffic/driving laws in school subjects and campaign the effects of breaking laws would help but thats for the longer term as it would take time to see the results.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, relatively harsh punishments and more fines are required to bring down the driving offenses so that people take these laws more seriously and adopt it.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. This essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.\nTo commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. As children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. Furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. For instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. Thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.\nAdditionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. As a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. For example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.\nOn the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. Addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. If a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. There are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.\nMoreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. Nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. Using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.\nTo conclude, it is proven that outdoor activities are more beneficial than playing computer games. Therefore, communities, parents, and teachers ought to encourage children to do outdoor activities rather than ordering a child be sitted for a long time, the act which causes unhealthiness."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers.

What extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Road safety is a very important and concerning matter. Carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. Therefore, the only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. According to my perspective, I completely agree with administering severe penance for any kind of recklessness or irresponsibility on streets as any mistake can cause someone losing his or her life. In the essay, I will discuss the reason that lead to accidents and why severe penalizing is necessary for such a delinquency.\n\n Firstly, punctuality is a major reason for mishaps on the streets. To put it more simply, people speed on the highways and break traffic rules when they are getting late to reach their destination. To illustrate, suppose a man needs to reach work by 8 but he started off late from home. So now to get to office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control. He might injure himself badly or even worse die.\n\n Secondly, drunk driving also originates tragedies on highways. Often youngsters drink and drive which results in them losing control and crashing into something else. It is very concerning as it can severely injure someone or even worse take someone's life. Likewise, teenagers speed on the streets as being part of a racing competition or just for fun or adventure which is unacceptable because all of this promotes mishaps.\n\n To conclude, folks have a very casual attitude towards traffic laws. They are more prone to breaking them despite the fact that it can save their lives.

Also, owing to the advent of mobile applications like WeChat and Line, the heartfelt letters that we used to write to our near and dear ones have become extinct. Though there are both advantages and disadvantages to this development, I believe it is more beneficial than harmful. \n\nThe first and straightforward advantage is the reduced use of printed materials. Consequently, fewer trees are cut down for paper making, imposing less pressure on the environment. Secondly, the internet makes news available to the public sooner than any conventional print media. Thirdly, social media has become the most effective means of communication. People from all over the world can come together over WeChat or Zoom without having to spend much money. It used to be very difficult for us in foreign countries or even in other cities to attend familial gatherings and ceremonies. Nowadays, thanks to technology, we could stay connected no matter how far we are from each other. \n\nHowever, when there are merits, disadvantages are also bound to be there. One major demerit is that electric gadgets are so addictive that human beings no longer know how to live without their smartphones.

However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important.

For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there.

While some people believe that entering a university or college will guarantee a successful career in the future, others state that working right after school is a better option. This essay will discuss these two opinions.\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why many people think that taking part in the labour market soon is more pivotal. One reason is that there are numerous poor students, who could hardly afford their tuition fees since they have to make ends meet for a living and therefore working straight after school is the best way to help them economically independent. The sooner they work, the more money they will earn. As a result, they might easily support their own families and personal lives. Another undeniable benefit is that young workers can gain considerable maturity. This is because working at this early stage of age would allow young employees to obtain a lot of real experiences from working environment. Thus, they are more likely to be more mature and responsible for their lives.\nOn the other hand, getting a higher education can bring some advantages. Firstly, it could give students countless opportunities to become qualified employees thanks to the academic knowledge and professional skills taught in a university or college. For example, having a doctorate would be an obvious benefit that university graduates have. This is because the hospital requires applicants with specific knowledge and relevant skill set which could hardly be learned if ones did not attend educational institutions. Furthermore, taking an education course will give students time to consider the most suitable job for themselves in the future. Studying at a university will not only can individuals get more chances to achieve significant remuneration after graduation, but the more time to discover their potential job.\nIn conclusion, working right after school could bring a great number of benefits.

This has become a controversial issue. From my point of view, I am disagreed with this idea and reckon it should not be made legal. The reasons for my argument will be explained further in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached.\n\nAt present, there are some segments of society who think that it is a necessary job for descendants to take care of the elderly when they become physically and mentally weak. However, I strongly disagree with this, not with the fact that pupils take care of elders but with the belief that it should be made legal. I always think that it is a good deed for youth to look after their family members, but this should be an optional choice. Everyone has their own right to choose whether they want or do not want to do something. \n\nFurthermore, it is found by one of the surveys that some people, including young ages, are not ready to hold others' lives in their hands because they are still struggling with their own lives. For instance, think about a person who works all day and night but is still surrounded by problems such as financial, working, and educational issues. Therefore, it would be best for these people to look after their family members when they are ready or it would give them more burden.\n\nIn conclusion, even though some populations believe that the younger members of the family should be legally responsible for the elderly, I disagree with this and think that everyone must have the right to choose.

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, i would argue that it is better to go college or university\n  The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, learning skills which are necessary for your future career such as team working,problems solving,etc could be a good chance to be well-prepared and get a well-paid job. For example, applicants who have a real experiences which are only gained from working will be more impressive with employer in interviews.

This essay will discuss the opinions from both sides and give my own opinion.\n\nPeople agreed that it is not helpful to children's growth if those youngsters bear more responsibilities with several reasons. Firstly, too much responsibility which could depress younger generation by taking many tasks, could destroy their childhood. For example, in many families, many kids about merely seven or eight years old already do houseworks so that they don't have time to enjoy quality time with their friends. Secondly, due to the occupation of time from those houseworks responsibilities, students show the incapable of studying missions.

Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people\u2019s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families.

In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. \n\nThere are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizens.

People believe that they should first focus on their career and after being successful, they will plan regarding family life. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.\n\nTo begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.\n\nThough  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. \n\nSo, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

Some people think that newspapers are the best way to learn news. However, others believe that they can learn news better through other media. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\nEssay: News keep us informed by reporting ongoing issues. Therefore, some people claim that newspapers are the best form of media, while others are sceptical about this statement and opine that news can be more effectively acquired from other media. Both parties have their reasonable points which I shall analyse in this essay, along with my own perspective.\nOn the one hand, newspapers are highly appreciated thanks to its reliability. The first supportive reason is that newspapers are written by fully-trained journalists from prestigious publishers, as well as professionals from various fields. Therefore, it is irrefutable that news articles are of high authenticity and are usually highly academic. The second beneficial feature contributing to reliability is that it is imposed on strict censorship by the government or local authorities which is essential to control misleading or triggering information, especially with regard to politic issues. For example, trusty governmental newspapers have been reporting about COVID-19 pandemic, whose information is considered accurate, concise and neutral.\nOn the other hand, various other forms of media such as websites, or social media have a merit of quick updating. Unlike traditional newspapers which takes a vast amount of time for editing, printing before it can reach the hands of its readers, the news on websites are updated second by second so it can readily transfer the information to clients instantaneously. Likewise, news on social media are also updated rapidly thanks to the contribution of a massive community all over the globe. However, there is a demerit that these different media may contain misleading news, which is rife among the Internet these days.\nTo conclude, professional newspapers and journalists are more reliable, but the Internet is far faster in terms of updating. In my opinion, high authenticity is the most important factor, so the newspaper will continue to play a pivotal role to readers. Whereas, other media forms offer alternatives for those who prefer instant news."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

I firmly stand with those who hold the former view.\n\nAdmittedly, a significant amount of publications apply good-looking models to endorse their products, resulting in people doubting their own appearances, even though most of the time, those fabulous pictures are photoshopped. Furthermore, some companies associate their brands and products with higher social status and persuade customers to buy items that they do not need, but only serve as implicating their social ladder and fortunes, which leads to plenty of individuals seeking helps from loan to pay for their unnecessary and endless debts.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\nEssay: In today's time, human activities are having an extreme effect on climate change of our planet and some people think that rather than taking measure's to prevent humidity change, we should learn to live with it. I firmly disagree with this opinion, and in this essay, I will provide a certain example's to back my argument.\n\nThese days, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at there highest levels since the past thousand's of years. This has caused many problems. For instance, people who live in polluted cities have difficulty in breathing, low fertility rate, lower life expectancy among infants and much more. All this combined with global warming and man-made pollution has made it extremely difficult for nature to maintain it's rest configuration. All this has caused drastic changes to occur in our planet's climate, which can also cause many natural habitats to go extinct. Under such circumstances, only us humans will be able to adapt to the temperature changes, but not other species.\n\nFor example, consider the case of fishes. The continuous increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the vapourisation of polar ice caps. This has lead to an increase in  sea levels around the world. In such circumstances, the amount of human waste deposition into the sea and oceans around the world has also increased which has led to the deaths of countless fishes in these waters. Moreover, in some instances, these fishes were found to be dead on the shore of beaches and some found to be floating dead on the surface of the water. This is just one of the few examples that go on to show, that although humans will be able to adapt to all the temperature changes and find a way to live with these changes, majority of the animal kingdom population won't be able to do the same.\n\nSo in a nutshell, instead of finding a way to live with the changing temperature, one should look for ways to minimize it. By doing so, we won't only be saving our own natural habitat, but we will also be creating a more stable and livable environment for the future generation's to come."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: A certain number of individuals feel that the only way the government can successfully tackle the rate of famine and poverty is by improving the growth of the economy, on the other hand others believe this growth is having a detrimental effect in the society and as a result should be shut down. In my opinion, despite the harmful effects of economic growth, I believe that growing the economy by building infrastructures will create jobs which will end the problems.\n\nTo begin with, one of the main causes of why people are poor and cannot afford daily meals is because they are unemployed. If the government should focus more energy and money into the development of infrastructures such as the building of hospitals, airports, train stations and sanitary systems, these will create thousands of jobs for people, thus ending the hungry strike and poverty among their citizens. For instance, Togo that was previously one of the poorest countries in the world, with 30 % of its population living in poverty, is now the second blooming economy in Africa after their new president invested the 1 trillion dollars they borrowed from the World Bank into infrastructure.\n\nHowever, other people feel that the ill effects of economic growth should not be over looked particularly in regards to pollution and overpopulation that might result from this growth. They are of the opinion that people will tend to move to areas where infrastructures are being built which will lead to more diseases from being overpopulated. Additionally, they are concerned that the crime rate will also go on in areas like train stations and airport at night because of the lack of sophisticated police force. In my opinion, I disagree with this notion as there have been examples of countries that have undergone rapid development without problems such as air pollution, overpopulation and increase in criminal activity.  \n\nTo conclude, quite a decent number of people believe the key to eradicating poverty is for the government to develop the economy, while others are more worried  about the drawbacks associated with economic growth and should therefore be stopped. In my candid opinion, I agree with the notion that an improvement in the economy is the most effective way to end poverty, moreover a better planning prior to the development of the economy will negate any possible drawback."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Society feels that the best way to tackle this problem is to increase the cost of fuel. However, I feel that is not the only way to relieve this planet of this problem. I will substantiate my reasoning in the course of this essay.\n\n\tFirst and foremost, increasing fuel costs will create a change in the transportation sector. Many people will choose to take alternate mediums of transport. They will be encouraged to carpool, use public transport and even in the case of short-distance travel, walk or use a bicycle. However, there is still no guarantee for this. For example, in my hometown Trivandrum, the price is currently INR. 104/- per litre, and keeps rising every week. Considering, that travel by car and bike is the easiest mode of transportation because of the distance between the different requirements in the city, and the lack of a reliable public transport system, individuals are still forced to rely on their cars to move from place to place.\n\n\tAlternately, what the government needs to do, is to strengthen the public transport sectors, impose heavy fines on the number of vehicles a family can posse, and in addition, they must thrust onto the public fines for using vehicles after a certain hour. Furthermore, they should encourage local bicycle businesses, by creating more bicycle lanes and parks, which will in turn help to boost their business. Car manufacturers, must look into the possibility of producing greener cars, and slowly phase out the production of petrol and diesel vehicles. Once this happens, more and more petrol stations will cater to the new requirements by vehicle owners. These are some of the changes that the administration can enforce.\n\n\tIn conclusion, I believe the increase in fuel price is not the only answer for this problem, but in fact, the government has to invest heavily in renewable forms of energy if any sustainable and lasting change needs to be made."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

While one section of the society consider this as an opportunity for creating and expanding businesses, others see this as a drawback for them. This essay will juxtapose both these views, and finally conclude with my opinion.\n\nWith the dramatic change in the weather patterns, the tourism industry has been harshly hit. Owing to unexpected rise and fall in temperatures in most of the parts of the world, such as extreme weather conditions in India, where summers are as warm as 50 degrees Celsius and in winters mercury level drops to nearly freezing 0 degrees Celsius, tourists do not prefer to visit such places. Consequently, local businesses and overall economy dependent on tourism gets detrimentally affected.\n\nOn the contrary, few businesses such as air conditioner manufactures, fans and heaters manufacturing companies see this as a good time to boost their business as the demand of their products shoot up due to climatic change and consequently they have to increase the supply as well. Their agenda becomes very clear and their business potentially increases in such conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, though few businesses gain from the climate change, I believe the majority has a perilous effect on them.

Therefore, a school of thought holds that students should criticize or make a complaint to their teachers or tutors while some claim that it will lead to a loss of respect in the classroom. From my perspective, I firmly lean towards the first idea and this essay will discuss these two viewpoints in a depth.\n\nNowadays, there is no denying that in some countries, the educational quality is significantly declined.  On the one hand, in terms of the governments, they concentrate on developing the economy rather than educational quality which leads to the dissatisfaction of students in schools or even parents. Hence, whenever students do not feel satisfied with what they are learning or the teacher's attitudes towards them, they should make a complaint so that the teachers would improve it. Besides, everything is not perfect, thus, this criticism might create a motivation for the schools to tackle these problems.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that it is disrespectful when students make a criticism on their teachers. To begin with, open discussion between the teachers and the students can be a viable solution. For instance, they can both discuss the problems, expressing their own opinions so that eventually come up with the solution. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become proactive in studying. Furthermore, teachers might have a chance to better their pedagogical skills.

This discussion is my opinion that proves a private institution has not had any negative side as many of the people considering. \n\nIndeed, public secondary schools are very limited in every country. The Government can not establish a public school in  all villages or localities. This can be because of its economic liability or may be due to some other reasons. For example, a poor economy with below average income cannot invest to operate a public institution in each village. Hence every pupil will not get benefited. \n\nHowever, a private party who has the capability to establish and operate an educational institution are always helpful. They could successfully run an educational institution with necessary permissions from the ruling Government, in order to maintain the quality as per the requirements of the country's educational system. For example, obviously a private school can provide with more facilities, according to the need of every student. This way a private school cannot have a negative effect.

To solve this problem, some people suggested increasing the price of fuels. In my opinion, this measure is ineffective to tackle the environment pollution and there are more suitable solutions to this problem\nFirstly, increasing the cost of fuels can\u2019t decrease the usage of it. The world\u2019s transport system depends heavily on fossil fuels to run, so a higher price for diesel oil and gas won\u2019t decrease the need of it. The toxic chemicals emission will remain the same, and the environment situation won\u2019t get any better. For example, our government has increased the price of oil and gas significantly over the last decade, but because of the popularity of private vehicles in our country, the sales of these two types of energy has not decrease.\nWhen it comes to tackle the environment pollution, there are more practical solutions than increasing the price of fuels. Firstly, we can shift our use of fossil fuels to a more eco-friendly alternative. Electric and sun-energy are two possible source of energy that can replace oil and gas. They are more sustainable, less expensive and don\u2019t harm the nature. If these sources of energy get more popular, it can have a positive effect on tackling the environment pollution.

There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month\u2019s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family\u2019s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family\u2019s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property\u2019s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference.

Some argued that staff should have a rest for a month every year, although this leads to some positive impacts, but I completely disagree about this statement.\n\nIt is true that the prolonging holidays have some advantages. First, since this tendency will provide personnel with more time to release stress after a long period of working, such as travelling or participating in recreational activities. For instance, the employees would adjust themselves to work after a rest and eventually improve their work efficiency. Secondly, if the employees have more time to take care of their babies, they would be more willing to devote their energy to their working processes, In fact, if the staff have the life satisfaction, they would only focus on careers, which is a conducive environment for the corporations' development to increase\n\nOn the other hand, the policy of extending holidays will also lead to some drawbacks, which can put  the business of the companies at stake.  By the time the holiday ends, the employees' mental and physical abilities become passive since it took them a long date without exposing to their regular tasks such as typing a report or conducting a research. As a result, this leads to the fact that the capacity in the working environment is not effective and affect badly the company's achievement.

This has immediately been an issue for many countries. This problem has its sources as well as ideas to remedy it.\n\nTo begin with, a significant percentage of the population around the world have their own vehicle. Each family has at least one or two cars. These people benefit from it as a mode of transport to commute to their destinations such as workplace, shopping mall or at their relative's place. Few of them would go by bus or take the metro. They find it easier and more comfortable to travel in their own car.

Now, in some countries,  road development is quite poor. The street is sometimes narrow or has cracks.

They should be encouraged to travel by bus rather than using the car more often. The government could take initiatives like lowering the bus fare or increasing the frequency of buses on the road. A sustainable idea could be offering each family a bicycle motivating them to consider other means of transport.

If at any point the rules are not followed, a yellow or red card would be given. This shows that there are consequences if restrictions are not abided by. The children would be learning about teamwork, communication and cooperation while simultaneously having fun.\n\nTeam sports are beneficial when it comes to teaching the younger generation. It is a great educational tool that provides life skills, fitness and fun times all at once.

Some people think a solution can be to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Nowadays, there is a significant increase in the number of people turning seriously overweight. Some people believe that a possible solution for this issue is to increase the price of fattening foods. From my point of view, I firmly disagree with this solution due to the fact that this is not efficient and can lead to malnutrition.\n\n First of all, if we increase the price of fattening food, it will be harder for people with low income access to food sources. Due to the fact that low-income people do not have enough money to cook meals for themselves, while fattening food now sells at an affordable price. For instance, to cook a meal we need to provide other fees such as electric and water bills which make the cost a lot more expensive compared to fast food. In addition, this solution just can reduce a small proportion of people who consume fattening food. That also means that not only food which contains fat makes people overweight but food that provides a large amount of carbohydrate is also a big contributor to obesity.\n\n In contrast, instead of increasing the price of fattening food, the governments should raise the residents' awareness about the drawbacks of fattening food such as fast food by propagandizing the information on television or social networks such as Facebook or TikTok.\n\n In conclusion, we should not extend the fattening food price because it is not efficient and can make it hard for people with low income to access food sources. Instead, we can raise people's awareness through social media."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

From my perspective, people want to be aware of previous tenants in order to understand the ambiance of the walls. \n\nTo begin with, people often have a curiosity about buildings, especially old ones. It is widely believed that houses in which someone prominent has lived are special places with a strong atmosphere. Moreover, some nations have profound beliefs about the magic effect that can houses make on tenants.

Young people mostly unaware of communal problems so if they enrolled themselves for free social work then they will realise the gravity of particular problem and also could be able to provide a piece of advice. For instance, I worked for the NGO from Pune, India formed by college-going students and took volunteer participation in clean Narmada river program. Thus, as per my experience, I feel that to develop adolescents\u2019 likings in community work, people should encourage them.\nFurthermore, spending free time in engaging communal activities would develop teenager's interest in politics, social work, and public sector services. The reason for this is, nowadays, most of the children spend their spare time by watching some TV programs or by playing computer games. If they start investing that time doing community tasks, they might start thinking to become a politician or a social worker or a public service agent to help community grow faster.

In my opinion, yes money is the most important factor for many people to stay in the workforce.\n\nThe working personnel is the backbone of any nation or company, the smooth working of the organization depends on the wellness and contentment of the labour pool. There are various reasons that motivate the public to work in an industry some of the reasons can be the security of getting a paycheck at the end of every month which is unlikely if you own a business or work as a freelancer, business owners can bare a loss in their business which many people are not ready to accept. Having a regular salary paid monthly gives the common man a sense of stability and safety in their life. While money is the critical aspect for being a part of the labour pool many people are programmed from their childhood to get a degree and secure a good paying job in a reputed company, the idea of staring a business or a startup is generally frowned upon because of the instability and persistence it requires to establish and run a successful business.\n\nWhat we conclude from this is that money plays a crucial role for the public to join the workforce many people are ready to work under someone and have a secure job with constant flow of money with a stable life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

I   believe, each company or business has to play their part in improving the lives of people and environment. They should strongly follow the best practices which will benefit the world around us and   its living beings.  Businesses has to ensure that their products are not affecting consumers health or causing negative side   effects in long or short term. For example, if a company is selling sugary drinks, then the ingredients and   the amount of the sugar should be clearly mentioned on the packing. It's their responsibility that the   end user is aware of the negative side effect it can cause to the health. Companies can also run   awareness ad campaigns on television or radio to teach people about the positive of health benefits due   to less sugar consumption though it can decline their profit.  Another example of \"social responsible\" practice can be towards environment. Using re-cyclable   materials to build or pack an item can be expensive for a company. However, if they are not using   environment friendly manufacturing material, it can be harmful for the climate or even endangered life   of animals. We have seen such incidents multiple times and there was even a massive awareness   campaign by World Wildlife Federation (WWF).

On one side, parents encourage their children to gain confidence by working on small jobs like waiters and accountants. On the other hand, most parents stop their children, especially girl child, from taking up different opportunities at this very young age.\n\nFirstly, living life differently helps young individuals to gain confidence and practical knowledge, which will help them excel in their adulthood. Additionally, it will develop their social and communication skills in turn opening up a bright future. This would help them acquire time management skills as well. For instance, a survey conducted illustrates that most students gain confidence to attend interviews, mostly by doing jobs at their early ages.\n\nSecondly, opposing this is mainly seen by, either rich parents or those who have a girl child. Wealthy parents spend their money, curbing children to satisfy their needs, preventing children from understanding the value of money.

It is true that, in some scenarios, we can see that some great leaders born with their inborn capabilities and they  have risen to greater success in their life either in their younger ages or in their later lives. When reviewing their entire journeys its clear that, they had passed with so much difficulty either it can be the financially or  the education or with their family matters. However, at their end of their journeys they became so succeed in their lives with the greater social image. Whether they can be entrepreneurs or businessmen or politicians they risen to the highest positions with their greater leadership skills.

To become a greater leader, it's necessary to have many skills for an individual, such as communication skills, decision making skills, organising skills, time management and the never give up.

However, people believe that the education system still need to develop. Many people dispute that high schools should provoke their students to raising questions and giving remarks to their teachers. Whereas, there are some who have different views about this. They think allowing students to criticize their teachers will cause a decline of respect and discipline in the classes. The arguments on both sides of this controversial issue will be discussed in the following paragraphs in turn, and finally, my opinion will be given.\n\nOn the one hand, some opponents are quick to point out that there are various reasons to consider getting advantages of permitting students to ask and conduct criticizing. Before all else, asking questions makes more benefits in a children's development. The more questions they ask, the more knowledges they get. In order to improve the educational quality, the learners should be learnt mentally and physically, and the teaching methods also should be perfect. Moreover, teachers also need to be fully qualified to avoid negative incidents between students and teachers. For example, the government should implement a suitable skill assessment to a teacher before appointing them, such as checking whether they are patient and creative minded or not.\n\nOn the other hand, other proponents have also expressed an equal view that there are several drawbacks of this issue regarding the respect and the discipline. First of all, mutual respect plays a pivotal role in a relationship among learners and their masters. If someone makes a question in the way of silly and rude, the person who has been asked will feel devastating and negative sentiment. In fact, it is really annoying if someone takes advantage of the permit to ask questions to the teachers. To avoid this situation becoming any worse, parents should teach their kids about manners, personalities, and how to show respect to their teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are some disadvantages and weakness, I passionately believe that the benefits will outshine the disadvantages by letting the students to asking question and giving critical comments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Besides their basic school work, they must not be pressurised with additional work which may affect them mentally.

Although there is no unified verdict on wheter it is beneficial or disadvantagtous to children today, I think, students being in same-gander schools may have difficulties later in life. In this essay I will explain my opinion.\n\n      Some parents believe that by eliminating the distractions it becomes easier to retain the knowledge that teachers offer. That is why they do not want their children to be in co-educational schools, because, espesially at pubert period, students of the opossite sex can be a distraction. In addition, these students tend to not feel the preassures of gender roles and learn to pursue areas that interested them no matter what is considered socially acceptable for their biological sex.

There is an expectation for everyone to work together.\n\n   From my point of view,  the school environment is a place where young generation learns what life will be like when thay enter the the real world.

For example, AI robots are able to reach the places where human can not reach and conduct scientific researches or bring samples from deep down in the ocean or the core of the earth for further researching purpose. From this perspective, robots are contributing to human's future development. What's more, robots can also liberate people from mediocre jobs such as waitering and waitressing or delivery services. With robots doing this repeated job, people can spend more efforts on exploring outerspace or other fun activities. Therefore, robots exert an positive effect on human's life.\n\nHowever, negativities or sides effects may also come with what we call \"the digital revolution era\". Since robots are able to replace jobs that are repetitive, the job market may suffer from fluctuation. For instance, given the fact that jobs are taken by robots, people who lack specific skills are hard to find their places in the society. Therefore, it is hard for them to secure a job. Despite the fact that some robots have the ability to take care of infants, those who are raised by these machines could find it hard to interact with people as robots can provide necessary care and nutrition for babies, love and company are more precious for infants.

Some critics state that the primary focus of the government should be reducing pollution of the environment and developing accommodation facilities as a preventive measure against sickness and disease. In this essay, I will discuss how declining the level of environmental pollution and improving living conditions endorse good health in a person.\n\nFirstly, the reduction of pollutants in the environment directly affects an individual\u2019s health. When water pollution is significantly reduced, the community will have access to water resources which are free of toxins. Furthermore, their level of exposure to hazardous substances is greatly reduced. This is exemplified by the trials done in Sweden where they calculated the relationship between mercury particles in the rivers of a city and the number of patients reported with Alzheimer\u2019s within a decade. They found that for every 0.2% increase in  mercury levels, there was a 3% rise in the number of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. \n\nSecondly, when proper housing with well-developed utilities is provided to the population there will be a decline in community-acquired diseases. For example, through various research, it is found that most patients diagnosed with Cholera were from underprivileged communities who lived in houses with very low standards of hygienic measures.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: People believe that there is no correlation between individuals\u2019 lives and news, then there should be no need to spend time on the newspaper and television. While it is true that some articles are not related to daily life to some extent, I would argue the necessity to update knowledge on every kind of media.\n\n\nTo begin with, there are several reasons for the disconnection between news and people. First, there are massive advertisements, which are not served and reflected in what individuals live and behave. This can be seen in promotion campaigns of some commercial companies, they attempted to appeal to people\u2019s attraction to their products by showing something against norms of society and irrelevant to its function, with this work for revenue only. Second, some data on newspaper and television programs couldn\u2019t contribute to the development of the country. For instance, many entertainment programs has been appeared on channels such as Vietnam Got Talent, The Voice and so on, which made up a huge time of young people\u2019s interaction and have no meaning for their knowledge and abilities.\n\n\nHowever, I believe that we should spare some time to get information from these intermediaries. Firstly, a great amount of domestic and international events are frequently announced on national television channels or national portals, which help people update the current issues and know how to prevent it when it occurs. For example, when N-COVID 19 epidemic exploded, Vietnam actively propagandized solutions to its citizens on protecting their own health and  ways of disease prevention. Secondly, individuals having a habit of reading daily news will broaden their knowledge and support for their disciplines. For instance, there is much news of a recent situation of the worldwide economy, such as supply and demand of products, foreign trade, exchange rate and vice versa for economics students to apply the real practice to their lessons.\n\n\nIn conclusion, some bulletins broadcasted are not correspondent to human activities, which couldn\u2019t be beneficial to improve people's lives.

Others think has negative social effects because individuals are not satisfied with what they are and what they have. discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: No one can deny the fact that advertising, whether commercial or public, changes individuals and societies. The changes brought about by advertising, in my opinion, are generally more negative than positive.\n\nA positive change is the growth of the economy, as advertising, the most common way for companies to convey information to customers, always brainwashes the audience to promote and encourage consumption. For example, many female consumers in China are exposed to various clothing advertisements on the internet every day and then buy in large quantities through online shopping software. This means that garment manufacturers will keep their production lines running 24 hours a day to meet the growing demands of customers, resulting in higher profits.\n\nHowever, advertising is the culprit in promoting a luxury lifestyle by creating excess demand, regardless of the potential negative impact on the community. Ordinary people tend to buy things that others have that they don't, because of the psychology of comparison. Even though they don't really need these things, they may still be tempted by elaborate advertising to waste money on them. In extreme cases, they will take loans from banks to satisfy their desires. Worryingly, this includes our next generation too. Young children are tempted by all kinds of beautiful objects, with immature money views. It is difficult for them not to spend money on these things, and when they have it, they will show it to others, which leads to a vicious circle.\n\nUnfortunately, in this day and age, our will to resist temptation is often defeated by our growing desires.

I am going to scrutinize both aspects in further paragraphs before forming an opinion in the last.\n\nTo begin with, on the one side of the coin, there are many reasons for supporting other important subjects in children\u2019s school curriculum; firstly, modern technology like computer literacy has become the need of the hour.  It is one of the most demanded skills for a job in every sector.  If they spend most of their time learning art they will not be able to face the cut-throat competition in this scenario. Moreover, the knowledge of essential subjects like math, and science is highly required in every field. Secondly, Art despite being highly appreciated, still does not ensure any career growth because most fields like engineering, marketing, IT professionals, and managers are found graduated and post graduated in these important subjects.\n\nOn the other flip side of the coin, art is a creative skill that has wonderful imagination power. It provides the wings to the fantasy and expresses the feelings without the exchange of words. To illustrate, I have come across a painting in which the difference between the rich and poor\u2019s plight was depicted through painting only. Moreover, music is also a piece of art and works as a healing therapy in the hectic world.

Some people believe that eventually this technology will be used to develop robots which will replace all human jobs. I disagree with this statement, and will explain my viewpoint in this forthcoming paragraph in detail.\n\nFirstly, to define artificial intelligence, it's a technology which replaces the human intelligence with a machine learned programmatic language. Technically speaking each and every job that is done by a human being could be converted to a programmable command and learnt by a machine to perform. To exemplify, self driving cars developed by Tesla are considered as robots. With several years of learning experiences and proper logic, the cars are programmed to drive safely. Having these kind of technological advancements, we can say a majority of the human jobs can be performed by robots.\n\nHowever, the human brain has tremendous intelligence power with several emotional quotients which cannot be fully replaced by artificially intelligent robots. Furthermore, cognitive ability that a human mind possesses can only sense the importance and criticality of the job and take a wise decision. For instance, a Psychiatric Doctor will be able to understand the mental situation of a patient with relevant questions and the most authentic response received from patients.\n\nTo summarize, artificial intelligent robots might replace a majority of jobs going forward.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\nEssay: For the past decades,traffic jam has been one of the issues that many countries are often facing. From my standpoint, there two major causes of these problems are transportation is getting more affordable and we are currently working in a mobile society.Therefore, the main point of this essay is to discuss these troubles to the solution.\n\nTo begin with,for the last 30 years, transportation such as cars and motorbikes are rated as luxury items. However,as the world develops with a growth in GDP and more new car industrials are being introduced hence quite a people nowadays are managed to afford a car or even more. Moreover, it is convenient for people to travel by cars or motorbikes because of its saving time and energy also comfortable feeling. Hence, the pavement is filled up with numerous kinds of moving thus leads to  plenty of logjam cases, as a result, people will get frustrated and suffered from waiting in order to continue on their journey. Yet,this troublesome complication can be tackled by encouraging citizens to travel by bus or MRT to eliminate the bottleneck as well as the number of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide for instance.\n\nOn the other hand, another reason for transportation has become prominent is the ambulatory of labouring. For example,a commercial business company is presumably to locate at the centre of a city so it is understandable for pupils to have an excursion from home to office.Nonetheless, since the culture of working time has a lot in similarity hence at some peak periods, countless folk have been sailing at the same moment, as a result,as a result, this position precipitating a chaotic movement along the highway.A solution to this concern is to have a diversity of running time for each district in a state,in that event, a strong reduction is expected to obtain for the sake of well-organised traffic.\n\nIn conclusion,these informative details are to indicate the main leads to  concerns.Although they   are feasible to deal with,still ,the best prevention to this trouble is  indeed one's awareness because even governments are endeavoured to convince them to drive civilly ,there are some individual can be reckless on their driving and attended to a snarl-up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Some folks argue that increasing the oil price is not the best solution to mitigate the environmental issue.  I on the other hand agree with the notion above that increasing the cost of petrol decreases the frequency of its usage thus contributing to environmental advantage. \n\nFirstly, increasing the costs of fuel is one way to combat pollution. This is because, by inflating fuel prices, people will hesitate to spend their money on gas when they can spend their money elsewhere. For example, in Australia, people will not fill the tank of their vehicles on any other day other than Tuesday as the price of petrol is highly expensive. They need to fill up their vehicle with petrol, but are forced to wait until Tuesday just to fill up their vehicle tank when the petrol price is relatively cheaper. Moreover, they will start exploring other modes of transportation such as buses and trains since the fares are cheaper than their spending on petrol.  \n\nSecondly, increasing the costs of fuel will directly affect the demand for fuel-based cars on the market. As a result of the rise in oil prices, there is less demand on the market for a vehicle that operates on petrol and diesel. It will further encourage people to explore other transportation that uses alternative energy for example electric or hybrid vehicles. For instance, a big brand like Toyota has started to produce more hybrid and electric automobiles as there is more demand for these types of vehicles in the market from consumers. \n\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with the statement above as increasing fuel will be beneficial towards the environment since it will encourage the community to be vigilant in their fuel spending and  forced to consider alternative options such as using vehicles that source from renewable energy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Firstly, they are interested in getting to know with families who had lived in their place before. more precisely, some people live in their ancestor's houses. in this case, they want to know about the mindset of their forefathers. for instance, the size of various parts of a house such as kitchen or dining room may show the importance of different aspects of their grand families.

This trend can be attributed to several key reasons and I believe that it can be both benefical and detrimental for those who wish to study their family history.\n\nOne of the main factors contributing to the commonality of this tendency is the potential reinforcement for better health choices. By delving deeping into their ancestor's history, people can uncover the information about genetically inherited health problems, allowing them to be more aware of their own risks. Armed with this knowledge, they can make informed decisions and adopt specific lifestyle changes to mitigate these problems. Additionally, researching family history can lead to the discovery of long-lost relatives caused by geographical barriers or consequences of wars. To illustrate, DNA databases, such as Bionet, have facilitated the reunion of millions of Vietnamese refugees as users can compare genetic information and trace their family tree online.\n\nNevertheless, there are both benefits and drawbacks to this approach. On the positive side, this study allows individuals to develop a family medical history, from which they might take action to mitigate the effects of hereditary diseases. If they did not find out their ancestor history, the would not know which diseases would arise and in some worst-case scenarios, it is too late for any treatment. In contrast, it is an incredibly time-consuming endeavour. Researchers are required to collect and analyze intentsive data on their family relationships and records which can be quite challenging in the modern life where people are object subjected by a hectic schedule. For instance, a friend of mine, who lost her father in 1975 spent about a decade searching for their siblings living in the U.S. This exemplifies the amount of time required in such a study.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend to research family history has emerged due to a desire for better health choices and enhanced connections with relatives. While this approach allows people to develop a family medical history which is useful for disease treatment, it costs a huge amount of time.

Some people suggest that increasing the cost of fuel for cars is the best way. I admit that it certainly can give an advantage of environmental protection. However, this way is also followed by some drawbacks and more efficient and effective ways should be adopted.\n\nOn the one hand, the elevated fuel price can reduce the use and purchases of private cars. Due to the high cost, people are willing to choose public transportation like buses or subways when they go out, which greatly decreases their carbon footprint. Furthermore,  some people who have plans to buy a new car,  are likely to consider hybrid cars or electric vehicles as a better choice as a result of cost-efficiency. As a consequence, the use and the purchases of gas-powered cars all  present downward trends, which therefore yields many benefits to the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, I am not in the support of the perspective that raising fuel prices is the best way. Because of the policy, many fuel companies tend to exploit more fossil fuels like oil for high profits, which leads to  dire damage to the environment, So, more efficient ways should be taken into consideration. For instance, governments should explore alternative energies via developing solar energy or building up offshore wind farms and increase people\u2019s environmental awareness through  public signs.

In this essay, I will analyze the perspective before arriving at my final conclusion. \n\nApparently, there are several reasons why the government should let any country sell goods to other countries. Firstly, it will boost the economic growth of the country; since domestic manufacturers search for many markets which attract citizens from other countries, and some foreign investment as well. As a result, with that impact, the economy of the country can be developed at a high speed. Secondly, without the government limitation, many international companies will have a chance to sell their products which means the average cost of goods will be lower due to no taxes. Consequently, more citizens will be able to buy more affordable goods that can reduce the rate of poverty and hunger.\n\nOn the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen. Initially, people can face the danger of banned substances. To be more specific, if there is no testing or limitation, some bad people will have the opportunity to put harmful substances not only in the food, but also in the products people use everyday. Therefore, consumers will be the victims of these crimes and have to deal with sickness or death. In the second place, there will be competition between local and international business. Since some people who are foreign-favored and now the price of those products is also low, it will be hard for the development of local companies.  \n\nIn conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.0"}]}

The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today\u2019s society\u2019s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today\u2019s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: When it comes to famous people, people hold conflicting views on whether the media should publicize the private lives of celebrities. While people believe that they should accept these lives as a part of their fame, I disagree with this phenomenon. \n\nTo begin with, there are a variety of negative problems publicizing the private lives of famous people. Indeed, it is important to know that when some media publicize the private lives of celebrities, which affects their spirit as well as their concentration on their work. It could be explained by the fact that they don\u2019t have the freedom to do anything that they love. Moreover, both celebrities and other individuals are the same, but celebrities are only different from other individuals in that they have many people who know about them with fame in some fields. For example, a famous singer who is publicized too much about their love,  can suffer pressure and then end their love. \n\nThere is another problem explaining why publicizing private lives is disadvantageous. Nowadays, famous people are an inspiration for many young people. Therefore, when publicizing the private lives of celebrities who were in adulthood, their lives can strongly affect youth when it comes to many aspects for instance. The reason is that when they have a good life, the younger people can get the experiences from them.  However, when they have a contrasting life, youth would copy this life which can badly affect youth's future life. \n\nTo conclude, I would argue that publicizing private lives can bring many disadvantages which impact not only celebrities but also especially on youth in their future lives."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: The recent increase in cases of obesity amongst humans is a cause for concern. It is often argued that this issue can be tackled by hiking the cost of foods that cause this problem. I completely agree with this point of view and therefore, in this essay, I will examine the reasons to support my opinion and provide a suitable conclusion.\n\nFirstly, raising the price of unhealthy eatables makes it less affordable to the vast majority of the general public. This is because, since most people have a fixed budget to spend on food, they are less likely to splurge on costly snacks and thus they will consume it in very low quantities. For example, if a packet of potato chips cost thrice as much as it used to, by default an average person will look to buy only one instead of multiple packs. This is to say that the higher the price, lower will be the consumption.\n\nSecondly, when the cost of commodities goes up, manufacturers will be forced to reduce production or even halt it. That is why when buyers cut down on buying their products, the company will suffer losses and hence they will be forced to stop releasing unhealthy edibles and maybe it can even encourage them to venture into making healthy snacks. \n\nIn conclusion,  changing the price of snacks that are bad for health will result in lower cases of obesity. I strongly believe making snacks unaffordable and forcing companies to stop producing foods that are harmful to health is the best solution to this problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Others  believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behavior  most.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: While it is true that watching TV affects children, it is difficult to determine  whether it is the content of the programs or the length of time spent watching  them that has a more significant impact on children. It seems to me that  although the amount of time does affect youngsters, it is the content of the  programs that has a more marked influence on them.                  On the one hand, the consequences of watching TV for long periods of time  can be deleterious. Firstly, the longer children are exposed to TV programs,  the more likely it is for them to become addicted to watching television.  When children become over-reliant on television for entertainment, they  might neglect engagement in outdoor activities. This may result in a  sedentary lifestyle that is highly detrimental to their physical health. More  importantly, excessive TV watching impairs children\u2019s communication  abilities, so they find it hard to play or live in harmony with others. As a  result, children would feel discouraged from having real interactions with  people around them if they spent a huge amount of time in front of the  screen, which may hinder their development of social skills.                             On the other hand, it is the broadcasted images that have the most direct  effects on young viewers. Firstly, in most countries the majority of TV shows  present glamorized depictions of inappropriate materials such as violence,  drug abuse or casual sex, thus youngsters may adopt unhealthy habits and  improper behavior. For example, they might fall under the impression that the  use of alcoholic drinks is fashionable without being aware of the health risks  they carry and later end up consuming these substances. Besides, in our  modern consumer society, commercials also affect how children behave.  Unwary young viewers could be easily swayed by captivating advertisements  for junk food or video games, products whose target audience includes  children, and so may pester their parents to buy these goods impulsively.            In conclusion, although both factors have their own implications, I believe  the element with more considerable impacts on children is the content.  Hence, parental involvement is essential in controlling children\u2019s TV viewing  habits and in shaping a child\u2019s values to help them enter adult life with a  healthy mind"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

Nowadays, Technology is improving by leaps and bounds in this modern world and all are moving towards modernization.\n\nFirstly, recent scientific research states that the majority of the things will be automated in the upcoming days. Secondly, most of the students are eagerly interested in robotics, a subject that deals in handling and controlling the robots. Robots are preferred over humans in order to minimize the required manpower and to cut down the expenses for a particular organization. For instance, there is a restaurant in which waiters are replaced by excellent robots which emulate the same work done by mankind. Consequently, this technique saves a lot of expenditure for the companies.\n\nContrarily, on the other hand, this top quality robots will surely make the life difficult for job seekers as it reduces the number of job opportunities. In addition to this, life of the common man becomes simpler and therefore making him a couch potato which is a negative sign.

It is essential for little ones to feel secure in order to further other ability towards socialisation. Neglected babies, for example, are proved to have emotional control and communicational problems in their adulthood.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.\nEssay: Voluminous traffic on the roads in urban areas has become a serious problem, in various countries across the globe. While there are myriads of contributing factors to this, over population and poor road infrastructure are the predominant ones. However, various positive measures, including; masses\u2019 facilitation in rural regions and construction of new roads, can be taken by the government to eradicate this issue.\nTo begin with, there are several causes of hike in the vehicles in metropolitan regions. Firstly, with every passing day, urban areas are getting densely populated. Owing to the fact that cities are equipped with the advanced academic institutes, hospitals and organizations, individuals shift towards such areas. For instance, the United State population control department reported 65% average rise in the students of tertiary education in 2018. Consequently, with the growing inhabitants, transportation sources are escalating, which is the ultimate reason environmental contamination. Secondly, lack of basic roads and highways is the significant cause of traffic jams and congestions.\nNevertheless, the governmental bodies are liable to control the vehicles on the road. If the competent authorities provide the residents of the suburbs with the educational and earning resources in their hometowns, the former would have no reason to relocate in the towns. To illustrate, building new medical centres, universities, and establishment of companies in the countryside would benefit the masses at their doorsteps. Moreover, a suitable budget should be allocated to construct more roads and bridges to overcome the traffic flow.\nTo conclude, the proliferation in vehicles on roads due to the growing population and worst road conditions is becoming a major issue in both cities and towns.

In my view, this finding history trend is so popular right now because some movies are based on people's houses and people currently like to talk about their stories online.\n\nTo begin with, the first reason driving people to invest time in researching their properties is the inspiration they draw from movies, especially thrillers, making them really curious about is there any treasures in their homes. For instance, in suburban areas of the United States, houses typically share a similar structural layout and exhibit prolonged usage. Inside these houses, dark basements and attics can be very similar to what happened in  films such as \"The Conjuring\" or \"Hereditary\". Consequently, viewers of such stories become motivated to delve into their own houses' histories to uncover if any mysteries are concealed within their walls.\n\nMoreover, another reason contributing to this phenomenon\u2014is the growing interest in society for online discussions on platforms. Users frequently engage in discussions covering a lot of topics, including mysteries, spirituality, nature, and more. When individuals face intriguing aspects related to their own homes, they eagerly share them in these online forums, seeking the opinions and advice of fellow users. This not only satisfies their desire to share but also allows them to engage in lively debates and receive valuable insights from the online community.\n\nAdditionally, people can research this mystery by consulting their neighbours. Some older people, who have spent almost their lives in the same neighbourhood, can know better than anyone else. They may acknowledge some of the previous owners and even their stories, they properly notice if there are any unusual things in their areas as well, which could be the biggest contribution to the result. Other than that people can try some variety methods such as using historical records, property documents, or hiring professionals in the field.\n\nIn summary, I firmly believe that some movies or TV series  appeal to people due to their mysterious theory about the house along with the increasing  young generation loving to bring their life on the internet, making the finding about the history of their houses in line with them.
