Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"I agree with both: many activities must be organise by parents as kids have not much knowledge about what to do sometimes.
Freedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.
Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.
Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...
Parents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...
At the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet.",5
Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of one international organization rather than the responsibility of each national government. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that one global institution should be responsible for environmental problems, while some people believe that each national government should take responsibility instead. While acknowledging the reasons for this proposal, I partly agree with it for several reasons. 

On the one hand, there are a lot of compelling reasons that environmental problems should be the duty of each national government. Initially, for artificial environmental problems, only the government could have the jurisdiction and capability to solve their own troubles. In fact, man-made environmental issues mostly might come from the big factories that could affect the economy of the country. It is the truth that one international organization could not have the authority to regulate these corporations and they might not grasp the complexities of the issues to deal with it in the best way. Therefore, the national government, who already understands the problems should take charge for their actions and solve their national artificial environmental problems since only them could possess adequate authority and could have the optimal strategy to address these issues in their own country.

On the other hand, in some emergency circumstances, such as natural disasters, the national government might find themselves lacking capability and resources to face it and in this case, one international organization should be in charge of these problems. It is obvious that, in the emergency circumstances such as sudden natural disasters, international organizations could provide money, food or even specialists in these fields. To be specific, since the global institution attracts a sum of power and experience from different countries around the world, they would have the ability to help these nations in a suitable way. For example, if a country  has to deal with a tidal wave for the first time and they have difficulties in dealing with it, the international organization could help them by combining the experience and knowledge from the previous disasters or they could gather the specialists in these problems to find an optimum choice for that nation. 

In conclusion, the division of responsibility is clear: national governments should address human-made environmental problems, while international organizations should take charge of natural disasters. This allocation of roles ensures a comprehensive and effective approach to addressing the diverse environmental challenges our world faces.",5.5
There is no need to go out to see live performance (concert...) because it is better to see them on the TV or Computer screen. Do you agree or disagree,"An emerging trend that has generated a widespread phenomenon in the entertainment industry is watching movies at home.  Taking all the convenience into account, I am inclined to believe that watching movies on personal screens is much better than seeing the staged performances. Not only will watching movie at home help us to save our precious time, but it can also be a private area to enjoy TV series.

To look at the entertainment aspect, the most important factor to consider is the daily form of recreation. If a person is using some private applications, or browsing websites while relaxing against some pillows with the TV playing in the background, instead of uncomfortable going direct to the social cinema, it will be one of the best options for their budget. Such forms of entertainment, moreover, will create a private space for us to watch wonderful movies without irritating others intensely. Another point that needs to be taken into consideration is that the more people are around, the more bad emotional feelings we will get. Even though it is true that we always find confidence and truly happy whenever we can gather with friends or family members, which can be ruined while watching in the social cinema with strangers. In order to avoid this situation, all we need to do is be on our own, find a great Tv show and relax.

With that being said, however, everything always has its defective sides and it is pretty true on home-movie watching. What really makes the audience truly bored with the film is a distraction. For example, assuming a person is watching his favourite movie, he might be momentarily distracted by social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or even the notification of messages which is pretty unpleasant. Due to the fact that watching movies in our private area can affect negatively our routine, we might be immersed in blockbuster movies or Tv series and be lazy. In addition, the blue light of computer screens will cause some contemporary symptoms such as eye strain, blur vision or headache.

In conclusion, watching the movie is on the rise, and watching movies on computer trend brings both advantages and disadvantages to our self and the others. Moderation is the key to maintain balance and solve these problems effectively.",5.5
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","It is indeed the fact that few cities across the globe experience the severe challenges of the high amount of traffic on their roads. This essay will discuss the potential reasons of this issue followed by the solutions to tackle them.

Firstly, the reason why some towns suffer from the increasing number of vehicles on the streets is no existence of a law related to driving restrictions. It means a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicle on a specific day or at a certain time does not exist which provides a liberty to drive anytime and anywhere. In addition, the inefficient public transport is the another major reason. It means that the distances across different destinations are not efficiently connected via public transport. As a result, people experience inconvenience while availing public transport to travel whereas opting to drive a private vehicle becomes a feasible option for them. For instance, due to the absense of direct connectivity of Delhi with Gurgaon, millions of employees residing in Delhi, drive to Gurgaon every day to work in their private vehicles which causes longer hours of traffic congestion at toll. 

However, the above-mentioned concerns are certainly be dealt by implementing the following methods. Firstly, public transporttransport can be improved which should connect all the major destinations in a city effectively and efficiently. This will definitely encourage commuters to shift to public transport which can increase their possibility of on-time arrival at their desired destination. Secondly, a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicles on roads, can be issued in which a driver must be penalized with the heavy challans upon violation. Consequently, the number of vehicle on the roads of a city will decline drastically. For instance, considering the concerning increment of vehicles on the roads of Delhi, the government implemented an even-odd rule which reduced a traffic by 40 to 45 per cent.

Consequently, although the increasing traffic in many cities is the result of the absence of required regulations and an effective public transportation, the improvement of the transportation system and implementing driving regulations can certainly address the issues.",5
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","The prevalence of people searching for information about the history of the place where they are living is increasing. I believe there are several reasons and two main ways that help with research about it. 

 

The major cause is probably the satisfaction of peopleâ€™s general curiosity, especially about the origin of their house or building, because for roughly two-thirds of the day they stay at home, so it is understandable if they want to know deeply about it. For example, they may want to know when it was constructed, who the former owners were, or what kind of materials were used for contracting. Furthermore, all this information may assist them in preparing a renovation plan for the future, such as which part of the house or building they should examine or the cost of the remodelling. That can make them feel more secure about their accommodation's condition. Finally, knowing about the history of their house or building may make them feel more appreciative of what they have, and in another situation, if they want to sell it, they can pass the information to the next owner because the purchaser might want to know. 

 

 

Turning to the ways to research information, first from the former owner or the landlord. For instance, if they just rent the accommodation, they can ask directly from the landlord. If they brought this place, they should get in touch with the person who was the former owner if they can get the address of her or his. The second way is by going to the local cadastral office. In this place, there will be employees working there to support the information fully. 

 

To summarize, the cause of this trend is primarily related to curiosity and the repair plan, and there are two ways to aid them: the landlord, the former owner, or the local cadastral office.",7.5
Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is denying the fact that the main purpose of hobbies is arguable. The truth is that avocation used to be a vital part of every individual's life routine but the question is why most people become do not spend their time doing their hobbies and what the effect of it on the individual and society.
While it is held belief that the avocation is needed time, but lifestyle become different for many people these days,they feel should be working almost of their time to can provide the primary needs for themselves or for children, because everything become expensive. So They spend most of their energy during work by the site for a long period in their office , so after they back home just need to relax and sleep.
On one hand, The most important one is the invasion of technology in our lives. Most people spend hours on cell phones, chatting, online shopping and generally surfing various websites such as Twitter and Fakebook. eat away most of the precious time that can be spent doing some healthy activity.
Therefore, it is having an adverse effect on the individual and society. The health problem increased a few years ago , especially heart diseases, diabetes and depression, community have become more distant from each other , and lack of feel peace in most of the people .
In conclusion , avocation is a healthy source to make the public more creative and have good health , where they can lose a lot of stress and develop their skills in a different field , away from work or other routine problems. But quite doing that led to many issues that the people found difficult to deal with it.",6.5
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"Rise in population, has led to an increase in the usage of vehicles that has resulted in many environmental problems. There are numerous people who think that the price of the fuel must increase. In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea that costly fuel will help solve various environmental issues. 

Firstly, the excessive use of natural resources used to manufacture a vehicle, causes countless environmental problems like deforestation, killing of animal for leather which results in irregular rainfall. However, the spike in fuel cost makes many people think twice before purchasing a vehicle. 

Secondly, the gas emitted from the vehicle cause various air pollutants to harm the environment and living beings. For instance, global warming, soil erosion that deteriorates the plants. Therefore, by enforcing strict laws like increasing the cost of fuel will make people opt for public transport, which will help reduce the usage of vehicles.

To conclude, it is important for us to remember that the earth has provided us with endless resources, now it is our turn to protect it and use it effectively.",4.5
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages.,"Nowadays there is a trend that people start having babies when they have become older. Although there are benefits involved in this trend, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages.

On the one hand, parents who have babies in their thirties and forties are more mature. That is they have more experience in order to raise their children. For instance, they can provide children with pieces of advice about the major they should study and their career path. Moreover, older parents tend to have stable jobs, so they can support their children properly. For example, they are capable of sending their child to private schools. This in turn will cause  infants to have a better future when they become adults.

On the other hand, a huge age gap between parents and children may cause different issues. One problem could be difficulties in communication. Because these parents belong to a completely different generation, it would be hard for them to understand their children. Take a teenager who wants to dye his hair pink as an example; his old parents would be really angry as he cannot understand the current trend in fashion. Furthermore, since old parents are more likely to face numerous health problems, they do not have enough energy to spend with their family. This may cause their child faces various emotional issues.

In conclusion, old mothers and fathers can support their children when it comes to financial issues. However, due to the huge age difference, they cannot provide enough emotional support for their children. This makes the downsides far more important than the benefits.",7
"Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.
On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits",6
"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Nobody is a stranger to the fact that we live in a digital world. Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. 

There are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. 

Be that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. 

Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. 

At the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans. This will develop their societies in a much more sustainable way.",7
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming in interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can poeple research this?","Nowadays, people are growing interested in the history of the accommodation they live in. This trend is mainly due to a business agenda for housing purposes and personal beliefs. Thanks to  technological advances like the Internet that makes researching  such information become easy.

There are a few reasons that make people start to search about the place where they live. Firstly, having particular knowledge about the building or the house can help in increasing the house value in the housing business. To illustrate, many customers are extremely into the history and fond of a certain type of building. Being able to explain and create a background story about the accommodation can potentially help the housing agency to win a negotiation with such clients. Another reason is that many people have certain spiritual beliefs that they adhere to. People, for example, believe that living in a house which had a history of a serious crime such as murderer, will result in bad fortune. As a result, searching for information behind the house will ease their decision whether they should stay in that place or not.

There are a number of ways to research such history. The first way is through asking neighbours or local people as they usually have some information about the area or the houses nearby. However, reaching from the internet via a search engine probably is the easiest and most accessible way since it contains most data about pretty much everything. Moreover, as most historical information is being updated regularly, it becomes very convenient to use this platform to find an up-to-date history about places.

To conclude, more people have become interested in the history of their accommodation because of business in housing and personal beliefs, and they can easily get that information from the Internet or from local neighbours.",7.5
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time,"There is a debate whether art should remain as a crucial subject at school or not.Some people admit that art should be considered as one of the compulsory subjects of the school curriculum because it helps to enhance students imagination and release stress.On the other hand, some individuals opine that art is not worth for pupils' time since they should put more afford and concentrate on the main subjects.Personally, I sided with the opinion that art should be taught at school. 

To begin with, children will have space to develop their ideas and imagination through pieces of art they created, they are able to express their emotions,thoughts and creativity through their work which can develop their depression and stress.This happened because kids perceived art as a subject with 'no right and wrong answers, so they are allowed to explore their passion.For instance, a recent study showed that the average number of pupils who chose Art for their major in universities rose dramatically in the past decades.

On the contrary, individuals may claim that kids ought to focus and put an extra afford into other important questions such as Math,Science or International languages.Therefore, they will have more opportunities to widen their academic skills for their further study; which will lead them to several stable and high-income occupations.For example, students who are eligible for pursuing a doctor degree need to get high scores on both Science and Math, which means they. need to study harder to achieve the achievement

In conclusion,despite the perspective of believing that art is a waste of pupils' time,I firmly believe that Art should be a compulsory subject in school's curriculum due to the fact that it broadens children imagination and diminishes their depression.",7
"Some people say that to prevent illness and

disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and

housing problems.to what extend do you agree or disagree?","Illnesses which caused by environment pollutant and housing issues has become increasingly .some people claim that to avoid sickness, government should allocate more attention on declining contamination from environment and accommodation problems. This essay will argue that why decreasing habitat corruption and home issues are completely necessary , however there are more elements that should be consider.

In the one hand habitat pollution and housing contamination have been always a serious matter due to these are the main causes for spreadable diseases in across the continent , they are forming severe damage to health problem not only for human safety but

released into the lakes and ocean have had considerably destructive impact on seas life, further it likely to have negative cause on food chain as well. for these reasons government should focus on environment and accommodation waste products.

On the other hand there are far more sources for expending harmful diseases which need to take in to account. Air pollution can lead to respiratory and breathing problems or in the worst condition it can provoke lung cancers. Pesticides and chemical fumes which emission into the open air are two main reason of dreadful sicknesses . for instance people whom live near facilities are suffering from dangerous bronchial problems . therefore it will be critical matters that need to find solution by governments.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","While the developed economy is believed as the sole solution for the alarming status of hunger and poverty. It is also considered as the main cause of environmental destruction. In this essay, both views will be discussed and from my perspective, I strongly agree with the former statement.

On one hand, economic growth enriches the budget for society. As a result, those unlucky people can give more support such as food or money. That helps them a lot in improving their daily life. In addition, developed economy has the high demand in the number of employees. In other words, providing a huge amount of jobs which would reduce the unemployment state. Thus, the poor now not only get job but also have chance to change their life.

On the other hand, increase in the number of factories is an evitable consequence of economic growth. That causes harm to the environment because factories are the main source of exhausted emission and other kinds of contaminated trash. Polluted air, water and soil are the outstanding examples for environmental damage by the factories. Moreover, to expand the industrial area aiming to serve the development of economy, forest will be destroy to make use of land. That leads to series of negative effects such as increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, green house effect,â€¦

In conclusion, the developed economy brings both pros and cons. In details, the positive results in eliminating hunger and poverty. In contrast, negative consequences on the environment. However, I suppose we should take advantage of growth economic rather than reject it. Even we can apply it in protecting the environment.",5.5
