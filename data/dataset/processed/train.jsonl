As,painting and sketches drawn by someone reflect truly about the creative nature of the person. Take the example of well known artist, Sadqain,his masterpieces are a real reflection of creativity of his mind revealing that how beautifully he summarized the ideas on canvas.Thus acquiring knowledge about art is considered to be imperative for growing minds of offsprings because of creativity. \n\nWhile on the other hand,advocates of the view that art is merely a waste of the time believe that spending turn on art subject offers no benefit because of the latest advancements and innovations in contemporary era. As, all developments are just because of the science subjects and no significant role of art is visible. For instance, a recent survey at university of Stanford revealed that over a quarter of students in the speciality of art were unable to make success in practical life merely because of the time wasted on this subject.Hence, studying art leads to waste of time. \n\nWhereas,I believe that learning art delivers creative ideas in a person's mind and it has long term benefits.So it has a good impact on minds of adolescents. \n\nTo conclude, spending time on art offers an abundance of advantages, especially the creativity and one should not consider it a useless subject."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

As a result, some believe that it is essential to allocate more money to trigger people to live healthier than studying treatments for the illness. From my perspective, I disagree with this statement because of the following reasons.\n\nOn the one hand, the more money uses to promote citizens, the more awareness those understand about a healthy lifestyle. Building many facilitated public parks, for instance, will encourage dwellers to be active, doing more exercise or doing outdoor activities there. It can lead to a decline in the number of adults safeguard from some problems related to their bones. Moreover, children and doodlers will have a spacious outdoor area to play with their friends, instead of staying home all day long, addicted to video games. As a result, it might cut down the rate of obesity at these ages.\n\nOn the other hand, the cure is the biggest concern to lengthen life expectancy. There are many diseases which do not relate to the lifestyle that threaten human life recently. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example. stems from the virus which made the death of many people around the world even if they are healthy or not. Therefore, living in a healthier way just help human reduce the effects of sickness, but it can not protect them certainly from some worldwide illnesses.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Increasing the cost of fuel to decrease environmental pollution is a popular idea in many countries. In my opinion, while higher fuel costs may have certain effects, there are numerous methods to improve the environment. \n\nOn the one hand, there are certain reasons why increasing the cost of fuel is beneficial. First, this may help reduce air pollution from vehicles. This is mainly because if the cost of fuel rises, people will use fewer personal vehicles. As a result, emissions from vehicles may decrease. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, people rarely use vehicles, so air pollution is significantly reduced. Second, the amount of pollution from many factories may fall. The main reason is that when the price of fuels increases, many factories will use different power sources which are environmentally friendly such as solar energy or wind power.\n\nOn the other hand, the government should adopt other methods to resolve environmental issues. To begin with, investing in public transport may be an effective way. When the public transport system is developed and modern, more people will use public transport. Therefore, the problem of air pollution may be lessened. Moreover, planting new forests and protecting current ones also help protect the environment. Every year, trees absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment. Also, the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees. Therefore, people should exploit forests rationally and prevent forest fires. \n\nIn conclusion, although increasing the cost of fuel has a lot of benefits, the government should care about different factors affecting the environment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child\u2019s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today\u2019s world. Babies\u2019 milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

It is essential for all the scholars to raise their doubts about teaching subjects to improve their understanding of the course. Many students feel shy to ask  questions during  class time, due to they might get criticised by the teaching staff. That's not true teachers are there to help the students to learn and understand the notes. Moreover, high school students should be encouraged to evaluate their issues in the course. This will advance the students to understand the topic in-depth and also teachers find out the ways to explain to the scholars for better understanding. \n\nOn the other hand, most of the students are fearful to ask their questions to master. Assuming that they will lose their respect and treat them as a poor student in the class. These assumptions made the student  misunderstand the subject and not able to achieve the required score in the real exam. For example, mostly girl students face this kind of issue.

Only government action can solve this problem.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Some today argue that only authorities are capable of countering problems in cities resulting from housing shortages. In my opinion, although the state should be the primary actor, individuals can also offer aid.\n\nOn the one hand, only politics have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. authority by design makes decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the last century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.\n\nHowever, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. Individuals will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform.

Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life.

Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.\n\nFirst of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.\n\nOn the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.\n\nIn conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Nevertheless, many support individuals self-charged to avoid burden to society. Although both views appear reasonable, I honestly believe governors must take care of old people\n\nThose who assert that it is individuals charged to take care of themselves indicate the mitigation of financial burden. In simple words, as the life expectancy escalated gradually, countries with rapidly aging populations must allocate more money and resources to their health care systems. Consequently, this disproportionate amount of money substantially increased the burden on governments' budgets, which resulted in the collapse of existing funding to tackle pressing issues like the housing crisis or disease pandemic. A well-known example includes India, where a surge in welfare and publicly funded programs hinder existing systems from handling the growing prevalence of chronic diseases while also addressing the needs of large and expanding senior populations. \n\nNevertheless, a leading cause to deny this argument is the reimbursement for retirees' perseverance during their labor age. Norway's high welfare payments are a salient example of high taxation returns in generous public assistance. At this place, people enrich the national budget by devoting their time and effort to the country's development, meaning that citizens contribute to taxes raised. The authorities can distribute these taxes further to develop their country, such as building hospitals, upgrading infrastructure, and paying for officials. The result is that by way of compensation for old contributors' devotion in their youth, money-related assistance and care services are introduced to the elderly, for example, free-of-charge health checkups or retirements home. It implies that governments\u2019 subsidies provision appears acutely pivotal as recompense for labor\u2019s dedication.\n\nIn recapitulation, even though the personal accumulation alleviates the strain on public funding, it cannot disclaim the urge to equipped senior civilians with proper welfare programs in response to their determination.

Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nEssay: In the present, social media has been widely used to communicate with other people and has also been used as a source of news. In my opinion, the upsides of using social media definitely outweigh the downsides.\n\nTo begin, social platforms have been generally used among every generation. One of the most significant concerns is that people tend to have less physical interactions with others in real life. For example, during meals, some members of my family were often on their phones, not having conversations with other members. In addition, since any person can post anything online, there is often a lot of fake news. So, some people such as the elderly are likely to be convinced and believe wrongful information.\n\nHowever, there are many advantages of social media to be considered. First, the platforms have made it easier for people to connect to each other. For instance, when I was an exchange student in Japan, I had to live far from my family, thus I would feel homesick. Having social media helped me to communicate with my siblings easily and made me feel closer to my home. Second, news can spread more widely and fast. To illustrate, in the past, people had to wait for newspapers every morning, but now people can read news anytime. As a result, people can be aware of harmful incidents or upcoming disasters so that they can prepare themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, although social media can lead to some problems including lower interactions between actual people, and fake news, it helps people from distant places to interact with each other more conveniently, and also helps news spread more quickly and widely.

Because of the fact that situations related to, for example, polluted air which also causes anoxia among the population, not are a paramount thing for all parts of the world, this may probably create national indifference. Thus, countries with a high percentage of oxygen are not considering the ways to remedy the situation concerning some crowded places, which will lead to a decline in efficiency and make the process of elimination at times slower.\n\nAdditionally, the scarcity of local funds and money invested by citizens leads to the incapability of the government to find out and eradicate the source of the contamination like wastes from factories into reservoirs, by itself.

The substantial influence of this trend has sparked controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. This essay will elaborate on both points of view of this issue and thus lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThere are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizen.

In that situation, if citizens do not raise their voices against pollution, the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some others believe that global warming is most appealing for economic practices. Poor communities are unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. For example, from 2020, The tech- giant company Apple did not provide charging adapters with iPhones upon purchase. Because they have avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth and conserved copper, zinc, and many metals used for manufacturing a charging adapter, this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers.

The full weight of law should be applied in imposing a variety of non-custodial sentences such as heavy fines and the confiscation of driving licenses.

Although I strongly approve of the former statement, I disagree that every teenager should be forced to do unpaid work.\n\nMost young volunteers can benefit from doing community work without pay in their spare time, as this work can help them take control of their free time and do exercise after strenuous hours of studying. Teenagers can utilize the time to make improvement to their society as well as relax by doing physical work, instead of just staying at home watching TV or playing video games. Moreover, the local community can take advantage of the free labour force and use the wage budget for better purposes, for example, equipping new facilities for the area.\n\nHowever, I believe it is up to the teenagers themselves to decide what to do in their leisure time, without any enforcement from adults.

Some people still believe that women cannot achieve perfect results in certain tasks and because of this reason,  they are not given the opportunity to show their worth. \nIn many countries, women are paid less than their male counterparts but at the same time, they are made to work more. They are not trusted with politics or  business management and so on. The people who hire women often fear that their family would come first than their job which can lead to less profit for the company or organisation. \n\nIt is true that women keep their family above everything because they have an  increased maternal instincts which make them protective towards their family but at the same time they can  balance everything equally whether it is professional life or family life.\nHistory has given us many women who had made a breakthrough in almost every field. But  they were not appreciated for their hardwork. There were many women in the past who were made to fade in the background even after their greatest achievements. So it is a right decision from the part of the Government to encourage  certain percentage of high level jobs for women.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea of encouraging and accepting women for high level jobs as it will enable to receive the best out of them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

Discuss both views and give y0ur opinion\nEssay: It is a common belief that the best job opportunity is related to a graduate degree, although another belief supports experience is more important to be successful. I will elaborate on both views, supporting by studying university. \nTo begin with, a brilliant career is linked to tertiary education. In these types of learning hubs are obtained to catch a dream job for individuals. Technical and practical lessons are learnt to the students because of being qualified in their future careers. For example, a laboratory course can enlighten in every circumstance. The students who do not utilize any project or experiment, they have a change an observation in there. Therefore, they have knowledge about whatever they initiate and ongoing anything in time. On the other hand, admittedly, some experience can only gain in failing behind to the job. Although\n, the employers who are hired without a university degree, need to expose from every bad side to realize another side of the job. That is to say, they have never completed their education and the experience is not adequate just to alleviate everything. For example, under 40 years old entrepreneurs have selected among college graduated businessmen and women in the last decade. In my perspective, a real open-minded and passionate about new things are just occurred after having enough intelligence. \nIn conclusion, the best employers usually get successful in their careers after tertiary education. Because the learning hubs open new windows for the students before any difficulties have emerged.

Some people think that human ability depends on their gender, while others argue that there are no differences. In my view, women and men have different characteristics.\n\nTo advance a convincing theory I could deal with, the research I read last month. It is said, both sexes have different mindsets, abilities and personalities. On the grounds of these ,differences the things that they are interested in and the way they do it vary. For instance, girls are keen on working in beauty salons, in the kitchen, in shopping malls and etcetera. On the other hand, boys are really interested in owning a company, even doing demanding work like working underwater. In addition to what I have just said, their body construction leads to this difference. Women are sensitive (physically and mentally) and they are weaker. On top of that men have a stronger bodies.\n\nAlthough our differences contribute to a variety of jobs, we all ways have exceptions. With the advent of social media, the way people think has been changing beyond recognition. Gone is the idea of males can\u2019t work in the beauty industry and the reverse is true for females.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is widely acknowledged by people that participating in sports at school is the best way to educate children to be cooperative in their daily lives. I personally do not stand for this assumption since nowadays pupils can easily learn it from movies. Besides, the fact that not every child is eager to do activity that needs physical ability like sports should be considered. \n\nTo begin with, there are plenty of movies which have topics about teamwork and now it is accessible for anyone including children. Besides, they also can learn other soft skill like language without needing a big effort to do it. For instance, an English cartoon movie called Aladin shows how the main actor collaborates with his team to build a castle, and it shows the enjoyment during the process which is also good for children for being calm when it comes to merging with their peers. Therefore, being a cooperative can be done by entertaining them.\n\nOn the same hand, not every children feels comfortable to do an activity related to exercise, and it is non-negligible for parents to support them. According to BBC  this summer, 6 out of 10 pupils do not enjoy activity-related sports and they prefer to spend their time playing dolls, especially for females. Not to mention, playing dolls with peers could also be a potential way to improve their ability in terms of collaborating.

Although some hold an opinion that it can be worthless and unnecessary to add art subjects in a curriculum, I believe art has direct relativity with one's creativity which can bring a plethora of advantages for the overall growth.\n\nOpponents of an art subject whilst school days have firm viewpoints that it does not bring success in career and every effort invested to get into those are waste. This is because many artists struggle to match their living needs. For instance, if a painter may have difficulties in selling his drawn painting, it eventually leads to struggle for a stable life due to lack of money. In contrast, a time utilized for learning active subjects like maths, science, accounts, and many more may come to rescue as they lead to high paying stable jobs like engineers, doctors, or chartered accountants.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, knowledge in art subjects from early age brings myriads of benefits for overall development. A study demonstrates that a child who has interest in those subjects from an early age have more patience to deal with real-life problems. For example, it has been evident that creativity acquired from learning arts leads to problem-solving; that mostly results in thriving in a career as one has skills to solve difficulties.

To what extent do you agree or disagree\nEssay: It is believed by people in some countries that owning a home is more preferable and important than renting one. I believe that any decision, especially in living cost management, has been considered thoroughly by comparing the advantages and disadvantages. This essay will explain why people choose to buy than rent a home. \n\nThere are several factors that people are considered before choosing to own or rent a home. One of which is the increasing price of a property from time to time. For example, a housing price today is 3 million rupiahs per meter. Next year, the price is predicted to increase by 5%. The housing price normally increases every year. Thus, many people believe that owning a home is a good investment.\n\nAlthough the price of a home is expensive, many people can not afford to buy it. As a consequence, they have to pick the renting option. Looking at this situation, there are several schemes offered by each country to support their citizen to own a house. For instance, in Indonesia, the government subsidize a house for each citizen. The price of the subsidised home is discounted up to 50% with a credit payment. Therefore, owning a home is very possible for everyone from the richest to the poorest.   \n\nIn conclusion, I think the culture of people to own a place to stay is a positive thing. Because a house is considered a safe place for everyone,  people do not need to think about the billing issues once they have a home."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. \nDiscuss the both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: What should and should be not a part of school curriculum, has always been a debatable issue. In the viewpoint of some people, certain subjects like history and art taught to the students, have no practical use in real life and hence should not be included as a part of the education, while others are of diverse opinion. I, believe that every course learnt at a younger stage, adds value to the kid's life in one way or the other. This essay will analyse both the views as well as provide a logical conclusion.\n\nOn one hand, opponents of history, art and similar subjects, believe that pupils already have enough on their plate and therefore, the courses that are unlikely to be useful, in their future, should be excluded from the syllabus. For instance, the social studies mainly contain information about the past life of the man on the planet and the wars that took place in the yesteryears. However, today's theme is totally different from the last few decades, and wars are almost impossible, which makes the learning quiet irrelevant. Additionally, according to this group, creative courses like art and crafts, are only useful to the young minds, talented in that area, as they can pursue a career in the specific field, sometime in future. But, making these subjects mandatory for everyone, just increases the academic burden on the pupils. \n\nOn the other hand, the individuals who opine that everything learnt in school, is helpful to the minors at some stage, argue that even though the facts and figures learnt from any topic might not be directly applicable in real circumstances, they might be useful indirectly. To cite an example, even though reading about the battles between the Mughals and Sultans, seems a waste of time, it enlightens a child about the disasters, humankind can face due to the wars. Moreover, it also gives an idea about the culture as well as the traditions of the nation to him/her. To illustrate it, often the books describe the Kings, queens and their kingdoms before the anecdotes, which is an insight into the ancient day rituals. Furthermore, painting and drawing, assist the younger ones in channelising their negative emotions, such as jealousy and frustration, which can reduce incidents of bullying in schools. \n\nTo conclude, all subjects taught in educational institutions, help in the all-round development of the kids in one way or another. In my view, it is baseless to believe that certain things are a waste of time, as each topic imparts knowledge about different areas and aids the curiosity of fresh minds."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

A  popular stratum of society believes that spending wealth in the development of space exploration is necessary. However, in its sharp contrast, others opine that it is the sheer wastage of money which could rather be used to eradicate other issues of the community. I would like to delve into both the arguments before making an opinion.\n\nThe first school of thought claims that evolution of space technology has brought humans the possibilities of life in outer space, which is a huge achievement. According to some researchers, the end of the earth can be expected as a consequence of factors like pollution, global warming, etc. So, the space scientists are working on projects to produce habitat on other planets. They believe that without exploring the space or other planet physically we cannot have any idea about it. Moreover, without having prior knowledge of other spheres we cannot live there. In addition to this, developing space technology is compulsory.\n\nHowever, another group of person opines that spending wealth on space technology is surely a wastage of it. Every year a huge amount of money is spent on this by different countries to just prove their strength. They believe that as we live on earth humans should not face problems in their daily life to run their lives smoothly. Instead of spending too much money on space exploration program e governments should spend on social issues.

In my opinion, I agree that the increase in the price of  fuel  reduced the environmental concern by reducing the number of vehicles on the street.  However, educating people on environmental safety also have a way of solving environmental problems. \n\n \n\nOne of the best methods to decrease environmental problem such as pollution is by inflating the price of  fuels .

Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner\u2019s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one\u2019s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one\u2019s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one\u2019s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner\u2019s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee\u2019s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?\nEssay: It is argued that one global institution should be responsible for environmental problems, while some people believe that each national government should take responsibility instead. While acknowledging the reasons for this proposal, I partly agree with it for several reasons. \n\nOn the one hand, there are a lot of compelling reasons that environmental problems should be the duty of each national government. Initially, for artificial environmental problems, only the government could have the jurisdiction and capability to solve their own troubles. In fact, man-made environmental issues mostly might come from the big factories that could affect the economy of the country. It is the truth that one international organization could not have the authority to regulate these corporations and they might not grasp the complexities of the issues to deal with it in the best way. Therefore, the national government, who already understands the problems should take charge for their actions and solve their national artificial environmental problems since only them could possess adequate authority and could have the optimal strategy to address these issues in their own country.\n\nOn the other hand, in some emergency circumstances, such as natural disasters, the national government might find themselves lacking capability and resources to face it and in this case, one international organization should be in charge of these problems. It is obvious that, in the emergency circumstances such as sudden natural disasters, international organizations could provide money, food or even specialists in these fields. To be specific, since the global institution attracts a sum of power and experience from different countries around the world, they would have the ability to help these nations in a suitable way. For example, if a country  has to deal with a tidal wave for the first time and they have difficulties in dealing with it, the international organization could help them by combining the experience and knowledge from the previous disasters or they could gather the specialists in these problems to find an optimum choice for that nation. \n\nIn conclusion, the division of responsibility is clear: national governments should address human-made environmental problems, while international organizations should take charge of natural disasters. This allocation of roles ensures a comprehensive and effective approach to addressing the diverse environmental challenges our world faces."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

Do you agree or disagree\nEssay: An emerging trend that has generated a widespread phenomenon in the entertainment industry is watching movies at home.  Taking all the convenience into account, I am inclined to believe that watching movies on personal screens is much better than seeing the staged performances. Not only will watching movie at home help us to save our precious time, but it can also be a private area to enjoy TV series.\n\nTo look at the entertainment aspect, the most important factor to consider is the daily form of recreation. If a person is using some private applications, or browsing websites while relaxing against some pillows with the TV playing in the background, instead of uncomfortable going direct to the social cinema, it will be one of the best options for their budget. Such forms of entertainment, moreover, will create a private space for us to watch wonderful movies without irritating others intensely. Another point that needs to be taken into consideration is that the more people are around, the more bad emotional feelings we will get. Even though it is true that we always find confidence and truly happy whenever we can gather with friends or family members, which can be ruined while watching in the social cinema with strangers. In order to avoid this situation, all we need to do is be on our own, find a great Tv show and relax.\n\nWith that being said, however, everything always has its defective sides and it is pretty true on home-movie watching. What really makes the audience truly bored with the film is a distraction. For example, assuming a person is watching his favourite movie, he might be momentarily distracted by social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or even the notification of messages which is pretty unpleasant. Due to the fact that watching movies in our private area can affect negatively our routine, we might be immersed in blockbuster movies or Tv series and be lazy. In addition, the blue light of computer screens will cause some contemporary symptoms such as eye strain, blur vision or headache.\n\nIn conclusion, watching the movie is on the rise, and watching movies on computer trend brings both advantages and disadvantages to our self and the others. Moderation is the key to maintain balance and solve these problems effectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

This essay will discuss the potential reasons of this issue followed by the solutions to tackle them.\n\nFirstly, the reason why some towns suffer from the increasing number of vehicles on the streets is no existence of a law related to driving restrictions. It means a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicle on a specific day or at a certain time does not exist which provides a liberty to drive anytime and anywhere. In addition, the inefficient public transport is the another major reason. It means that the distances across different destinations are not efficiently connected via public transport. As a result, people experience inconvenience while availing public transport to travel whereas opting to drive a private vehicle becomes a feasible option for them. For instance, due to the absense of direct connectivity of Delhi with Gurgaon, millions of employees residing in Delhi, drive to Gurgaon every day to work in their private vehicles which causes longer hours of traffic congestion at toll. \n\nHowever, the above-mentioned concerns are certainly be dealt by implementing the following methods. Firstly, public transporttransport can be improved which should connect all the major destinations in a city effectively and efficiently. This will definitely encourage commuters to shift to public transport which can increase their possibility of on-time arrival at their desired destination. Secondly, a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicles on roads, can be issued in which a driver must be penalized with the heavy challans upon violation. Consequently, the number of vehicle on the roads of a city will decline drastically. For instance, considering the concerning increment of vehicles on the roads of Delhi, the government implemented an even-odd rule which reduced a traffic by 40 to 45 per cent.\n\nConsequently, although the increasing traffic in many cities is the result of the absence of required regulations and an effective public transportation, the improvement of the transportation system and implementing driving regulations can certainly address the issues."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

I believe there are several reasons and two main ways that help with research about it. \n\n \n\nThe major cause is probably the satisfaction of people\u2019s general curiosity, especially about the origin of their house or building, because for roughly two-thirds of the day they stay at home, so it is understandable if they want to know deeply about it. For example, they may want to know when it was constructed, who the former owners were, or what kind of materials were used for contracting. Furthermore, all this information may assist them in preparing a renovation plan for the future, such as which part of the house or building they should examine or the cost of the remodelling. That can make them feel more secure about their accommodation's condition. Finally, knowing about the history of their house or building may make them feel more appreciative of what they have, and in another situation, if they want to sell it, they can pass the information to the next owner because the purchaser might want to know. \n\n \n\n \n\nTurning to the ways to research information, first from the former owner or the landlord.

If they brought this place, they should get in touch with the person who was the former owner if they can get the address of her or his. The second way is by going to the local cadastral office. In this place, there will be employees working there to support the information fully. \n\n \n\nTo summarize, the cause of this trend is primarily related to curiosity and the repair plan, and there are two ways to aid them: the landlord, the former owner, or the local cadastral office."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

There are numerous people who think that the price of the fuel must increase.

In this essay, I will discuss my view as well as the opposing arguments. To begin with, technology is becoming more developed and it is targeted for the richer people. On the other hand, some may argue that an average person can afford it and that it is targeted for many income groups.\n\n\nFirstly, advancements in technology are becoming apparent. For example, new phones are being released and they perform improved functions. Thus, the company may charge more to cover the costs of production of these advanced features. Subsequently, it is more likely that a rich person will be able to afford newer gadgets. However, some poorer persons may also afford them. Furthermore, offers may reduce prices of products to allow the less wealthy to buy them.

Plus, with so many companies, a large proportion of services use technology to facilitate ease. Meanwhile, another viewpoint is that many groups can buy technological gadgetry.

There are abundant factors why these phenomena happen. Therefore, in this essay, I will explain the causes as well as the possible solutions for this issue.\n\nTo begin with, as traffic congestion mostly occurs downtown, one of the reasons for this  occurrence is lacking  entertainment facilities ,especially in the countryside and suburbs such as department stores, theatres, and amusement parks. It is undeniable that  some countries only have these entertainment facilities in eminent cities. That means whenever people in other provinces desire to go to places like that they have to go to that famous town also causing heavy traffic there later. In addition, some cities have poor public transportation making citizens in that cities select to drive private automobiles or motorbikes because of the convenience rather than using inferior public transport. As a result, there will be numerous vehicles on the roads.\n\nNevertheless, this phenomenon can be resolved with the assistance of the national government. The first sensible solution is for the government must improve public transportation in order to subside the number of  vehicles on the roads. If these public transports are easily available, extensive to various places, and low price, most populations will choose to use them more than cars or motorbikes. Furthermore, the government should generate new media centres in different places except for downtown. Thus, citizens do not have to go   downtown; instead, they are able to find entertainment facilities in their own cities.\n\nIn conclusion, the massive amount of vehicles on the roads has many causes such as poor transportation as well as lacking  facilities.

For example, due to global warming, the weather is getting hotter. Consequently, some people in Africa are suffering from it, and some of them died because they could not bear the weather.

A best illustration is that from my personal experience, last winter in January my cousin came from Canada and he had visited golden temple as well as got all knowledge about it after that he collected various pictures.As a result, museums has made a entertainment location for tourists.                                          \n on the flip side, there are multifarious reason which describe to  them behind the educational purposes.To put it simply, many schools, college and universities'  students are visiting over there  to enhance their knowledge as well as they can read about old fashion culture and see many scalpture owing to history. Moreover museums provide all previous history realted to what Happened in the past years and many more.A best example is that partition museum is renowned museum, which is located in Amritsar. It has a rich collection of stories,events,arts and artifacts related to partition of India in 1947. In turn, historical places also aid to gain the knowledge for learners.

As a result, in some cities, more people prefer using a car instead of bicycles. To my mind, the bike is better than cars. This essay shall discuss the reasons for this. \n\n     Bicycle is extremely important to transport vehicle in order to come into widespread using it and exploiting bikes has more advantages. Firstly, the health benefits of regular cycling can  increase cardiovascular fitness like causes to providing humans muscle strength and flexibility. As a result, people achieve to get improve their posture and coordination - which leads to decreasing stress levels.  Given  that, when people ride a bicycle on the  streets, they will not suffer from congested traffic. Additionally, exercising a car in North Korea has been banned for several years. For instance, the large number of people in North Korea utilize a bike and this factor is one main cause to stopping eco-pollutions. Besides, this situation shows decreasing body fat levels among  humans. \n\n     On the other hand, applying a car has become popular over humans. For example, more people becoming lazy riding a bike and giving attention only to cars. As a matter of fact, they have to spend long hours in traffic jams. Moreover, cars are increasing the level of air and noise pollution in cities and this causing many inhabitants to suffer from diseases such as respiratory, heart disease or cancers. \n\n    All in all, operating a bicycle is more important and helpful to population health and I think the government should give more attention to increasing bikes instead of cars."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: People's need for a place to live is often considered as something that is not important in Indonesian society today. This is clear from the government's policy of letting housing prices run out of control \u2013 and there is no real direction for change. I agree if the government thinks about  \u200b\u200bproviding free housing for people who cannot afford it. There are three reasons for my argument for poor people: efficiency, humanity, and economic reasons.\n\nThe first consideration at this time is efficiency, whereas to reach workplaces in the city center; people can only afford to buy a place to live in the suburbs, which is 2 to 3 hours from the city center. This is very inefficient considering that people will have to spend 4 to 5 hours every day on public transportation. If the government provides free or subsidized housing, so the costs are low, people will not have to waste 5 hours per day, and they will be more productive.\n\nMy second argument in favor of this policy is the humanitarian argument. Certain people with meager incomes and who do not have the skills for permanent work must be fostered and managed humanely to maintain their degree and dignity. For groups of people like this, special housing with supervision must still be developed in strategic areas but not in the city center. With special supervision and routine guidance, the housing facilities provided will be maintained, new economic centers will be formed while reducing the crime rate.\n\nMy closing argument is economic reasons. People like Indonesia today need peace in carrying out all the joints of the wheel of life. If people find it challenging to find affordable housing, life will be more chaotic and disorderly. This, in turn, will result in economic stagnation and increased social unrest. It is not an exaggeration to make special rules to convert land and managed it into a property for the poor because it does not need luxury but only needs shelter to avoid the rain and hot sun.\n\nIn conclusion, all problems, when thought about wisely, will get a solution. Likewise, people's housing, more a matter of funding allocation than anything else, needs political willingness from the government and is not a complicated problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Undeniably, the number of old buildings which needs to be restored is on an incessant rise in the contemporary world.It is often presumed that the renovation consumes huge amount and so, the amount has to be utilized for new buildings and roads.As well as offering my opinion, this essay will elaborate my contention on disbursing money towards restoration of ancient buildings, which is entirely justified.\nTo begin with, ancient constructions in major cities have come to the stage of restoration, which require large sum from the government.Is it completely preposterous to allocate large sum for restoration instead of investing in new roads or houses? One could argue not.There are a plethora of reasons to substantiate this view. The primary reason is that old buildings attract tourists because of the ancient construction techniques used in the process. In turn, this increases not only government revenue but also provides employment opportunities for the localites as they can act as tourist guides. In addition, old constructions carry the resemblance of culture and tradition followed in an area. Also, most buildings have stories behind the purpose of their constructions. For instance, Paris government has put in a huge sum in renovation of Notre Dame after the fire break \u2013 out few weeks ago reflecting the importance of that building. Unequivocally, these aspects bolster my confidence that it is entirely necessary to restore ancient runes even though it involves huge expenditure.\nNevertheless, it is argued that renovation involves enormous government revenue, which can be utilized for the purpose of new houses or roads.Many metropolitan cities lack in provision of basic amenities such as roads and houses. If the government can invest in this area, it can provide houses for poor and also provide proper connection facilities.Overall, though, this is pale in comparison to renovation since it involves huge lose of tourist revenue.\nIn conclusion, this essay discussed and elucidated my opinion that although renovation of old buildings include enormous government expenditure, it is extremely beneficial as this will bring more tourism income."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

In my opinion, I completely agree with this above statement, and this essay will discuss and support my stand.\n\nTo begin with, Firstly, famous people are easily eye catching to the young minds mainly because of their lifestyle and capital. As they possess the most expensive cars, clothes, property and jewellery, so this thing attracts teens more easily. For example, Shah Rukh Khan, he is one of the best and the richest actors in the Indian film industries who have a very luxurious lifestyle, and it has a great impact on teenagers to follow his footsteps in terms of fashion and style. However, young people ignore the fact that how hard he struggled to achieve so much. Secondly, their glamourous living encourages youngsters to buy things unnecessarily in order to look like them. Finally, Also, they spent lots of cash without thinking about their budget.\n\nAnother important factor that sets a wrong example for teens from celebrities is that they always represent the perfect body type in cinema or any public appearance although it not imperative to do so. But this mindset of the perfect figure is creating pressure among teenagers to have an excellent body shape as a result many are dieting neglecting their health. For instance, super models these days are so slim that every girl's dream is to become slim just like models, but this trend has proved detrimental for many young girl's mindset. Therefore, this trend of slimming down is leading many girls to an anorexic body which has potential risks to their health.\n\nIn conclusion, celebs high standard of living affects young people easily where they ignore their whole hard working journey and achievements. In my view, I strongly believe that these famous people set a wrong impression on teens in terms of money and fashion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

For example ,we all know as a result of this global problem most of the population who live in the world ,are suffering from weather conditions in their countries.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: In the contemporary world, after graduating high school it is possible for   teenagers to be provided with a job or continue their study   straightforward. It is thought that getting a job has some benefits,   whereas others suggest that getting it after studying at any college or   university could be better as they can learn some new information about   their areas of training.  To the beginning, it is considered that adolescents after finishing their   school need to be occupied because from their teen ages they have to   be taught to face some problems and troubles in their daily life. For   example, on an ordinary day someone from their family can pick up an   illness but the finance they have couldn't provide the treatment or from   their child ages they have been rising in poor and difficult times. As a  result most youngsters choose to work straightly after graduation from   school.  On the other hand, others, including me, declare that if youth will have   an occupation in their school years, their quality of work might be poor   of skills and experiences. So that they should learn everything in details   at colleges and universities. They cannot be professional of their direct   area of work without the diploma of bachelor's degree.

They believe this would benefit both the individuals, teenagers and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is often believed that adolescents are supposed to do volunteer works in their spare time to contribute to their society. It is also considered that their efforts are beneficial to the public as a whole. I do not support the whole idea. In this essay, I will try to portray the reasons behind my partial disagreement. \n\nFirst of all, there is no denying the fact that the youth are the energy that drives a nation towards prosperity. Usually, youngsters are really motivated when they try something new. Besides, when teenagers contribute to a project that is useful to the people, they feel a sense of belonging too. At the same time, this is great for the country, since the contributions from the younger generation will help the nation move forward. \n\nHowever, in my opinion, it is compulsory to make sure that no good work goes without reward. Anyone who has done something good for anyone deserves to be compensated for it. The idea of remuneration will definitely encourage the youth to participate in the upcoming developmental ventures. For this reason, I believe it would be logical to pay for the work the teenagers do for society. Consequently, it might potentially make more people join the trend of playing their designated role in the process because of the fact that their works will be acknowledged. \n\nIn conclusion, as great as it may appear to contribute to the people but every positive effort demands to be noticed.

In my opinion,  the museum can be considered both educational and entertaining for visitors.\n\nOn one hand, some would think the main function of the museum is to entertain. They claim that visitors may considerably feel bored when a place is full of informative and educational content. This is because the museum has been regarded as one of the significant attraction places, where people enjoy watching spectacular objects related to history. For instance, they use interactive games and exhibitions to create a unique experience for people while others deploy cutting-edge technology to revive critical historical events. This is resulted in attracting more crowd to visit this place. \n\nOn the other hand, advocates of the second perspective claim that museum plays a vital role in teaching people about the different aspects of life, particularly their history.It is a destination where people obtain valuable knowledge behind each object in a museum. If it was used for entertaining purposes, it would negatively affect their learning process. Some museums, for example, employ tourist guides to give visitors educational tours while others provide people headsets so that they can listen to a detailed commentary about the exhibition. \n\nTo sum up, there has been a contradictory view about whether a museum should be regarded as an entertainment or educational destination.

Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?\nEssay: Recently, more and more food waste has been produced by people around the world. This essay will explain the reasons for this trend as well as propose possible solutions.\n\nThere are two crucial explanations for why people waste a huge amount of food. The first contributor to food waste is the fear of privation. Various consumers buy food without planning what to do with their food, which they think is necessary and do not want to lack it. Another cause of food waste is misunderstanding food safety. Many people do not know the correct way to store different kinds of food, which leads to faster food expiration. Moreover, people throw away edible food just because they are out of best-before date, although it is not spoiled.\n\nIn order to reduce food waste, actions can be taken from both sellers and consumers. For businesses like food companies and retailers, it is necessary to provide more detailed information on the packaging, for example, food labels or exact ingredients, to educate people about food, while they still have to make sure that food is safe for consumption. For the consumer, planning meals and ingredients for a week or two before buying food is the easy way to prevent over-purchasing, or they can try to recycle leftovers to use in the following meals.\n\nIn conclusion, health concerns and lack-of-food fear are the principal reasons for food waste, which can be tackled by informing consumers about food labels and planning food meals"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress, and this essay serves to elaborate on my opinion.\n\nA majority of people argue that employers prioritize the quality of their work. When people pay all their attention to working, their production and performance in a company will be better and bring several benefits for both themselves and this company instead of spending time on resolving the problem related to fashion. Specifically, their company receives more reputation, hence employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted. For instance,in a prestigious company like Apple, there are no requirements about the employees' dress, Apple's employees spend most time on design, fixing errors, and enhancing their products. These criteria made Apple become a famous and successful brand and community with several electronic devices existing everywhere.\n\nMoreover, the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment. Several companies force their workers to wear impolite clothes with many costume accessories, some staff want to show their wealth to others by their fashion style and only interact with people who have brand clothes like them and avoid working with people wearing simple clothes. Hence, after a long time, these kinds of working environments may become a fashion competition, instead, people have to create ideas, and products to promote and increase the company's profit. Many companies have collapsed for a similar reason that the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low-quality working environment, so many employees quit their jobs and these companies lose their customers.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that bosses should not impose dress rules on their staff based on the effect on the productivity and workplace."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

While there are some reasons why this trend happens, several solutions can be taken to solve this problem.\n\nTo begin with, this tendency happens due to a number of reasons. The first one is that the more products people manufacture, the more trash such as defective items people throw at the nature, especially the aquatic habitat. This would result in water or air pollution. Additionally, in order to get necessary materials such as wood for the manufacturing process, businesses\u2019 owners normally have to gain them by exploiting from the environment, which could lead to deforestation or soil erosion. For example, the Son Tung logging company used to cut trees a lot, which led to the biggest flood ever recorded in the history of Vietnam.\n\nFortunately, several measures can be done to deal with this issue. Firstly, entrepreneurs can apply technological developments to recycle trash, so that, these trash can be used again and again. By following this idea, enterprises can reduce the regularity of leaving trash in the nature. Secondly, the government should apply some laws against exploiting natural resources. For example, if I keep illegally deforesting the Amazon rainforest despite not being allowed to do it, I might result in  permanently being in jail as a punishment or even being put to death penalty.\n\n\nIn conclusion, when manufacturing consumer goods, people exploit resources from and throw trash at the environment, which would lead to negative impacts on nature.

In this essay, I will explain my viewpoints in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, the front and centre in this favour are that cars are necessary means of tools for commuters due to inconvenient public transport in a rural area.Moreover, it is undeniable that the exhaust gas emitted by the usage of automobiles causes environmental pollution. However, raising money for fuel does not solve the root of the phenomenon. For instance, people need to pay more for fuel in order to get to a specific location, which does not change the probability of use. This indicate that this policy would not improve much environmental issues.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, transportation indeed plays a vital role in our daily life. Considering  carbon dioxide emission, it is the leading cause of air pollution. Therefore, the government may divert some budget to build more facilities for public transport. On the other hand, if they provide some discounted ride plans for taking ones, it would be a better way to decrease the chance of the use of private vehicles. The monthly pass is a salient example. Based on such compelling evidence, it appears that government incentives may improve air pollution. \n\nIn summary, the growing use of automobiles is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is widely believed that the promotion of public transportation can solve environmental problems nowadays."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\nEssay: Nowadays, one school of thought believes that higher authorities should introduce rules considering the nutrition of the masses to improve their health however, others reckon that individuals should choose their food by themselves. This essay will disuss both the views and according to me, having freedom for choosing own diet is much more beneficial than levying restrictions.\n\nTo commence with, the salient reason why bureaucrats should impose laws on food choices is that, presently, fast food is cheaper and individuals are very much interested to consume these kind of meals regularly which would lead to numerous diseases among people because of presence of toxins in these products such as obesity, diabetes , blood pressure, etcetera. For mitigating these issues, administration should impose regulations about the nutrition which they have to consume. To exemplify, recently, Italy government have introduced the code of conduct where soft drinks are totally banned in the country in otder to preserve the health of residents.\n\nOn the paradoxical side, there are myriad reasons why people should have freedom to select their own meals. Firstly, if the authorities ban the unhealthy items, then it would create a huge loss to the producers of these items which may results in revolt by these persons against the law. Secondly, government should not infringed the right of humans. Masses must have the right to eat whatever they want as they are educated enough and perfectly know what is right and wrong for them. Therefore, bureaucrats should not interefere in the personal life of citizens. To epitomise, many youngsters are now aware about their health, so they prefer to go to gyms and do workouts or adapt weekly diets to remain fit in life. \n\nTo recapitulate, although, higher authorities will create a rules to bring a balance between healthy and unhealthy things, whereas, I personally opine that dwellers should have independence in choosing their own nutrients to avoid riots and stop infringing the freedom of individuals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

Indeed, these differences lead to sort some jobs, according to gender. It has been stated that men are better to perform specific tasks, while other tasks can be done by the soft gender.  In my opinion, I totally agree that some types of work require a specific gender.\n\nFirst of all, men's characteristics make them suitable for hard jobs. Physically, a man's body is much stronger than a woman. For example, in the United States of America, around 98% of the construction labourers are male. Such workers can take the difficult job situations.  In addition, the females' ability to work under pressure is less than males. It can be seen that a woman can be stressed because of a small amount of pressure. Meanwhile, males are able to face stress in a better way.\n\nSecondly, a male cannot take much emotional responsibility as a female does. In jobs that require significant emotional aspects, women have proved to be a better fit. For instance, a recent study in Canadian schools shows that the top 20 teachers in Canada are females. A teacher needs to emotionally understand students to help them in the educational process. However, female teachers can easily build a good relationship with students. Thus, women are able to handle jobs that need emotional.\n\nTo conclude, hard jobs need a person who is strong both physically and mentally. In contrast, some jobs require someone who has inspiring feelings. Hence, men are better at some jobs, while women are better in other jobs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

What factors may have caused this situation and what is your opinion, should be done about it?\nEssay: In this modern era, a majority of university pass-outs could not able to find their desired jobs. This is happening due to the proliferating competition for jobs and less technical skills. In my opinion, the local government should create more job vacancies for youngsters and more technical knowledge should be awarded them so that they may find spot-related to their skill. This essay will intend to analyse both aspects in detail with relevant examples.\n\nThe first fundamental reason why young graduates could not secure work according to their profession is the ever-increasing clash for jobs. This is primarily because candidates who apply for the jobs are far more than the number of vacancies. As a consequence, young adults failed to secure a position link with their trade and commence low-level jobs. To tackle this major issue higher authorities should create more number of vacancies for youngsters so that they may find work related to their streams. For example, in 2019, the UK government create one million vacancies through foreign investment for pass-out candidates. Therefore, this high job clash could be resolved through ministry initiatives.\n\nSecond major problem is that youngsters have a low level of technical skills. As a result, they could not fulfil the profession skills requirements of the companies and struggle to receive any job. For example, the latest press release by Google company reveals that in their interview only 10% candidate receive any selection latter. To mitigate this serious issue the legislators should commence a skill development program so that youngsters may nourish their technical skills and secure employment. Moreover, if the youngsters of a nation have excellent technical abilities then that country can secure huge progress in a short period of time.\n\nIn conclusion,It has been observed that university pass-outs could not able to find their desired jobs. This is happening due to the proliferating competition for jobs and less technical skills. In my opinion, the local ministry should create more post vacancies for youngsters and more technical knowledge should be awarded them so that they may find work-related to their skill."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\nEssay: The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Some people say that they should accept it as a part of their fame.do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: I disagree with the view that celebrities have to accept the manner in which their private lives are made  public by the media. lt is undeniable that they are in the spotlight and want to be popular by choice.  However, their rights to privacy need to be protected as well, as they too are humans. I shall put forth my  arguments in this essay.  To commence with, celebrities are already under a lot of pressure to perform well, as they are public  figures and are always in the public eye. Be it a politician, a sportsperson, a singer or an actor, all these  professions require them to be at their best at all times. This stress of someone constantly following them  affects the way they perform, which ultimately leads to a loss for the masses.  Secondly, these celebs are role models for the people. When any negative side of their private life is  exposed, their followers think it glamorous to do the same, which is definitely detrimental for the society  as a whole. For example, if people come to know that the celeb they adore, smokes and drinks in private  life, they think there is nothing wrong in doing so and also copy their idol. This is where responsible  journalism is needed.  Undoubtedly, the celebrities choose this life for the name and fame and to be ln the spotlight. Without the  media, the term celebrity will not hold any meaning. However, that doesn't mean that the media and  paparazzi have a right to stalk them at all times. To add to it, sensationalizing the news in order for the  channel to get more TRP is unethical. Responsible journalism and some ethics need to be followed by those  who get the news to the masses, as they may adversely affect someone's personal and professional lives.  Who doesn't remember the unfortunate incident when the world lost a very eminent public figure, Lady  Diana? That accident happened because the paparazzi were chasing the car she was travelling in. lt is  something which could have been easily avoided, had the paparazzi been a little rational in their behavior.  To sum up, it can be reiterated that responsible journalism means knowing its limits. Celebs too have their  private lives and they have a right to privacy. The media has to be judicious in knowing what to report and  how much to report, and should never misuse its power."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.0"}]}

Do the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages.\nEssay: Nowadays there is a trend that people start having babies when they have become older. Although there are benefits involved in this trend, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages.\n\nOn the one hand, parents who have babies in their thirties and forties are more mature. That is they have more experience in order to raise their children. For instance, they can provide children with pieces of advice about the major they should study and their career path. Moreover, older parents tend to have stable jobs, so they can support their children properly. For example, they are capable of sending their child to private schools. This in turn will cause  infants to have a better future when they become adults.\n\nOn the other hand, a huge age gap between parents and children may cause different issues.

Take a teenager who wants to dye his hair pink as an example; his old parents would be really angry as he cannot understand the current trend in fashion.

Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.\nOn the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.\nOn the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?\nThe main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.\nTo sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character.

Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. \n\nThere are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. \n\nBe that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. \n\nTurning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. \n\nAt the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life.

This trend is mainly due to a business agenda for housing purposes and personal beliefs. Thanks to  technological advances like the Internet that makes researching  such information become easy.\n\nThere are a few reasons that make people start to search about the place where they live. Firstly, having particular knowledge about the building or the house can help in increasing the house value in the housing business. To illustrate, many customers are extremely into the history and fond of a certain type of building. Being able to explain and create a background story about the accommodation can potentially help the housing agency to win a negotiation with such clients.

It is also considered as the main cause of environmental destruction. In this essay, both views will be discussed and from my perspective, I strongly agree with the former statement.\n\nOn one hand, economic growth enriches the budget for society. As a result, those unlucky people can give more support such as food or money. That helps them a lot in improving their daily life. In addition, developed economy has the high demand in the number of employees. In other words, providing a huge amount of jobs which would reduce the unemployment state. Thus, the poor now not only get job but also have chance to change their life.\n\nOn the other hand, increase in the number of factories is an evitable consequence of economic growth. That causes harm to the environment because factories are the main source of exhausted emission and other kinds of contaminated trash. Polluted air, water and soil are the outstanding examples for environmental damage by the factories.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: It is argued that the primary advantage of multinational companies is to the surroundings whilst, others disagree and believe that world business is their number one objective. This essay agrees with the argument that businesses are more benefited as they make a huge profit rather than the protection of the environment.\n\nTo begin with, many people say that big companies help to protect the environment by funding various programmes and projects. In other words, these business companies donate thousands of dollar to the cause that protect the natural environment such as helping for forestation. To exemplify, Coca-Cola, a world-renown multinational company spends 15%  of its total profit (which is equal to millions) annually to plant trees in the deforested areas of the world. Hence, in this way environment is benefited by the big cooperations.\n\nHowever, I believe that, the giant cooperations mainly focus on making a profit and their own business because millions of dollars are invested in the firm. This is to say that, thousands of people put their money on these companies expecting to get profit so the first and foremost goal is making money for the investors. For example, if a multinational company does not make a profit then the investors and shareholders begin to withdraw their capital from the business, which can result in the closure of the firm. Therefore,  international businesses primarily target to earn a profit than secondly, contribute to protecting the environment.\n\nIn conclusion,  global companies can greatly help to protect the environment by funding various programmes that work to save the environment. However, international firms first work to get profit and benefitm the business world because of the pressure from the investors to raise the money back then only they can offer their help to safeguard the surroundings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Actually, a lot of organs and the government should put this  their priority. To cite an example, they can set some rules for recycling and using renewable energies instead of coal. On the one hand, using less amount of paper can reduce cutting the trees and can prevent erosion.

Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nEssay: There are more and more parents who would like to teach their children at home rather than letting them learning at schools in some states. I think these parents' views are unreasonable and its disadvantages outweigh the advantages, because firstly, schools have more professional learning resources than home and secondly, pupils obtain the unique group experiences at schools. \n\nThe education departments and agencies control the largest amount of education resources than single family. Kindergardens, schools and collages own a lot of teaching materials, instructing aids, professional teachers and considerate libraries for students. Meanwhile, the governments invest a large number of money to each school in order to continue improving teaching and learning efficiency of them. Kids will be difficult to access these benefits if parents do not send them to schools. For example, in Shanghai, each primary school is funded by the local authority nearly one million pound to develop their teachers' group and teaching devices, which is impossible to be achieved in any pupil's home. \n\nIn addition, students can acquire the experiences of collective lives. Some people might argue that teaching children at home which is one-to-one model. This will be more effective for learners to get a better grade in exam. However, examination is not the only goal of the education. Understanding how to cooperate with others and communication skills in the same age groups are also essential to each child. For instance, except for lessons, there are many activities and workshops organised in schools. Pupils could understand a lot of rules to cooperate with others and the communication strategies to make others feeling comfortable.

Although giving birth in old age might come with several problems, it helps the parents to have money to cater to their children's education, and basic needs and to be psychologically ready for it which I believe outweighs the disadvantages as the childbirth complications can be treated with adequate medical intervention, however, lack of preparedness can lead to mental illness of both parents.\n\nTo start, late childbirth comes with some issues  which are detrimental to the mother's health. Complications like Ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages (early pregnancy loss) congenital disorders, high blood pressure, and chromosomal condition in the child such as Down syndrome.

Afterwards, women that gave birth at an early age abandon their children due to insufficient income and lack of mental preparedness which affect their children's education and mental well-being .

Besides, continuing to  improve  the world, robots will do heavy jobs for people, while knowledge is the one which does not replace.\n\nOn the other hand, getting a job right after high school also brings a lot of benefits. For example, while peers need to spend 3 or more years to learn higher education, they can earn money by themselves, not be dependent on family and save time. Furthermore, nowadays the development of society also makes opportunities for people who do not have qualifications in networks such as Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, and Instagram. \n\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny the advantages and disadvantages of both ideas, but in my point of view, the latter idea is more efficient and easier than the former."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

In my opinion , I completely agree with this view and think that there are  many useful aspects to this approach .\n\nFirstly , it is well known that  voluntary activities help teenagers to improve rapidly their personalities  .In other words , those young people ,who decide to leave their comfort zone and participate in  uncomfortable unpaid work, meet different mentalities and stop be  timid and  introverted people. Moreover , they introduce themselves to novel ideas and new skills and therefore they become more confident and mature . For example, research shows that adolescents ,who are more sociable and  communicate  with many types of people in their daily life ,develop  strong personalities and can achieve their goals in the future  . That's why  voluntary work makes teenagers able to have a wonderful personality .\n\nSecondly , I believe that this form of activity can bring  economic growth .

Although some believe that increasing cultural contacts with outher places in positive, becuase it increases the diversity and accessability of different products to the local market, others believe it leads to the lose of the national identity. In my opinion, international relationships have a negative impact on  the local society and should be prevented. In this essay, I will provide examples and arguments to support my opinion. \n\nOne argument in favour of my view is that by allowing international companies to access the local market, domestic businesses might lose substantial amount of money. This can lead to the closure of local factories and an increase in the rate of unemployment. As an example, 15 years ago, the American government permitted the import of European cars. In the following 7 years, the local car industry lost more then 10% of their earnings , and was forced to fired 10,000 employees. This example show, that international business interaction can have a negative affect on the local financial market.\n\nAnother reason to support my opinion, is that by teaching children new languages,  international words are being incorporated into the local dialect, leading to the lose of the local language vocabulary. For example, a recent study by the Jerusalem Univeristy published in 2014, found that more then 20,000 words in the Hebrew language have been replaced by international words, since the English language was incorportaed into the educational system. This demonstrates, that multiculturalism can change our language, and effect the richness of our native tongue. \n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that increasing business and cultural interactions with other countries, have a severe effect on our society and should be prevented.

Art is not only considered as an extra-curricular subject  but is also a passion many children willingly follow. I opine with the matter that art should be  considered a major subject at schools. The following paragraphs will detailly present the pros and cons of this.\n\nFirstly, drawing helps to relieve stress among students, since they will be already exhausted at schools by solving difficulty trigonometry in mathematics and grabbing stuff from other subjects where they have to tire the brain. However,drawing helps to relax the mind and allow students to be more attentive at school, whereas a recent survey carried on  by a group of scientist has proven that the intellectual ability of students vastly  increases when they take part in an extra-curricular activity. Substantially, Art should be a mandatory subject at schools at least once a week, since nowadays in  society depression is a huge detrimental issue .\n\nOn the other hand, some people consider drawing is just a waste of time in school rather than that children can focus on their important stuff considering the fact that art does not play a big influence in their future careers to cite an example, there are many people who have chosen their professional career as an artist, they are now facing a terrible time with their livelihood due to the insufficient amount of money they get from this profession, hence due to this fact parents are more scared that their children will full time involve in drawing and will not give any focus to other subjects, since parents always want  their kids to have a high ranking professional in the future. According to the opinion of the current society,the place they give to art is soo low.\n\nTo conclude, the fact whether art should be a mandatory school subject or it should be dropped out of the programs, ironically speaking  creativity, freedom, self-discipline all can be learned during the art classes since children are free to do whatever they want this is a good relaxation meditation for the juvenile, developing brains.I would think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages so it should be a must for the school curriculum to have art as a subject."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

However, certain innovations are inaccessible to the poor because of their high cost.\n\nCertain inventions and discoveries decreased the gap between people of different income levels. This is because they are accessible to all people due to their availability at cheaper rates. For example, the internet technology is available to almost all sections of the society.

My convention will be explained. \n\nOn the one hand, despite disagreeing that people do not get satisfied as they have everything, some advocates believe that any growth in salaries or other life materials helps families to live better. This means that when parents get an increase in their salary, they can buy things that they could not afford  earlier.

Hence, what can be said is that any increase in the means of living, even in a small way,  affects positively  life.\n\nNevertheless, opponents and I are convinced that any rise in the country can transform families' lives as some big countries have poor people. In other words, when Governments get extra money to spend on institutions like hospitals, parks and schools, they are creating finer life. To illustrate, Switzerland is one of the richest in the world but this did not make its individuals less satisfied with any increase in  salaries as life has become so expensive.

In my point of view, this trend would create several benefits but there would be some drawbacks arising.\nOn the other hand, attending indirectly interactive courses is immeasurably beneficial to both professors and students. In other words, online courses bring so a wealth of convenience to learners since they enable students to save their quality time and finance as well. To be more specific, students can take part in any courses that they are interested in regardless of geographical distance or travel cost, which helps to reduce various burdens and enhance the gross enrollment rate significantly due to this flexibility. In contrast, a fixed curriculum in traditional classes makes students arrange their time and own schedule passively, which can limit their time management skills. In Vietnam, for instance, during the quarantine, online classes offered to students enable them to acquire knowledge sufficiently in safety without any time pressure or extravagant price of traveling.\nOn the other hand, there are also compelling reasons why this trend may bring some disadvantages. To start with, students may lose face to face interaction in unsociable learning hours, which can lead to non-comprehensive development in several immensely essential skills including interpersonal and communicative ones.

However, some others are opposed to this idea, claiming that increasing economy is negative affects on natural environments. Both views are true to some extents, but I believe the former is more rational.\n\nI can understand some why people believe that rising economy has an adverse effect on the  environments as well as human beings.

First of all, the development of economy leads to rising government\u2019s budget that used for education and welfare aims as well as support those who are in difficult circumstances.

The increased prices may incur some economic issues such that as the cost of products or shipping can increase, authorities have to take precautions like making a raise. As a consequence, this, with increasing overpricing propels  society into a negative circumstance since the balance between products and their prices will be disrupted, and the majority of society may suffer from poverty.   That is why, making a raise is not a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, punishments in which prices are increased are not a suitable way to solve this problem because it stems from many different reasons such as generating electricity and manufacturing processes as well as cosmetic industries.

Therefore,  overpricing is not the correct way to solve, and also it causes many different problems such as economic and wealth issues.\n\nTo conclude, the aforementioned reasons play a crucial role in objecting to this view because this seems like the cure is worse than the disease.

To illustrate, the New York Times  publishes an article about the responsibilities of children at a young age which surge  from the year 2019 to 2020.As a result, the bonding between both are very strong and brings more happiness in the family.\n\nIn conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that youngsters show more responsibility. This is because education is most important  and in addition to family bonding. Given this situation, it is recommended that the government around the world should think about implementing this form of encouragement through  online media."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

This essay disagrees with that statement and will first discuss on how the officials spends the levy they gathered and then talk about how the collection help in the economy of the state.\n\nThe government does not have enough funds in sustaining the needs of the people. That's why they need to collect the money so there will be a fair distribution for the needs of the country. In the United States of America, which have the most collected compensation of about $23 billion dollars, part of their collection goes to homeless people who cannot afford to provide the basic necessities in life which includes shelter, clothes, foods and medicines. Another division of it, is intended to be reserved in case when there are calamities will happen. \n\nAnother point to consider is the money that the administration gather. It will give an impact to the economy of the country. Through the money that has been collected, it will give rise to more infrastructure and buildings that can open to a lot of jobs not only for individuals living in that state, but also for the people outside their territory.

While, some people believe that learning art subject is a waste of time and money. This essay is in support of former opinion and shall discuss both sides of arguments with reliable illustration before presenting a logical conclusion.\nLately, education gives people knowledge and skills. All subjects are highly important for students and they always try to learn all subjects. These days, art is an essential subject at school because, some students are not interested in studying and they can\u2019t get good marks appropriately, those children learn art in their school time. Learning art is necessary for students because of some reasons. Firstly, art subject including drawing, music,  animation, graphics, artistic design, and computer. When children fill bored that time, they should listen some music and make some paintings on natural beauty. Art is much needed for their Physical growth and the can learn practical life skills such as: teamwork, planning and generate new ideas. Such creative and artistic activities are good and beneficial for students.\nMoreover, learning art is not a waste of money but it\u2019s a needed for students because some students don\u2019t have some skills such as: patients, creativity and many more. If, they learn art than they easily express their love and emotions for their parents by creating a birthday card and some homemade gifts using their creativity. They get relaxation from such creative and artistic activities. Sometimes, some children are interested in make natural beauty paintings so, they should always focus on their paintings and also they make their bright future. \nHowever, art is an unnecessary for students because some parents don\u2019t have more money therefore, their children are studying in big school and their parents pay higher fees than school also teach art such as : music and drawing classes, that's a bad thing and also some parents do hard work and pay higher fees in their child\u2019s school but their children might be wasting their parents money and time. Some children are not interested in art therefore, their class teachers forced to attend art classes. So, children waste their important time in art and they can\u2019t get good result.\nTo conclude, art is important for the child\u2019s growth and they easily learn new important skills and they also make a bright future.

For example, in tropical regions where because of the tundra climate the soil gets frozen so there is no possibility of growing a plant .As a result, individuals  need to depend on animals like fish ,seals and so on.Another reason is that people choose their careers according to the weather .To elaborate, it is commonly seen that when  people live nearby the seas ,they choose fishing as a career or if they live near  Woodlands like Jungles ,they are more likely to choose the carpentry field  to earn money.\n\nOn the other hand, the living conditions of people can be affected by the economy. If the economy of the country is higher then it can overtake weather challenges and can provide basic necessities to its citizens. for example , Dubai is one of the hottest countries but through the fossil fuel ,trade they gained huge wealth. Today most of the Dubai population are leaving luxurious lifetimes.Moreover, developed countries with  good economies have a young workforce or more education systems. if the economy of countries is  good  they can provide better education as well as more people will secure their jobs. therefore , the economy of the country will  increase\n\nTo conclude, although the climate can affect people's food choices or their occupation yet I believe that the economy of the country is  far more crucial."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Environmental pollution has become a threat to mankind. Imposing heavy taxes on fuel consumption for vehicles is considered by few as the most fitting solution to combat these ecological crises. I do not agree with this statement because there are several alternatives to tackle these problems.\n\nTo begin with, increasing the price of petrol will help to reduce  environmental changes to some extent.But it will have perilous impacts on the market of society. Petrolpetrol is an integral part of transportation. Therefore, the high cost of this fuel will not only cause the prices of all essential commodities to increase but also the value of the currency in a particular nation will start depreciating. Moreover, this will lead to inflation and in turn surplus the poverty ratio. For example, in 2019 the cost of all fuels such as petrol and diesel were hiked due to which the economical status of the country was detrimentally degraded.\n\nOn the other hand, the government can take alternative measures to mitigate these issues. Primarily, the usage of renewable resources as a substitute for petrol and diesel will act as a booster to curb  environmental depletion. For instance, biodiesel  is made up of vegetable oils and animal fats and it emits a low level of gases into the atmosphere. This can be widely used in most transportation modes.\n\nSecondly, by improving public transportation and diminishing the amount of travelling, the governing authority can motivate people to use public transport instead of individual cars. These measures can help to keep the climate clean and also reduce traffic congestion.\n\nTo conclude, amplifying the cost of non-renewable fuels is not a feasible option. Instead, improving the efficiency of public transport and investing in renewable energy sources are better alternatives that ought to be considered."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

This essay will examine the main problems of how traffic is affecting people in the cities and towns and we will discuss the possible solutions to this problem.\n\nThe two main problems caused by traffic are rise in private vehicles and pollution. One is that cars have become more affordable for the average consumer, and they are no longer luxury items, consequently, people are using cars to go to their workplace. For example, according to the statistics it takes approximately two to three hours for employees to reach their workspace in metropolis cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. Furthermore, in some cities, like Manila, the public transport facilities are poorly managed therefore people choose to drive their own vehicles. These two reasons for poor traffic management in many places cause unmanageable traffic jams. \n\nHowever, there are several things that the government could do to reduce the trouble. Firstly, the state should provide decent, safe and clean public transportation amenities, then more people would use public transport, instead of personal cars. Secondly, the government should develop new industries and  commercial areas on the outskirts of the city. It is hoped that some public will move to these areas and would reduce the density problem.\n\nIn conclusion, cities and towns all over the world are facing serious traffic problems these days.

In the following essay, I will discuss about both views.\n\nOn the one hand, with the introduction of newer and better versions of current technologies, the older models would become cheaper. For example, almost everyone owns an iron, washing machine or a mobile phone even if they are not the latest models with the best options. Also, due to the internet being accessible everywhere, online shopping facilities, e-learning opportunities and social networking sites have no discrimination and are accessible by both the affluent and the poor and therefore decreases the gap between the wealthy and the poor.\n\nHowever, On the other hand, certain cutting edge innovations may not be available to everyone due to their costs.  For instance, certain medical diagnostic scans like MRI and certain anticancer drugs, as well as organ transplants are very costly and inaccessible to the poor, whereas the wealthy people just have to spend a portion of their income to access these treatments and become healthy. Poor people, nevertheless, have to spend all of their expenses on conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that their condition will improve.\n\nTo conclude, most of the current innovations decrease the gap between the affluent and the poor, while certain developments make society more polarized.

This essay completely agrees with this statement because pollution leads to respiratory diseases and inadequate housing can cause illnesses.\n\nPollution problems are increasing every year. This is because of the activities that humans carry out, more and more diseases are discovered that are linked to air pollution, when the amount of pollution increases, people\u2019s lives in danger rise too, and the most common problems are related to the respiratory system. Recent research concluded that in the last decades, there has been an increase in asthma cases, and many people are getting lung problems, and there are still no solutions for some diseases. \n\nInadequate type of housing can cause health problems for all people who live there. Overcrowding is the biggest problem in most countries, this causes that if one of the individuals that is in the house has an infectious disease the others have a high probability to be infected too. Also, people can get mental health problems, such as psychological stress and sleeping problems, which in the long term period will lead to more serious issues. A recent study found that, more and more people are going to the phycologist because they are having sleeping problems, after studying the cases, the experts concluded that most of them were living with too many people which caused them to be mentally stressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should look for solutions to both pollution and housing problems, so the number of diseases related to these causes can be reduced."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

There are people who think that we are too late to conserve the dying flora and fauna whereas others believe the contrary. I strongly believe that effective steps can be taken to protect these species. This essay will discuss both sides, my opinion followed by a comprehensive conclusion.\n\nTo commence, many would argue that we are too late to protect these species as we have already lost two-thirds of the plants and animals. For example, the population of vultures and leopards is such that it seems impossible to conserve them. Also, many would claim that human development is more important than protecting natural habitats like forests. As a result, we are experiencing further loss of such organisms. Hence, as per this ideology, we should not focus on this issue as it is beyond recovery.\n\nOn the flip side, a part of society argue for protecting these species as it has been achieved in many parts of the world. For instance, the population of tigers doubled in India within a span of two decades. To elaborate further, dedicated protected areas can be built to provide habitats to the forest-dwelling organisms.

In this case, searching for the story behind a house became a popular trend in some countries recently. In this essay, I will offer three main reasons and the method of it in this essay.\n\nFirst of all, it is indisputable that anything with an impressive story is always more fascinated  people than those with nothing. Take a relationship for an example, most people tend to be attracted by mystery women or men having many secrets which always makes others curious. Secondly, because of the development of the Internet, it is more accessible to precious resources of the house or construction in the pre-history period than before.

In this essay, I will describe the reasons for this trend, pros and cons as a consequence of this decision. Firstly I will give examples of possible causes, secondly, I will explain the advantages and disadvantages of this situation. \n\nTo begin with, we live in a very busy lifetime which, is driven by growing expectations from nations and families, focusing on material achievements. We are more stressed and self-absorbed, constantly worrying about our future and careers choices, therefore, we can not afford to have children. Another example which, explains an increasing trend, is the lack of support from the male side, regardless of looking after their offspring. Women are most of the time left with babies at home to provide them with the required care, moreover, ladies spend their time having unpaid housework such as laundry, babysitting, cooking, cleaning. Many females don't want to risk their careers and become housewives.\n\nAdvantages clearly work in favour for women hence, they become independent from their partners and have freedom of choice and get a better education, progress in their chosen profession before they decide to create their families. Furthermore, females can grow in power and become leaders of society, providing peace to this world because they are driven much less by their egos compared to males. However, disadvantages become significant; causing a decreased number of youngsters, for instance, European countries have calculated that soon number of elderly people will reach 60% of all population for that reason we might experience a growing economic problem, lacking people to work for older generation's pensions.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the positive side of this trend outweighs the negative sides, giving more opportunities for better woman's education and jobs.

This is to say that there are many fields such as communication where we can communicate with  people around the world in real-time. Moreover, we can have a face to face conversation, live chat or just speak with the person we want anywhere around the globe. Facebook is the prime example of this where we can talk instantly with our families and friends who are distant apart from us with video sharing option.\n\nFurthermore, new developments in the technology of transportation have made our life comfortable. By ,this I mean innovations in the aviation sector has made our travel time much shorter and more relaxed. For instance, people can reach other countries within hours sitting on a comfortable seat, however, if individuals travel through the road, it will take them days or months. Hence, technology has made out travel faster and deluxe.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the view that technology has made our life complex, this essay believes that it has transformed our lives in an easy and comfortable.

Some individuals believe that global problems have a harmful impact on business and economics in general, while others think that they provide new opportunities for companies' development.\n\n \n\nOn the one hand, negative effects on the agriculture sector from atmosphere fluctuation can be observed nowadays. Heavy rain or no rain for any specific crop caused a bad effect on farming which results in a farmer being poorer.

While some argue that economic growth is the only measure to tackle the global issues of hunger and poverty, I would believe that economic growth which is not sustainable should be stopped.\n\nOn the one hand, those who see economic growth as the sole solution to put an end to hunger and poverty propose several reasons. Firstly, governments with strong finance can allocate resources to develop agriculture. As a result, this would undoubtedly help produce food to sustain the growing population. Secondly, those national authorities would be able to afford to support each and every citizen who is in need. Finally, with the growth of the economy, more and more jobs are created, which could facilitate individuals to earn a living.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a variety of examples supporting the opposing view that economic growth leads to  environmental degradation. In many developing countries, recently a wide range of lowland forests has been cleared and unsustainable agriculture is introduced to produce crops that are valuable to export. In addition, for developed countries, the usage of fossil fuels to provide energy for the growing industrialization can result in global warming. This, consequently, would lead to the rise in sea levels, which might make many poor people homeless.\n\nIn conclusion, I would maintain that economic growth, which is not based on meeting human needs rather than generating profits must be stopped because of its serious damage to the environment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Using phones and the Internet is increasing among people all over the world. While there are some drawbacks associated with entering technology into one's life, I believe that the benefits are more substantial. In the following essay I am going to discuss my view in detail.\n\nOn the one hand, a potential disadvantage of being dependent on the virtual world may be a decrease in the tendency to communicate with others face to face. This causes  isolation from society, for example a sizeable number of people call  their friends or their relevant even parents instead of visiting them.  Another perceived benefit is developing some illnesses like obesity and high blood pressure. The Internet is so widespread and attracts user's attention to navigating different pages for entertainment. which is so time-consuming. As a result, individuals find it difficult to find extra time to  exercise. Therefore, after some years these persons would suffer from fatness.\n\nOn the other hand, a primary advantage of applying phone and social media is that people can keep in contact with others who are far from them easily and cost-effectively.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one\u2019s new country doesn\u2019t mean a loss of their own culture.

I strongly believe the administration employs workers according to their skills, not their scholastic qualifications.

Graduating from an elite University does not guarantee that your first job will give you a six-digit salary. One should be able to apply all the theories he has learned; with this, the company employee evaluators will see if his skill matches his credentials. As a teacher, when I applied for my first teaching job, I underwent an interview process following a written test. I was asked to do a teaching demonstration in front of the other applicants, which tested my skills to the core. Had I not delivered a proper and satisfying demonstration, I would not have continued to explore and expand my skills further. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the association board search for applicants that can perform better than just looking at their inked marks on a piece of paper attesting that they are degree holders.

I absolutely agree with this statement and I will tell you why single-sex education has some negative points. \n\n\tOn the one hand, when boys and girls were separated far from each other in school or any education system, they only see one gender which is the same as themselves. They do not have enough information about how the opposite gender thinks or behaves as the result, in the future they will face problems on their way. For example, Iran's education system is single-sex in school and high school and when students graduate from high school, in university most of them will have a problem with how to behave with the opposite gender and what they have to do when they are with each other. Therefore, many students will mess up in their first appearance in front of the other gender. \n\n\tOn the other hand, both genders can be good and helpful friends to each other. Each has unique abilities that can be useful when they study or in routine life. For instance, most of the time males have more muscle power than females, as the result, when she needs help with mechanic work which needs more muscle power, he can help her or on another side, she can help her friend with his homework. Hence, both genders need each other, it is not a kid's story and slogan to make jokes about each other and call the opposite gender useless or something like that. \n\n\tIn conclusion, each family can decide by their selves which school their sons have to go to, while both education systems have their own positive and negative points. After thoroughly analyzing this subject, in my opinion, the co-educational system is better than it opposite side because I have experience in both of them and know them perfectly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

In my opinion, both news sources have their benefits and are necessary for residents\u2019 life. \n\nOn the one hand, I believe that the press will continue to be an important source of information, even in the Internet age. First, newspaper is the most traditional news media and not everyone wants or can use the Internet instead. For example, older people or people in rural areas may not have the ability or opportunity to access online, while many of us prefer newspapers only even when we have Internet access. Secondly, newspapers can be trusted as a reliable source of news because they employ journalists and professional editors. Finally, many people prefer the experience of holding and reading a piece of paper rather than looking at a computer screen. \n\n\nOn the other hand, that attracts people to read news on online sources is their easy access. With the availability of the Internet all over the world, people with handheld devices like mobile phones can access and search for huge amounts of news. In fact, the latest events, such as corona disease, will be updated immediately for people to take common measures. In contrast, with the manufacturing procedures, traditional newspapers may not be able to compete with the Internet in terms of update speed. \n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the view that newspapers will continue to be the main source of news, because the Internet will soon be equally important."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

There are several aspects to approve as below:\nFirstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.\nSecondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities.

Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China.

So, some people agree with that idea. while, others disagree with that. In this essay i will discuss both sides and i will draw my personal conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, if i agree with that i have some reasons. First of all, the family and friends should do that to make a strong relationship because they will spend over times together. Moreover, they will feel comfortable when they do the skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork because they will do that in some place they love it instead of school. Although, they will be exciting to finish that because they work with people they love them besides, they will have a lot of momert to remember in future.\n\nOn the other hand, also if i disagree with that idea i have a lot of reasons. First, definitely school should focus on academic success and passing examinations but also they should make class for student to learn some skills, if they do that the student will love go to school. In addition, the teachers will have more experience about skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork than family and friends and that will help the students to learn faster. However, the students spend may be 6-7 hoursin per day in school and that making them feel boring but if they practice some skills they will feel great and don't prefer about time they spend it there.\n\nIn conclusion, after analysis both view, I believe that the both of family and school should taught the student the different skills.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\nEssay: In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.\nFirst of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.\nIn fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.\nFurthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.\nOne of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, \"Saudade\" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.\nBesides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.\nLastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.\nTo illustrate this, when talking to the AI \"Siri\" on the iPhone or \"Alexa\" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.\nIn conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison.

Thus, it is believe that providing education for those who are in prison is the best option to obtain crime reduction because they can find a job after being released. I personally do think this solution could only address the problem to some extents. \nOn the one hand, education for prisoner brings a wide range of positive impact on their intellectual. Providing moral and social education could help criminals to understand in depth the value of behaving properly. Furthermore, specific education might help them control their tempers and work well with other people. For example, policer can teach prisoner with different facilitation methods to trigger their negative ideas and then help them to calm down and change the energy into something would not result in any damages. After re-integrating the society, community have a certain understanding of how imprisoners have improved during prisoning time and therefore those of people can get a job to work as normal. \nOn the other hand, receiving an education does not mean they are accepted by society. Vocational education in prison might prepare them skills to make ends meet and they might be able to get a job. However, social stigma is still existed for those who was imprisoned. The stigma and self-stigma, which cannot be controlled by special education for criminals, would lead to re-commit to crime when they are in the real world receiving negative comments. \nIn conclusion, educating prisoners is a great preparation for people to reintegrate into the society but might not be the best way because other solutions such as sensitizing society need to be taken into account."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: It certainly undeniable that importance of schooling is essential in any stage of life. The benefits of learning are obvious as life has become easier and convenient. A growing number of advocates state that, continuing study after finishing college or university is the best way to become gainer in life. However the rest opposes it by saying that it is more preferable to get involve in a job direct after school. Before coming to a resoned conclusion, I will discuss both sides.\n\nOn the one hand there could be a myriad of reasons why some people say that study after college or university can make a difference to create a successful path for career. To begin with, students vast their knowledge in a specific field with studying in a higher education institute, leading to a professional job. A good example to explain this is that every developed countries like Japan, China consist their courses research based after school. By this when their youth continue their study after that they become practical based and professional. Secondly, we need to make our educate experts towards in specialized in specific field. Which will play a vital role in a society's development and the only way to obtain this aim is though higher education. For instance, inventing a cure of coronavirus would be impossible if it's founders never studied after school.\n\nOn the other hand, taking a look at the flip side some might feel that it would be beneficial to start a job after closing school. Academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor or a teacher without having the relevant degree. Besides, no parents would trust teacher without having their professional qualification no matter how experience they are. For this reasons, people looking to build their career in the professions mentioned above.\n\nIn conclusion, having explored both point of view, I think the importance of university of education is determined by the career choices of people . Those who want to pursuing their careers in business or computer programming are better off starting to work fresh out of school or ones willing to become doctors or teachers should complete their relevant courses before their professional lives begin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

Do you think this has more advantages than disadvantages?\nEssay: In today\u2019s modern society, various new employment opportunities make the younger generation change their occupations every few years. Although changing jobs has a certain merit, I am firmly convinced that its demerits are more significant.\n\nOn the one hand, a major benefit when people change their occupations several times is that they can have more experience with many kinds of jobs. This is mainly because during the same time, if they have different jobs, they can obtain more working experiences and skills. Thus, they can discover their potential and passion more easily. For instance, Jenn Im, who is a famous youtuber, had tried many jobs such as writing or teaching before becoming a beauty blogger. Therefore, changing jobs often may bring experiences that staying in one job cannot provide.\n\nOn the other hand, it is my firm belief that there are some drawbacks that cannot be neglected. The first significant drawback is that people do not have enough time to have profound experience. In today\u2019s world of work, a fundamental condition which applies to many positions in a company requires a minimum of 2 or 3 years of experience in the professional field. As a consequence, people who change their job every few years may find it hard to find a decent job. Another major drawback is that employees who change their jobs often may lose non- salary benefits such as health insurance and bonuses. To illustrate this point, in Vietnam, employees can receive an amount of bonus on Tet holiday, but  staff who work for only a few months may not receive that money.\n\nIn conclusion, while changing jobs may help people get more experience and find their favorite work, I personally think that its disadvantages including the lack of profound experience or the loss of non-salary benefits are more significant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

However, some think that the ministry should be taken responsibility to give financial help for elder folks; while others say that the retirement folks should be take care by themselve like savings and insurances. This essay discusses both viewpoints, I strongly agree with the former opinion for the following reasons. \n\nOn the one hand, the governmnet should provide a financial support for old population because they were the once tax payer when they were working and the authority used theirs' money for countrys' infrastructure advancement. Therefore, the ministry should be take care to retirement folks by giving financial support like free medical amenities, minimum amount of monthly pension and discount offer for grocery items. For example, in India gives every month Rs 1000 for theirs' residences who are getting above sixty, as a result, they can manage theirs' expenses. Therefore, the ministry should be provided money related aid for above sixty persons. \n\nOn the other hand, an individual old person should be take care by themselves namely savings and insurances. To be elaborate, they should save a minimum amount of capital for their's old age when they were being young. For instance, in India has strated a new policy of provident fund in companies, especialy in retirement age persons, as a result, they can take this money in after retirement stage. Hence, this way certainly help to an old man can be managed to theirs' expenses. \n\nTo conclude, senior citizens should be take care by the ministry nemely providing money aids and free medical supports; an individual man should be saved a minimum amount of capital for theirs' retirement period.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: Looking at the world it is clear that we are flooded with countless commercials every day. But it is a dilemma whether they bring more harm than good. My perspective is that television ads are useful in general.\n\nTV commercials can positively contribute to the economy in many ways. For enterprises, successful advertisements not only boost sales but also develop brand awareness, loyalty, and preference. For instance, many people were amazed by the presentations made by Steve Jobs. And as a result of Steve's success, Apple is one of the most valuable companies nowadays.\n\nLikewise, for the whole society, appropriate promotions make the local economy more prosperous. The reason behind this is that more consumers are keen on shopping after watching advertisements, which means that more job opportunities must be created by firms to meet the demand. Hence, this is a win-win situation for everybody.\n\nThose who harbour the view that TV ads may have a negative influence on the public may argue that adverts compel people to compete in a material way. Indeed, it is not uncommon to see that many citizens especially teenagers impulsively purchase goods and services that are beyond their purchasing power after watching misleading TV commercials. Nevertheless, the government could shoulder the responsibility and introduce more restrictive laws to prevent misrepresented marketing information, which seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while advertisements could benefit society, they can also make us become superficial shopaholics.

What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it.\nTo study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original.\nBy contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art.\nIn conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

In this essay, I will discuss both sides and will favour the latter view. \n\nOn the one hand, people suggest that offspring should be punished due to their bad behaviours. In this way, they don\u2019t repeat their negative actions. For instance, when a child commits a crime such as  fighting with peers, parents can give punishment to their kid, including a restriction on video games and meeting with peers. When children get these types of penalties, they can understand that their behaviour was wrong, resulting in them tendency to leave these acts behind them. Also, little ones can learn their every negative action has some consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that parents should get penalties due to being role models for their kids. The children spend most of their time with their family members since they are born, and their parents become the main characters in their life. Therefore, kids tend to imitate their father and mother in terms of their behaviours and moral values. For example, if little one sees that his/her dad screams when arguing with other people, they perceive this act as normal, resulting in copying this behaviour. \n\nIn conclusion, although some people claim that children should get penalties because of committing crimes, I believe that parents have a majority of responsibility for their kids\u2019 actions due to be role models in their offspring's life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

Only government action can solve this problem.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Some today argue that only governments are capable of countering problems in cities resulting from housing shortages. In my opinion, although governments should be the primary actors, human beings can also offer aid.\n\nOn the one hand, only governments have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. Governments by design make decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.\n\nHowever, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. People will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform. Governments will ideally enact laws based on the needs of the general populace."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

To what extend do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In past years due to environmental issues that we struggled with some measures were taken such as boosting the oil and fuel price. This was a semi impactful step which is believed by some. However, I think that to solve the environmental problem this measure is not enough.\n\n Money related things better called the monetary system always had an impact on society and people because these days mankind is so dependent on money, so increasing material cost or putting financial pressure on people in order to reduce environmental damage seems to be an achievable purpose. moreover, when fuel cost figures increased not only can we save our world from pollution, but also heavy traffics so it can act as a deterrent to car drivers and force them to use public transportation or clean transportation facilities.\n\n Despite all the great fact that this method brought to the table, there are also some downsides which make this scheme not fully acceptable. It was mentioned in the last paragraph that money is an integral part of our life, but how about the fuel itself, we can barely find a factory which starts without fossil fuel, so when fuel prices are escalating the inflation rises too and inflation results in market disequilibrium. Furthermore, we may witness the disappearance of jobs which associated with fuel such as fuel production and distribution organizations, taxi drivers. Consequently, just by increasing fuel costs, we are not able to tackle ecological damages.\n\n In conclusion, increasing the cost of fuel is an effective way to solve the environmental problem, but if we add something complementary like increasing public awareness about fuel consumption the result is going the be superior to before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

This leads to companies to increase their product diversity and they try to enhance their customer satisfaction. In this way, customers can have a choice of a better product and better purchase. Take some customers, who have some criteria for choosing a product, for example; they can create an attention-grabbing difference in the quality of product as they are picky people. \n\nMoreover, this can provide positive development for the national economy. Advertisement can encourage the economic growth of businesses in many different sectors.This promotion firstly owns companies' improvement economically that can be through attracting more customers and then it contributes to their industries that more money is in circulation as both production and consumption increase. All of these may lead to economic welfare which can increase employment and can create new job opportunities. In this way, the country's economy has benefited from the positive effect of these.\n\nTo conclude, although the increase in advertising may seem bad at first that it becomes more and more popular, it has brought some positive consequences for this to be considered positive development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?\nEssay: It is argued that the large amount of traffic which is occurred in several residential areas has caused significant impacts on daily life. The following essay will throw light on the principal reasons for this problem and bring out a number of methods in which this issue can be tackled. \n\nOne of the most prominent explanations for this phenomenon is that the use of personal transport is overwhelmed because of the need for travelling from people. In particular, everyone has got their own go-to place so ,in order to reach the locations without the dependence on time, the most effective way is by using their own transportations such as car, motorbike or by cycling. Consequently, these measures have led to the common situation which is the traffic jam by having too many private vehicles participating on the road. In addition, another important reason is that the traffic participants don\u2019t follow the rules and the signs during the trip. \n\nTherefore, to resolve the problems above, it is highly recommended that the citizens should take on the public transport services. In detail, the most well-known ones are the local buses, trains and the transportation apps like Grab, Uber, and Bee are nothing strange to modern life thanks to the development of technology. As a result, the road is now clearer to travel because of the reduction in the appearance of personal vehicles. What is more, an effort from the government should be made to create effective travelling policies and initiate a strategy to reconstruct the infrastructure to improve traffic in the future.  \n\nIn conclusion, the overuse of private transport and the lack of obeying the traffic rules have always been the obvious justifications for the rapidity of traffic. However, this can be dealt with by the encouragement of using public transportation and the interference of the government in improving traffic."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

I entirely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have the time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the situation.\n\nThere are a number of measures that governments and individuals could prevent, or at least mitigate climate change. Governments can introduce laws to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide which lead to  climate alteration. They could impose \u201cgreen taxes\u201d on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, or invest in renewable energy, such as solar, wind and water energy. Similarly, as individuals, we can also limit the contribution to the temperature change, by becoming more energy-efficient, less flying, using bicycles and public transportation. Furthermore, the public can take action by voting for politicians who propose to tackle  global warming, rather than for those who prefer to ignore it.\n\nIf instead of taking the above measures, we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. For instance, I am not optimistic that we are able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and jobs, or even worse, they may be forced to migrate to other countries.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\nEssay: In several nations, the amount of citizens who are curious about the history of their accommodations is increasing. One of the reasons for this is that people value the story of objects rather than mere ownership. To know more about the story of their home, they can simply ask their neighbours. \n\nSince the past, society have loved to know the history behind certain things, including buildings. Therefore, they want to know what exactly happened with the building and its surroundings. In addition, certain beliefs even value such information greater. For example, the Fengshui method from Chinese culture wants to know exactly why such a building and its room were built in that manner. If the result was against their customs, they would'nt hesitate to move out and find a better area to live according to Fengshui. \n\nIn order to get information about the history of their house, they need to talk with people around them who already lived there earlier. Moreover, it is obvious that the longer they live in a certain place, the more knowledgeable they are on telling what has been changed about the place.

Authorities say that it is possible that artifical intelligence could take over human tasks in the coming decade. Despite this replacement seems to be a good idea, it also has its drawbacks. I am going to give my opinions below.\n\nIt is appearent that the birth of robots has great contrtibutions to financial plans of governments. In the field of manufacturing, robots could potentially reduce labour costs in the long run, as they do not require salaries, benefits, or other ongoing expenses associated with human employees. Although there are maintanance costs, they can be offset by increased productivity and reduced human workforce requirements. Addition to this, the product quality would be under control thanks to robots. They could consistently perform tasks with high precision and accuracy during manufacturing processes. Moreover, artifical intelligence entities could minimize errors, reduce variability, and enhance product consistency, resulting in higher-quality products. In the future, I believe, robots will have more significant contributions to other aspects of society. \n\nOn the other hand, the appearence of robots does have its negative influences on employees. One of the major concern is that the widespread use of robots may lead to considerable job losses for humans. They take over tasks previously performed by humans, as a result, unemployment rates may rise, causing socio-economic challenges and income inequality. Despite advancements in robotics, there are still limitations and risks to consider. Robots may encounter difficulties when facing complex, unpredictable situations which require adaptability, flexibility and decision-making. \n\nIn conclusion, it is important to notice that the impact of robots on the job market and society is a complex and multifaceted issue.

In my opinion, though self-care promotes a culture of saving, it is government\u2019s duty to ensure part of their welfare and health with financial support.\n\nPeople who are opposed to government financial support are of the opinion that, the culture of saving rather than depending on the government may boost the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government, as a result, the government would be able to plan more funds for more productive purposes such as, development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which might expedite the overall enhancement of a country.\n\nAlthough I recognize the legitimate merits to the argument above, I would generally side with those who believe the government should allocate part of its budget as a repayment to financial support of retirees in order to provide welfare and comfort. As retirees age, those suffering from various disease including, Parkinson, diabetes and osteoporosis, become more needy of monthly checkup. If their health is taken into consideration, the government should provide them more comprehensive financing assistance, like health insurance, cheaper loans and expenses of care and nursing. on the other hand, it is said that all individuals are paying taxes for years because of their civic duty and in contrast the government duty is included giving financial support when needed especially after retirement.\n\nIn conclusion\u060c although some believe that it is retirees\u2019 duty to take care of themselves, others think government should shoulders the responsibility of retirement finance.

In other words, high school children help their institutes to improve the quality of education provided that they notified the school management about different aspects of a tutor, such as cooperativeness, punctuality, understanding, to name but a few. For example, Singapore has improved its education standard remarkably by assessing tutors from high school students\u2019 evaluation sheets. Therefore, pupils of high school should be inspired to criticize their professors effectively in order to increase their education quality.\n\nPlausible though pupils of secondary schools have the ability to understand right and wrong, and to judge other people, it is worth arguing that they should not evaluate their supervisors' performance. This is because it is a way to show disrespect and angriness to professors.

There are numerous motives for their action and several ways to achieve this, which will be illustrated in this essay.\n\nTo commence with, it is true that there are a plethora of rational reasons for this trend. The primary reason is that the house owner might come across a detail of the house that is bizarre or something they have never encountered before, which makes them curious. As a result, they start to do research about that detail and eventually find the information about their living space. Another reason is that historical documentaries and films influenced people to be immersed in finding the history of their home and their surroundings.

Therefore, ahead of my stance, both the viewpoints would be discussed.\n\nExamining the former opinion, the first argument the proponents put forward is that Scientists bring about revolutionary innovations. In other words, the intellectuals from this fraternity have been responsible for all the groundbreaking discoveries and inventions in the history of mankind such as Telephone, Internet, and Computers. This has had an immense influence on the general public and their standard of living leading to a convenient and hassle-free life. Moreover,  technological advancement is attributed to the scientist.

How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?\nEssay: Competitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals. This essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency.\nThere are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people. The most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success. Such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results. Apart from that, another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition, especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard-earned victories. Such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction. Even if losing the competition, people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus, encourages them to work harder.\nAs far as I am concerned, I opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon, because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress, but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated.\nTo sum up, the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder, and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals.

From  prior experience, this writer argues that living conditions have a precise impact on human beings due to the socio-economic environment and adverse childhood. \n\nIt is vital to understand that people who live in disadvantaged conditions are more likely to commit a crime. Not far from the fact those who grow up in  deprived neighbourhoods are simply come across with villainous activities. This may turn to a crime as a way to make ends meet.

Hence, it can not be claimed that a criminal is the product of a destructive character.\n\nIn the writer's opinion, surrounded by a community that potentially commits crimes surely makes the crowd to be potential offenders, especially in  human childhood.

I completely disagree with this statement, because it is possible to prevent environmental damage by negotiating with society which have great influence and finding a solution.\n\nTo begin, there are plenty of public that are the main source of some vital fossil fuels or minerals. By manufacturing these kind of materials, they are causing  land and ocean deterioration that are also affecting many species. However, apart from developing region, there are some reasons for damaging the environment. For example, citizens of poor community don't own private bins or don't have educational lessons about where litter can be tossed. Consequently, they are spreading rubbish around them and increasing the amount of distributed waste.\n\nSecondly, we can avoid infection disasters with just a few straightforward rules. If people commence throwing out the trash to the special bins and collect spread waste in the surroundings, we will be able to the win fight against natural damage. Furthermore, scientists are trying to discover new ideas on how to solve environmental problems and there are several successful inventions. For instance, scientists say that if we reduce the production of carbon dioxide, it is possible to overcome climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, all aforementioned points illustrate that running countries in a developing process has a great impact on natural abuse, but there are more crucial measures that we have to embrace for the future of the world."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree? You should write at least 254 words.\nEssay: It's argued that doing group sports activities could be tools for youngsters to interact with each other. I fondly agree with this notion because this can be applied easily and the rest of the issues will be elaborated on in this following paragraph. \n\nOn the one hand, children nowadays are encouraged to have active life through some activities such as joining clubs to playing games together. The main aim is to educate them to be able to socialize, share, care and lean on each other as a team. For instance, a student who joins basketball team tend to have many friends and when they are in trouble it is easy for them to ask for help. Thus, get involved in school activities becomes an effective way to educate children to learn about themselves as a community. \n\non the other hand, other benefits could find in the way they learn how to communicate with each other, especially when they have a chance to be a leader. With this capacity, they could act as a captain lead the team, set the goal, and find a solution for a problem.

Firstly, by working, students become more mature, as they can live independently on their own income. In addition, students can learn how to manage their budgets and save money. Secondly, when students experience various workplaces, they have a chance to acquire more skills and experience. Because of this,  they can put the knowledge gained from previous employment into practice and receive recognition for their capabilities. Moreover, by doing different jobs, young people can find what suits them best and make their career choices better.\n\nHowever,  students should pursue higher education. The first reason is that a worker with a degree can meet higher qualifications, which employers tend to expect. Moreover, in Vietnam, an engineer is more highly paid and have more chances to move up their career ladder than a manual worker. Another reason is that the job market is becoming competitive over the world, as hundreds of applicants chase the top jobs. Thus, having a degree is an advantage for students, as it not only helps graduates to have an easy time finding a job but also reach the top in their chosen careers in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, while getting a job after graduation may have its own benefits, I think that students should go to  university to pursue higher education."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

Generally, only one-fifth of the women can hold the career in the technical domain/technical domains. The problems faced by females to get employment or be sustained in technical area and its solutions will be discussed in the following text. \n\nThe foremost problem caused by the ladies is the gender discrimination. Inequality due to gender, although illegal, exist prominently in many tech companies and does not allow females to work independently. In addition to this, lack of assistance and understanding is another major issue faced by most of them. The mindset of masculine stereotypes is that the women should do the job like nursing and teaching which suits to their basic nature and do not provide their support for the ones who opt for techy jobs.\n\nA possible solution to this problem would be to erase gender-based attitude from a company\u2019s culture. Reinforcing the healthy attitude towards women by every individual of the company can help to overcome this problem. Secondly, the support of people in woman's life is extremely necessary. Aiding in the form of selecting subjects in school and choosing jobs in the industry should be their own evaluation instead of any forceful decision. For example, a recent report published in the Guardian shows that there has been increase in the 20% of females opting for technical jobs from the last two years.\n\nIn conclusion, females can opt for the techie jobs more if gender discrimination has been reduced and encouragement  from the families and coworkers can be enhanced.

Discuss both view and give your opinion.\nEssay: It is said that climate has a huge impact on our lives while others think that this effect is caused by the economy. I believe that the economy is the most contributing factor as the climate can be controlled by the business. \n\nOn the one hand, some see that climate is the most contributing factor to our lives because the availability of natural resources depends on food, water and energy. For example, people who live near the desert have trouble with water shortages. Moreover, people's lifestyles are also impacted due to the weather they live in. For instance, clothing, houses and food. In addition, the profession in the cold weather is different from the hot climate. It can be seen that people living in tropical weather export more rice than in cold weather nations. Therefore, climate change has an impact on individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, the economy plays a vital role in our daily lives. When the economy has improved people's buying decisions change. Take buying a mobile phone as an example, people in good economy countries use iPhones as their daily necessary items whereas people in poor economy countries do not have mobile or buy  cheap Chinese mobile phones. Similarly, people in rich nations become more educated compared to poor nations. \n\nI believe that the economy is more important than the climate. It is because people can change the climate when a country has a better income. For example, China converted the desert into fertile land with huge government funding because they have a good economy. As a result of this, people living in these places are improved.  Therefore, the economy has more impact on us.\n\nTo sum up, both economy and climate have an impact on our daily lives, however; I am now clear that having a good economy can almost change everything including climate which leads to improving our lifestyles."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

The ideas to clarify these views will be illustrated in this essay below.\n\nTo begin with the first reason that why qualification is necessary. Knowledge could be seem as the background and it is easier to train to a person who already have basic insight in certain field to match the job requirment. Therefore, the company can retain money and time on training . Beside, after training course, the company also has more advanced employees.The secondly reason that qualification can evidence that people has spent a long time in training. They have a lot of practice experience and have been trained to have a professional working attitude so it will be easier to work and interact with them.So that, when the boss has an important mission to entrust,they might be the person that boss trusts with tasks without worrying.\n\nIn addition, social skills are also necessary when looking a employment . You can not develop completely your caree without social skills . If a person only learns proffesion knowledge without interactions and communication. Good communication can create sympathy for your boss and colleagues. For example, an worker can create sympathy for customers thanks to skillful speaking.

It has been argued by many whether this is a positive step or not. I, personally think it has more demerits as it increases stress and anxiety and also leads to many health problems. This essay will discuss both  sides and further state a strong reason why the negatives outweigh the positives.\n\nOn one hand, Due to excessive competition in the corporate sector, women tend to conceive later in their life. This could be because it brings financial stability and maturity to handle a baby with care. For example, a survey in the London time shows a considerable amount of females prefer to give birth when they are in their thirties. Therefore, it helps them to enjoy themselves before bringing a big responsibility to the world.\n\nOn the other hand, with the positives, one cannot neglect the negatives it offers. The first and foremost is the stress a lady has to go through when they have babies late. In other words, females tend to become weak after the age of thirty and suffer from different kinds of anxieties. For instance, in the United Kingdom, 90% of women suffer from psychological issues if they conceive after the required age. This further leads to many health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, it is inevitable to say there is no appropriate time to bring a soul into this world, but bringing them at a stake of hampering your health would be a wrong decision to make.

Why do people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?\nEssay: To some people in certain parts of the world, having some understanding of their own family tree is becoming an ongoing trend. In my opinion, there are certified reasons behind this, and even with some concern about this idea being adverse, it is undoubtedly a positive development. \n\nThe key rationale behind this might be that some individuals are eager to see their relatives again after being separated for a long time. For example, some families had to scatter to places for years to avoid wars or internal conflicts in their countries, in order to ensure their survival. By knowing about the background of the families, people might track back to their roots and find their distant cousins who might still remain in this area. Another cause leading to this trend stems from the fact that some people are determined to rediscover family secrets that have faded after centuries. For instance, some families might have a royal background; nevertheless, they lost their statuses for unknown reasons. Hence, if the history of the family is thoroughly analysed, the descendants might regain the respect and dignity that their ancestors once had. \n\nEven with the controversy surrounding this trend, I concur that this trend can be advantageous. Regarding the individual aspect, having a profound knowledge of his family tree would be of great assistance to the enjoyment of studying history, which is vital for countries that put an emphasis on this subject. In addition, one boasting sufficient details about his family can utilise some of the stories from the past to write journals or historical documentaries, all of which might become valuable assets to pass down to the next generation. Some might worry that this act would unveil some notorious stories of a plethora of respectable names in the past, which might be damaging to their stature; nonetheless, I reckon this would help the mass to have a more comprehensive view of their own predecessors. \n\nTo conclude, in view of the desire to reunite with long-lost family members and to reveal some secrets of their family names, some people are researching the history of their families meticulously, which I think is beneficial.

But there is a solution to every problem and tech companies should be more open minded and flexible towards women's participation in the technological sector. \n\nThere is no doubt that women tend to be better off, when it comes to managing work and personal life. And, one of the major reasons for less women entering in tech jobs is because of the poor work life balance. As many technical positions require long working hours and even working at client sites.

I will explain the causes one by one in this essay.\n\nFirstly, in this technology era, many schools have made it compulsory that they will electronics as a teaching medium. Consequently, parents were forced to buy pads, laptops or mobile phones for their kids. Having access to gadgets at such small age, teenagers get easily influenced by things shown on the internet. It has been seen that many students get addicted to video games and play them with their friends till late at night. As they don't get sufficient sleep, it becomes really difficult for them to pay attention at school. At teenage, ,,generally people have an urge to get popular at the institute. Consequently, girls get trapped in social media apps. For example, a cousin of mine is an Instagram influencer. Due to the algorithm of insta, she has to post a picture or video daily to remain active and to not lose followers. This has impacted her grades in a bizarre manner.\n\nSecondly, in this competitive world, couples want their child to be an all-rounder. Furthermore, they want him or her to do extraordinary tasks in every field. As a result, it becomes burdensome for their offspring to focus on sports as well as on education simultaneously. For instance, my childhood friend is a great football player. Moreover,he even participates at the state and national levels. As he has to attend competitions and got to travel to many places, he doesn't get enough time to study. His forerunners and teachers pressurized him a lot to pay attention to his schooling also.\n\nTo conclude, i would like to reiterate my statement that there are many aspects to the problem as discussed above due to which pupils face issues to get good grades.

While it is possible for mundane work to be carried out by robots, I believe certain jobs requiring human touch will still be performed by people. This essay will discuss some of the tasks that will and will not be taken over by automation.\n\nDue to robots' precision ability, they have the capacity to carry out unskilled work. In production, the use of machines has helped companies to cut costs, save time and increase profitability across many industries. For instance, in the electronic industry, microchips are pre-dominantly assembled by machines for many years and can hardly be seen involving human labour. This is because the line of work usually involves a high level of precision and speed which people may not be able to keep up with. Furthermore, some other industries that automation can potentially take over include the military, as well as food and beverages.\n\nAlthough machines are programmed to be highly intelligent, certain tasks requiring human skills, such as mental intelligence and human interaction cannot be performed by them. For example, doctors and surgeons are positions that can only be carried by highly-trained individuals. While machines can be precise in how they operate, they are unable to interact with patients or account for the patients' feedback during a doctor's appointment session. As a result, misdiagnosis can happen and is detrimental to the patients. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the use of robots will increase significantly to increase productivity in the future, human intervention in certain areas is still essential to ensure adequate human interaction.

It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.\nThis has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.\nFor example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.\nClassical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Recently, there has been a contentious polemic about whether people should stave atmospheric conditions off or live with them. From my perspective, climate transition is a natural activity of Terra that should be embraced rather than controlled. In the following paragraphs, I will postulate some judgments bolstering my view.\n\nTo begin with, the originality of climate variation itself is based on the natural way of Mother Nature to preserve its richness. There must be devout reasons for every seasonal shift in terms of how the environment and natural resources will adapt. For instance, several crops rely on rainy seasons to produce fruits. On the contrary, a plethora of vegetation's growth phases rely on the autumn season. These are merely the illustrations of plantations, yet, imagine a myriad of creatures relying on the weather rhythms such as animals, birds, beaches, or even fungi and bacteria.\n\nConsequently, societies have unconsciously adapted to it since countless centuries ago as humans depend on natural resources to make a living. Take the example of rainy seasons that help farmers cultivate their crops and, subsequently, be able to feed their households. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the rainy season can become a setback to running an event for some organizers or even flood disasters if it drops excessively. Perhaps, previous examples of detrimental ramifications are the underlying considerations on why some communities aspire to control the weather. Nevertheless, technological advancement has enabled experts to forecast the weather and disseminate the projection overtly through our mobile phones.\n\nIn conclusion, the origin of each season is a paramount blessing from Mother Nature for its creations and society as every climate is meticulously designed for specific causes. Therefore, I strongly oppose the proponents who want to deter this natural rhythm. At the end of the day, we humans should find avenues to make the most out of it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Some people belive that teaching kids about the subject science of food and how to prepare it properly in the school would be a benificial, while others argue there are other important subject to study, so it's a waste of time. Although other necessary subjects are support to make the better career, science of food helps them to stay in the healthy liestyle as well as epand their lifespan. In my opinion,school should provide knowledge to the kids about food.\n\nFirstly, Parents push their kids to get high marks in other essential subject to place the high-paid job. Many reputed companies hire their employees who get more knowledge and skills in the core subjects, therefore, familes trained their kids to get high marks in important subjects because of their future career. For instance, Most of the IT industries in India are expecting more coding knowledge from the employees as well as they don't care about the other skills. because of making better future to their children parents may don't want to waste the kids time to study unwanted subjects.\n\nHowever, Healthy life style makes the person life better.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving occupation, whereas others assert that entering the workforce right after high school is a better option. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding I am favour of the former notion.\n\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why graduates tend to be workers after graduating from high school could be advantageous to  a certain extent. First and foremost, a variety of young people making this decision could become more mature and independent. For example, students who are not good at academic learning might want to make money as soon as possible, which could help them easily pay for various costs of living, such as accommodation, food, and bills, without depending on their families. Furthermore, individuals who work early are very likely to become business owners. This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that various elements affect pupils studying further. One reason is that this choice guarantees a bright future. For instance, in Vietnam, the only way to become professional employees, such as doctors, lawyers, or engineers, who often achieve a decent salary and are respected by all walks of life, is to have certificates that prove their qualifications. Another reason is that bachelor's degree holders could be more advantageous in finding a well-earned position in an immensely competitive market. In fact, employers in major corporations, such as Google or Apple, often prioritize recruiting applicants with a bachelor's degree, so that university graduates are more likely to successfully apply to these companies.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

Meanwhile, some people said that art as much crucial as any other subjectsuch as science or economics. This essay will talk both points of view followed by reasons and examples.\n\nTo begin with, art knowledge encourage the creativity and the emotional development for childern. Take it for example, paint and music. Paint is allowed people to gain is inspiration in almost everything even when it is not a huge topic. Therefore, in art class the creativity of the youth is forced to be developed wisely so that they may sucsess to make a painting. For instance, music is the part of emotional development that produced from all of over the class journey. It develop from the practice of playing music until they can play music properly and enjoy playing some songs. In addition, music such as piano for example can help people in all ages to calm and relax, or in the other words, provides better emotional control.\n\nOn the other hand, a number of people have said subject such as science, economics or language is more vital than art or sport. It relays on opinions that in the future the need of knowledge on those subject quite unnecessary. For example, many sucsessful people work on either science or bussiness, and if it include art or sport, they have to be super talented or have previledge to be noticed in art industries. So that, parents, undenyingly, direct their childern to avoid those kind of job and choose common job to have a promising future even though their kid is actually have talent on them. Hence, the capability of playing music that children gain for school is often unuseful in their long-term future.\n\nTo sum up, art is an important subject because it encourage the creativity and help to develop emotional aspect of children, however in long-term point of view it might be unuseful to get an occupation for most of people, unless the have a previldge or extremely talented."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

Although it is argued by some people that it is too late to take any action on this problem, I hold the opinion that we can still adopt effective measures to improve this situation.\n\nSome people believe that the negative impact that humans have exerted over the ecological system is irreversible. Thus little outcome can be seen if action is taken from now on. For example, the breakthroughs that humans have achieved in genetic science cannot bring extinct species back to life. Moreover, genetically modified organisms might affect biodiversity, and the possible knock-on effect is yet to be foreseen. In this case, the action that aims to protect the species is neglectable. \n\nHowever, I would argue that effective and timely measures are pivotal in protecting plants and animal species from further harm. If people stop burning coal and fossil fuels and alter to renewable energy, then we are more likely to avert global temperature rising up to an unprecedented level, and more species are able to survive because of that. If we start enhancing people's awareness of protecting wildlife, then communities are more likely to work collaboratively in to conserving endangered species.

This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon, and also the possible solutions.\n\nThere are two main reasons related to the impact of production to the environment. One of these is because of the lack of environmental regulations to protect the nature. It is well known that our rules do not support all aspects related to the damage caused by production in large scale. For instance, there are numerous industries in S\u00e3o Paulo that through their gabage in the river, and nothing happens. Furthermore, the industries do not invest in developing new technologies to make their processes more efficient, and more environmental friendly.\n\nHowever, there are solutions to this issue. Firstly, the government should apply more taxes to those companies that do not respect environmental regulations. For example, the rules applied in Brazil are too soft when compared to developed countries like Canada. Another important point is that we should have more aducation actions focused on environmental solutions that would make our industrial process greener. For instance, universities should invest in researches to increase the manufacturing efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the absence of laws and regulations to protect the nature against the impact of production, and also the lack of technology to improve efficiency, are the key aspects of the problem.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nEssay: Schools have long played a significant role in bringing children for the future, not only by providing academic background but also by teaching moral and ethical standards. Nowadays, there is a growing concern that schools are only concerned with preparing students to serve their country rather than encouraging individual growth. However, I would argue that schools play a crucial role in developing pupils into unique individuals and allowing them to reveal their passion.\n\nOne apparent distinction between schools and colleges and universities is a broader scope of taught subjects. Schools purposely expose their pupils to a variety of areas, such as biology, engineering, sports and chemistry, to encourage pupils to reveal their true passion. They provide a testing ground where students develop a unique worldview and unfold their future goals. Thus, schools give an opportunity to select a custom path for a person rather than dictating to them their future direction.\n\nHowever, some people believe that since public schools are under the charge of governments, they can be imposed specific policies, educational standards and rules from high authorities. For example, a government may force schools to propagate a sense of patriotism to bind children into their countries. Nevertheless, such alternations do not disturb the teaching of the main subjects. Even when specific additional courses are imposed, children will still have an opportunity to study their primary subjects and engage in fields they are most interested.\n\nIn a nutshell, many people think that schools only prepare students to become professionals and citizens who serve their country, but I believe that schools also provide an opportunity for each individual to develop their own worldview and determine their ultimate goals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

This essay strongly agrees with this suggestion for several reasons.\n\nThe first argument given to support my idea is that legal power of the government. This arises from the fact that the government plays an important role in order to ensure a life of their people. Mainly because there are various situation which can not be solved by citizens, and also rules are just given by the government to organise a country. For instance, the government can introduce high taxes of owning properties, so that houses are left for people who have low income.\n\nAnother point behind my belief is rules and policies of the government. There are efficent policies introduced by the government to assist residents who have housing problems. For example, introducing an economy rules or policies in companies to make sure that people can have adequate income to cover their life. As a result, the issue of less houses will become better. \n\nIn conclusion, I totally agree that actions of the government can solve housing shortage issue given the aforementioned arguments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<4"}]}

But, nowadays, the number of Television channels are rapidly increased. Because of this, humans are in real confusion to choose the one to watch. Along with this, the quality of these broadcast are still debetable. In my view, it is good to have more choices but, all channels should promise about the quality of telecast also. This essay will examine the topic in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, because of the arrival of dish antenna now persons are more accessible to opt the channel according to their wish. Moreover, plenty of telecasts satisfy their selection. Besides this, youngsters are getting plethora of chances to express their talents through competitive shows. For example, a study conducted by Banaras Hindu University, India proved that present generation is getting more options to share their ideas than in the past one. To summarize, more channels bring more opportunities to children as well as lots of choices to adults.\n\nOn the contrary, there are unnecessary competitions going on between channels. However, same kind of play telecast by two different channels will affect the quality of the program. Apart from this, people may get bored easily by watching same kind of repeated broadcast.

These communities are generally divided into two big parts one of which, is the sufficient number of big cities that are experiencing shortages of places to live. I totally agree with some, who believe that governments should take a series of actions to overcome this problem. \n\nTo begin with, with the advent of technology, the population is migrating from rural areas to  economically stronger cities and in most cases, the reason for that is not their interest in bleeding-edge applications. For example, people in villages or in less organized infrastructural places are relocating for better jobs, living standards and education. When the governments concentrate their all attention on building new working places, educational institutions and governmental establishments in some areas of the country, they lead other parts of their region to economic regression. Therefore, particular cities are overpopulating and environmentally damaging. \n\nOn the other hand, it might seem not clear, but the main source of this kind of issue is the dishonesty of government workers who are corrupted by dictators at the top of the country. Unfortunately, average citizens should have to obey  these strict rules despite the threat to their lives. As a result, many people are ready to live in the small corner of megapolises, in order to get a job as a cheap working force to earn some money in their homelands. In some cases, even they have to leave their borders and relocate to developed regions for a better life. A good example of this might be countries of far Eastern and African countries, where  personal interest and civil wars are highly exceeded. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe, that the problems like house shortage in a particular part of the world are directly related to the government's attitude in their areas.

A section of society believes that this can be beneficial for both the youngsters and the society. I fully agree with the given statement, and then my opinion will be discussed in the following paragraphs along with  suitable examples. \n\nTo commence with, if the teenagers work without salaries for the welfare of society, then it will definitely have numerous benefits for them. Firstly, their spare time will be utilized in a productive and effective manner. Moreover, they will also learn many important lessons which will be required for them in later life. For example, a survey from Oxford University in 2019, stated that the children who had worked as unpaid social activists were more confident and knew how to deal with a different mindset of people which would be helpful to them when they apply for a job. Hence, it will be beneficial for younger people to get some life experiences before doing a job.\n\nMoving further, these types of social activities from teenagers are also helpful for the community as well as there is a number of people who want help but  do not have any source and money to get it.

Personally, I completely agree with this opinion and this essay will elaborate on several reasons why increasing the cost of fuel is able to save the Earth from environmental problems.\n\nFirstly, Higher fuel prices will force people to switch to environmentally friendly transportation mode. As travel by private vehicles such as cars or motorcycles become more expensive, people that work in nearby offices from their home will tend to commute by foot or bicycles to save more money. Similarly, employees that work in offices located far away from their home will shift to public transportation like buses or trains. As a result, less and less emission is produced from commuting, which will save the world from climate changes.\n\nSecondly, the higher cost of aviation fuel makes travel by plane more expensive than previously. Planes emit a lot of pollution that leads to warmer Earth temperature, but many people prefer using planes even for short distance travels that are accessible for land mode transportation. It means people can use green transportation mode like electric trains and cars that are able to get electricity from solar panels. Expensive plane tickets will make people tend to use these electric transportation for short distance trips. Resulting in less pollution emitted from planes to the atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that expensive fuel will save our Earth from environmental problems.

I think this type of case is becoming popular due to the person's belief in energy.

Since they believe the spirit of the former owner can stay in the apartment, it is an important aspect besides  the quality of the building and other facilities. For example, in many countries including Mongolia, people do not buy an apartment that is related to crimes, such as murder or domestic abuse, as they think the bad spirit of those scenes can be transferred to the new owner. Therefore, purchasers pay attention to the histories behind flats even if the prices are relevantly low. \n\nFinding out the information about the old days of the house is a tough task but not impossible. The easiest way to conduct research is by asking  neighbours ,especially elderly ones about the previous residents. Another method is collecting archive information about the house from the internet or the police whether it has a criminal record or any special cases that need consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, people are extremely interested in what happened in the past  their accommodations which affect their purchasing behaviour of buildings.

While some people believe that the length of the duration spent watching them that has a significant impact on children. In my opinion, it is the content of the program that has a more marked influence on their behaviour.\n\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why watching Television for long periods of time has negative effects on the development of children both  physically and psychologically. Firstly, children are exposed to intermittent flashes of light from the television, this could cause serious damage to the eyes. As a result, it can cause temporary blindness if children watch Television excessively. For example,  when children keep their eyes glued to screens for several hours, waves from the television may cause a headache, even this can significantly increase the risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. Secondly, the enormous amounts of duration are spent wastefully for electronic devices by young viewers instead it should be used in more useful activities like reading, exercise and interacting with friends or their relatives. All of the activities are crucial for a healthy lifestyle. For instance, When children watch television excessively, they are less likely to be spending time developing social skills. To finish, the productivity of group work will be decreased if the lack of communication skill.\n\nOn the other hand, it is the broadcasted images that have the most direct effects on young viewers. In other words, children are easily manipulated by the adverts which take them to the virtual world. In view of the fact, which coax them to purchase products that are not always worth their money. To illustrate, Since 2010, toys of the Star Wars series are very popular among teenagers and sales of these toys are very high in the market. In addition, the advertisements are delivered in such a way that children start pestering their parents to buy those products. To give a clear example, the fast food chain McDonald\u2019s promote their Ads to attract more and more teenagers to eat fast food which is not good for health because  it contains high levels of fats and cholesterol which cause obesity and diabetes in children.Thus, these adverts should not be allowed to be shown in mass media\n\nIn conclusion, though both two factors have their own implications, I believe that the content is more considerable. Hence, parental intervention is essential in controlling children's TV viewing habits and awareness of children about programs with a healthy mind."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In today's topic, few people believe that the adolescent group should do their part for the community in the meantime without getting paid. As well they do trust that it will benefit them and society. In my opinion, I agree that teenagers taking part in volunteering will help in their personal growth. \n\nOne of the main reasons, why a kid should volunteer is to develop their social skills and to gain experience. For ,instance A student who is involved in social work gets to generate many contacts and their exposure will be high compared to other persons. Nowadays many companies look for Extracurricular activities in the CV section, in that ,way this skill will give added benefit to teenagers. Between they can also develop their communication skill to the next level by meeting a new human.\n\nFurthermore, young person impact volunteering will have major advantages in  society, Like helping  people in the slum area for studies and also  supporting the animal campaign. For example: In general, teens have a habit of tutoring others , while doing this in a place where the human can't afford will benefit in both ways and illiteracy will be avoided in our society upto a bit. Whereas students should also create  awareness about abusing animals in their community, to avoid them as much as in further because young voices are extremely important as they are our future who rule our country. I can believe that there are many advantages to this statement compared to disadvantages.\n\nIn conclusion, youngsters should volunteer in order to develop their social skills and to get work experience.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: The need for international cooperation to resolve urgent problems is debatable. Almost all urgent problems can be resolved with international cooperation. This essay will talk about the need for international cooperation in order to resolve urgent problems.\n\nInternational cooperation is efficient in resolving urgent problems. Countries with low problem solving skills can depend on first world countries for help. Advanced countries always have an upper hand in resolving problems, rather than one country working on its own. For example, the United Kingdom was able to help Lebanon in resolving its civil war in the year 1987, and it also ended the civil war in Lebanon. The cooperation between the two countries in resolving an urgent issue is more efficient than one country working on its own.\n\nIn addition, the cooperation between two world countries is time saving. If two world countries come together, it would take less time than one country trying to resolve the problem on its own. Furthermore, both country's resources combined to combat the problem would take less time than one country working on its own. For example, during world war one, the cooperation of multiple countries in an effort to end the war lead to the end of world war one in less than a year. Working together as two countries or more always take less time than one country try to resolve a problem on its own.\n\nIn conclusion, the effort and time spent on resolving a problem by two or more countries are far more superior than one country trying to resolve an urgent problem on its own.

From my point of view, financial assistance should be given to in-need people, regardless of geographical barriers.\n\nOn the one hand, some who object to the idea of supporting impoverished people worldwide have their own justifications. First, it cannot be denied that a large amount of money donation comes from local people or overseas nationals, therefore, the government should give aid to needy compatriots. For example, with the catastrophic consequences that Storm Goni left, a major volume of remittances from overseas Vietnamese to the country to remedy these problems, therefore, it would be used for locals who were disastrously affected by the typhoon. Moreover, the authorities should give support to their dwellers in far-flung areas to improve their life quality as well as promote the local economy.\n\nOn the other hand, I concur with the view of giving financial assistance to in-need people, despite their geographical locations. First, it helps the government build up a harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship with other countries. This collaboration enables the recipient country to reach its potential while the benefactor can enjoy certain trade benefits. Furthermore, evidently, people in underdeveloped nations suffer from more pressing issues than their counterparts in developed ones, as a result, they need support from global organizations to overcome the problems such as hungry or illiteracy.\n\nIn conclusion, it is understandable that individuals have their own perception, however, I am firmly convinced that the main purpose of charity funds should be to assist needy people, no matter where they live."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

However, If nobody force this young people to take social responsibilies on daily lifes, children get used to be selfish, anti-social and narrow-minded.

In my opinion, the advantages of a gap year, both personally and professionally, outweigh the disadvantages, like the delay to begin a career.\n\nThere are several benefits to going travelling or working before choosing a major. The main one is the opportunity for one to explore various occupations before initiating their studies in order to find out what truly interests them and what do not. This reduces the chances of disappointment in the future when beginning their careers. Furthermore, these professionals tend to be more qualified and successful because of the interest they have in their field of study.\n\nAnother immense positive outcome of a gap year is personal growth. Most people do not understand the importance of getting to know different cultures and lifestyles until they do. This is probably the most enriching experience in life since it teaches them to respect and admire the diversity in the world, which is a game-changer nowadays.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also drawbacks.

However, some folks think that they should accept this change rather than stopping it. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this opinion.\n\nFirstly, we should create awareness among the people to grow more and more trees. Consequently, this lush green beauty helps in controlling the increasing temperature on the earth. As trees are considered to be the best absorbent of hazardous carbon dioxide gas. For example, countries covered with the healthy green environment are merely prone to the climatic change.\n\nSecondly, the government should step forward and make some stringent rules to lower down the pollution emitted from the vehicle as well as from the factories. As this pollution is depleting our ozone layer which directly impacts the climate. Furthermore, this layer is responsible for saving our planet from the heat of the sun. Thus, use of electric vehicles and alternative fuels should be encouraged to deal with climate change. For instance, people of countries like the Netherlands after adopting electric technology are enjoying the salubrious and pleasant climate. \n\nIf instead of taking the above measures we simply continue to live with the climate change the consequence will be disastrous. Natural resources like water and more should start depleting due to change changes in the climate. Additionally, frequent flood will be noticed in the low lying areas due to rising temperature. Hence it causes many pernicious diseases.

In some countries, the government pays more attention to the arts, and some people think this is a positive trend, but others believe that money should be spent on  alternative areas, such as health, or education. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my point of view.\n\nOn the one hand, funding the arts could benefit economically to the country because it is one of the main aspects of international tourism. One of the primary reasons for travelling overseas is the fact that tourists are always interested in foreign museums, theatres and other artistic facilities. Therefore, if the government spends more wages to develop and maintain its art fields, for instance, the country will make more profit, leading to an improved economic condition. The more money will spend on the arts, the more economic growth will occur.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other areas that need more funding, including health and education. The prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, is increasing these days, causing financial problems for the citizens. For example, the number of people who suffer from these health issues can be reduced if the authorities focus on public health and spend more money to prevent public from the diseases. In addition, improving the education system may be crucial for the younger, who is the key to developing the country. Thus, I strongly believe that spending a sufficient amount of money on health and education will be more advantageous for the country in a long run. \n\nTo conclude, although spending money on the arts will benefit in terms of economy, it will lead to  more positive consequences if the government spends more money on health and education.

While a number of people believe that the most effective approach is raising the fare of fast meal. I, however, would argue that is is not a definite answer to this issue.\n\nOn the one hand, there are compelling reasons for those who bear a thought that raising  ready-made food fee can mitigate the weight-related problem. This is because the processed food fare has an inversely proportion to the load of consumption of such meal. For instance, many reports indicated that when the fare of fattening meal increases, the load of high-calories meal consumption would alleviate. Therefore, the number of population who contract obesity could be reduced now that It is the fat and cholesterol content in the fast meal which are the root cause of overweight.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that exercising regularly to burn the fat is also the viable measure to cope with this problem. Due to the fact that the lack of physical activities which is a part of sedentary lifestyle, is considered as a culprit of overweight. Not to mention that following healthy and balance diet with more the volume of fresh plant-based ingredients which lower the great load of fat and cholesterol in daily meal, can mitigate the number of obese people.

In this essay, I will be discussing both views and giving my opinion.\n\nNowadays, a standard to be employed in a good company in order to earn a high salary is to have a university education. In other words, most organizations require their employees to have at least a bachelor's degree. For instance, in Thailand, a degree from a particular university can determine what company each person can join, which is the more reputable university, the better job position. In contrast, if a person has lower education levels, one can only become a labour force or worker.\n\nOn the other hand, some people can become successful without university degrees. For example, the most popular social media platform, Facebook, was established by a university student that later decided to drop out of school to pursue his career. That is to say, without university degrees, one can achieve success in their career. However, the chances are slim for ordinary people, in which the possibility can be only one in a million.

Some people assert, that the prominent aim of them should be an entertaining character, while others consider, that historical instituitions should teach people to immerse deeply in past. From my personal standpoint, I maintain the first viewpoint on this concept, perceiving that they are essential for increasing the number of visitors and for encouraging the young generation in past time events.\n\n\u2028\n\nTo begin with, the redevelopment of historical sites for entertainment may interest more people in local tradition and culture. Und\n\neniably, learning past chronology can be challenging for those who are not professionally involved in it. For example, if the government engages in  plenty of innovative approaches to museum pieces of art or stories, it will foster a better understanding of the main ideas and values for all age groups. Therefore, museums will be a versatile place where families have the opportunity to spend leisure time with children as well as researchers to learn new about past.\n\n\u2028\n\nHowever, it can be considered into account that such places have been established for dedicating the escalation of the previous generations' mistakes. Thus, the development of a modern recreational approach to historical buildings leads to the devaluation of the principles of museums. To explain, scientific researchers or junior historians will not be more able to rely on museums as the source of truthful information, if the content of such places is aimed to make history clear and comprehensible for the large target audience. That is why museums should be taken seriously and adhere to the traditional purpose of education.\n\n\u2028\n\nIn conclusion, there exist several strong rationales that underscore the significance of redevelopment  of the museum's concepts for addressing the better understanding of visitors.

Furthermore, through their favourite tv shows kids will find that process of learning more enjoyable and fun. Nowadays, the word has become borderless. It is mean that various information from all over the world is accessible for everyone. Netflix,for example, gives particular tv shows in differents languages for kids in the other countries.

In this essay, I will examine some facts that convince me of why this is not the major solution and then some examples will be exposed.\n\nFirstly, to raise fuel's price affects the economy of a country. As a great number of goods depends on local transports such as trucks, vans, car and suchlike. Therefore, this action would be reflected in the final price of these goods which would lead the final consumer to pay the bill. For example, if a supermarket depends on trucks to receive their manufactured goods they would have to increase their prices due to the fact that trucks mostly rely on costly combustible to arrive in the supermarket.\n\nAnother reason why I support this notion is that recycling can bring about more benefits than by increasing fuel's prices. It is known that less than 25% of the countries in the world have been enticing people to recycle in the last decades. As a consequence, all the garbage produced by all other 75% of the countries is not controlling garbage treatment which is triggering a high impact in the environment in an unprecedented way. For instance, in emergent countries, people tend to throw litter in rivers, lakes and so on, thus, they are prone to have issues with water in a near future.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are better paths follow instead of increasing the price of fuels which means that this action would actually harm the economy of a country.

First of all, taking part in community works is able to strengthen essential skills; for instance, when students work in the hospital to take care of elderly people, they can develop communication skill and responsibility.

Some people recommand that the price of junk food should be raised to tackle this problem, while in my opinion, it might be helpful to some extant, but there are other measures that are more effective to address this issue better.\n\nOn the one hand, admittedly, rising the price of junk food can help to shape the consumers' eating habits. Firstly, consumers would seek alternative options over sugary and fast foods due to limited budget. If the unhealth foods, such as cheese burgars, pizzas and sodas cost too much, people would rather choose some cost-effective and low-calorie products to minimize the food expense.\n\nIn addition, increasing the price of fat food is actually make the food producer losing some of the markets and reducing sales profits.

Therefore, more methods are required to mitigate public overweight issue.

What are the problems for young people who are living in the cities as the result of continued growth? What are the solutions for these problems?\nEssay: It is true that the nations have increasingly developed, which means that current generations of these countries face a significant number of pressures when residing in the metropolises. In this essay, I will point out the origins of this phenomenon, and suggest several methods to mitigate it. \n\nTo begin with, several factors act as a catalyst for such a phenomenon. First, the competition in vocations is increasingly serious. To be specific, the proportion of newly-graduated students is extremely high, but available occupations are unable to meet their needs. In fact, in Vietnam, almost all businesses only employ staff who have over one year of experience, which results in a significant number of unemployed individuals. Second, adults who migrate to metropolises always have the pressures of success. To elaborate, said citizens always want to have a new life with a stable income to take care of their family and themselves. In the long run, this destructively impacts their psychology such as depression. \n\nFortunately, this phenomenon can be tackled when various measures are taken. The most pertinent point is that The coalition between universities and firms would create career opportunities for undergraduates. Specifically, these days, universities would arrange for  final-year students to intern at numerous firms to have practical knowledge. In reality, at  Foreign Trade University in VietNam, teachers frequently organize professional events to help undergraduates orientate their lines of work in the future. Another justification is that households and communities play an important role in the developing career of adults. In particular, families and society should communicate and accompany them in the built-processing careers of the young in urban centres. In addition,current generations are encouraged to engage in clubs to decrease stress. \n\nIn conclusion, it is disputable that the rate of unemployment and the pressure of life are menaces for minors in cities.

In such cases, the administration has done their duty so we can't blame them and it is our fault that we have not accepted it broadly. Is blaming anyone solving the issue? The answer is wrong.

In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea and will outline several reasons following in this essay.\n\nFirstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which is essential for effective cooperation. When children attend team sports, whether it be basketball, football, or volleyball require communication with each other players, that occasion let them aware of how communication skills important because it is the only way to success in the match, they will learn more and more different features that can be used in their conversation through verbal communication, hand signals, body language, or other forms of communication, and by regularly practicing the many forms of communication involved in playing team sports, children are improving their communication skills steadily and they will feel more confident and simply when they need to cooperate with another one in class.\n\nSecondly, when children take part in team sports at school, they will have more opportunities to exactly know what cooperation means, to learn and explore more effective methods to reach the common goal, which is basic and defined as cooperation. Playing team sports, children are forced to learn how to work together politically and kindly, take me as an example, I am in my school's basketball team, and our coach is extremely focused on drills that train us how to execute certain strategies that require us to cooperate with another member, and by doing so, that let me have recognition and experience the benefits of working together firsthand, which make me a desire and enthusiasm to cooperate with others because by doing so, we will be better and have a sense of belonging.\n\nIn conclusion, team sports help students improve their ability to communicate skills and allow them to experience the benefits of cooperating for the first time, which will inspire them and motivate them to cooperate better with others in the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Clearly, it is significant for humans to utilize such convenient vehicles to arrive at other places though the drawback is they may affect traffic and environmental problems.\n\nIt is useful to take vehicles to reach everywhere although it will cause traffic jams and gas exhaust. That is, the more frequently people use vehicles, the more traffic and environmental issues will arise. These vehicles will produce a great deal of detrimental exhaust to the environment because there are plenty of people in urban cities who drive their cars and motorcycles to commute. Additionally, there will usually be traffic jams after work and school so that many cars and motorcycles are pretty crowded and pedestrians have trouble walking.\n\nIn order to solve traffic jams and harmful exhaust, governments should establish legislation to regulate the proper amount of exhaust emission.

For example, when COVID-19 was happening, many students could study from their homes. In addition, many academic tutors have  used online programs to teach their lessons.

However,\n educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and\n governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or\n disagree?\nEssay: A discussion on educational parameters has always been permeative and immanent among intellectuals. When it comes to literacy and edification, a certain school of thought peddles the need to educate the children and younger generation. Contrastingly, significant others say that a major focus and the principal budget should be invested in the education of adults. However, I find myself standing tall with the former viewpoint and consider investing and accentuating both the focus and the capital in the fortification of the younger cohort. In subsequent paragraphs, this essay shall see my thoughts on the topic.\n\nTo begin with, the eminent adage - \u201cThe childhood shows the man, as the morning shows the day,\u201d - perspicuously endows the essence of educating children as they are the building blocks of the imminent scenario that shall prevail in the times to come. In that case, diverting the focus or the economic budget that is planned to be bequeathed to the nurturing of the younger minds shall impede the entire agenda and the propitious growth of substantial human resources at the same time. Education is inexorably mandatory. However, when it comes to the educational refinement of the adults, not only do the procedural alignments become pretty arduous, but also time consuming. Therefore, the point of allocating the major budget to adult education, in accordance with my prudence, is a bit faltering.\n\nMoreover, as is researched, when we compare the learning ambit of children and adults, it has  always been found, as per various reconnoiters, that children outsmart adults when it comes to\n\n grasping and retaining countenance. In such a scenario, where the potential scope of laying the herculean foundation for the future can be well established with considerable economic assets,\n\n gnawing it off would not contribute to the significance of the development. Therefore, from the tangential tinge of substantial growth, too, it is both providential and prudential to foster the\n\n virtues of the buds that would culminate in the inflorescence of the prosperity of a nation.\n\n Although I don\u2019t deny the essence of soft training and coaching of adults, and that the andragogy should as well be seen with punctilio as far as the present developmental strides are concerned, the very thought process to dedicate the lion\u2019s share in favour of adult education, thereby, rendering the pedagogy of children undervalued, doesn\u2019t go well.\n\nHence, conclusively we may say that education is ineluctably a necessity and edifying and capitalizing on the young budding talents is mandatory. Naturally, therefore, it should be more attentively dealt with without having them in a comparative equation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

I partially agree with the statement because there are many negatives that can not be ignored however, there are a few positives as well.\n\nTo begin with, excessive advertising is responsible for diverting minds and generating unnecessary needs among the people. For example, Coca-Cola or Pepsi flooded the television and radio with their advertisements, and people are buying them like crazy, even knowing the disadvantages. Additionally, people are influenced by the use of their role models; sadly, they pretend to use these products, whereas the truth is nowhere near.\n\nHowever, the advertisement also has the positive side where people get to know about many important products and services. The companies spend huge to spread these information of products, services, events etc for the additional reach, and it depends on an individual to act or just ignore them.

Moreover, governments are earning huge income from this industry and using it for the further development of the country.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to assert that although people are directed towards man-made trends and influenced as per their own wishes, advertisement still provides many important benefits, like helping the country's GDP and promoting their own goods and services, which people can use for their benefits"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.0"}]}

As a result, people migrate to foreign lands because they can provide better education and life to their children. It has been noticed that most of the people are migrating from underdeveloped countries to developed countries.

Firstly, There is no doubt that  Living different country comes with challenges, especially for children. They may find it onerous to adjust to a new environment and culture. Besides, Foreign language is another hurdle that has been faced by them. Children find it harder to make new friends due to cultural and language diversity. They feel isolated which may lead to depression.

I completely disagree with this opinion as we still have time to tackle this matter so that we could reduce the impact on human beings.\n\u00a0\nThe Government and individuals have responsibilities to combat climate change, and they can use several measures to protect or at least mitigate the earth\u2019s climate.

Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\nEssay: Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today\u2019s schools."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

However, others believe that the parents of these children should be punished. I tend to be in favour of the latter opinion and in this essay I will explore both views and explain my point of view.\n\nIt is obvious that everybody should be accountable for their own behaviour and should be penalized in case of their wrongdoing. However, we could be in a dilemma when crimes are made by children. On the one hand, if children commit crimes they should be punished because it is likely to prevent them from the next offences. On the contrary, if children avoid penalties, they would not be able to realize the full severeness of this issue and its consequences. Undoubtedly, the main purpose of punishment is to demonstrate that you will be punished in case of your perpetration.  While exemption from punishment would lead to children repeating crimes.\n\nOn the other hand, children are not adults, and perhaps they do not understand the full seriousness of wrong behaviour. I'm sure that parents are completely responsible for their children in terms of their upbringing as well as their behaviour. For example, when a child steals a cellphone from his classmate, it is likely the parents of this child failed to explain to them that theft is extremelly wrong behaviour and this would lead them to prison. Moreover, when parents get out of touch with their children, or even worse, set an example of wrong behaviour, it is clear that they should have carry full responsibility for themselves and for their children.\n\nIn conclusion, while children should realize all repercussions of their offences, nonetheless, the ultimate responsibility for kids' wrongdoing lies with their parents, which were not able to teach their children the right behaviour and to prevent crimes committed by them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Many people stated that what truly matters is the productivity of their work and organizations shouldn't concentrate on the workers' dress code. However, I completely disagree with such an idea due to two main reasons.\n\nOne reason supporting my disagreement with the aforementioned statement is its counterproductive nature, There exist many arguments that at the end of the day, the staff's specialization and knowledge are key factors that lead to an increase in their career ladder. Nonetheless, this statement is flawed to me because how an individual dress reflects their professionalism in a workplace, which directly affects their personality and quality of work. In detail, even with ingenious innovations and profound knowledge in their fields, it only can be seen that a person does not show respect towards the company's policy and has no concept of working and living in a strictly regulated community if they put on informal or inappropriate items to work. As an illustration, those who are employed in the service industry are obligated to wear proper office attire as a way to present courtesy and appreciation to their clients. \n\nAnother reason is having uniforms or specific dress codes are associated with the reputation of the firms.  In other words, the same attire supports potential customers to identify the business more effortlessly, therefore raising brand awareness and bringing back an incline in sales for the companies. Furthermore, uniforms help people in one's organization feel they are a part of a team, thereby fostering a sense of pride and increasing their productivity. \n\nIn conclusion, I have strong opposition to the statement that  employers should ignore what their employees clothe themselves in due to the reasons namely costumes reflect an individual's mindset in a professional environment, and  putting regulations on how all staff in a company should dress in a particular way will determine a brand's reputation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

So, several people argued that this problem should be solved by attending governments with raising the price of fattening foods. I strongly disagree with this idea for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it is not justly to increase the price of food products in order to encounter obesity. People from all walks of life purchase fast food like hamburgers, pizza, and French fries.

Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\nEssay: There is a controversial argument heating a debate over whether carrying a research on our origin or investing in our present and future generations should be taken into great consideration. While I am in the middle of these schools of thought, this essay is devoted to analyzing both views followed by parallel justifications.\n\nIt is indisputable that having more insights about our relations and ancestors stands us in good stead in preserving family culture and avoiding genetic disease. Digging deeper in the compilation of family hierarchy and conventional background helps descendants to see a more detailed picture of the invaluable cultural inheritances of their family, which helps them avoid the neglect of spiritual legacy. Consequently, future generations will aware of the very essentials of preserving family traditions and customs, especially in families that origins from the old aristocracy or have a rich history. In terms of biology, the compilation of family trees in the family books acts as vital indicators of latent diseases. There is a myriad of hereditary diseases that may run on families for generations such as heart stroke, cardiovascular system-related health problems, and lung cancers. By having a firm grasp on family health history, patients can be equipped with better preparation from the early stages. Therefore, studying the family history is of importance to carry on the traditional values as well as benefit medically.\n\nWhile the redeeming merits of researching family history are widely acknowledged, it is not fair if that of paying attention to current generations is not mentioned. Instead of totally concentrating on relations with whom we may have lost track for decades, quality relationships around us like neighbours, co-workers, which have an immense impact on our lives should be cultivated. It is those people who will lend us a prompt hand in dire need that distant cousins can not do. Besides, carrying out research on family trees requires a great amount of money and human resources, which can be better utilized if they are allocated to children's education. Our next generations armed with knowledge and novel sets of skills learned at top-notch schools will undoubtedly land brighter job opportunities. Without a shadow of a doubt, putting strain on present relationships and future generations education has favourable benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst learning about family background do good for family traditional preservations and medical research, current relationships and future educations also need a great concentration. It is vital to allocate resources in the right aspects according to each family\u2019s financial background and circumstances."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

It is my firm belief should not do unpaid job due to some reasons. \n\nSome people point out that doing unpaid jobs bring specific privileges for teenagers. The most powerful argument in favour of this idea is that this kind of job broadens teenagers\u2019 horizons in some way and they learn to be more altruistic. The ability to be helpful without any expectation cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, youngsters\u2019 time is extremely precious; therefore, they need to make the best use of it.

Personally, I completely agree with this idea and will outline several reasons why in the following essay.\n\nFirstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which are essential for effective cooperation. When children are engaged in team sports, whether it be basketball, football, or any other team sport that requires communication between the players, it is essential that they learn how to communicate with one another effectively in order to win the match. This can be achieved through verbal communication, body language, hand signals, or other forms of communication, and by regularly practising the many forms of communication involved in playing team sports, children are improving their ability to cooperate with one another simply through an improved ability to communicate.\n\nSecondly, by taking part in team sports at school, children learn the effectiveness of working together in order to reach a common goal, which is the basis of cooperation. By playing team sports, children are forced to learn how to work together in order to win a match. In many team sports, training sessions focus on drills that train students how to execute certain strategies that require them to cooperate with one another, and by doing so, they get to experience the benefits of working together firsthand. If children do not have a good understanding of exactly how working together to reach a common goal is far more effective than working independently, then they will not have the desire or enthusiasm to cooperate with others. \n\nIn conclusion, team sports help students improve their communication skills and allow them to experience first-hand the results of working together, which will then inspire and motivate them to cooperate better with others in the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. \n\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons to explain why government funding is necessary.First of all, it will help children have equal education opportunities, especially in mountainous areas. Many parents do not have enough conditions to pay for the school fees of their children as a lot of children do not know how to write and read. In addition, investing in education means investing in the future because it helps young people have more and more opportunities to improve their knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand, funding leisure activities will help citizens release from overstress or depression. In modern society, young people are stressed by many factors such as relationships and peerpressure, especially when they struggle with many exams and hard homework. The government needs to provide some entertainment channels and other facilities. school can build a place thathas a cafe for students during break time. They can relax and spend time with their peers due to having more energy for study.

While some argue its educational value, I firmly believe that excessive TV viewing can be detrimental to a child's well-being, and I'll elucidate my stance with rationale and examples.\n\nFirstly, the pervasive use of television and technology exposes children to potential health issues. Extended screen time strains young eyes, potentially leading to vision problems and various health ailments. Moreover, excessive TV consumption can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and related health concerns.\n\nAdditionally, studies highlight the addictive nature of television, potentially impacting children's self-regulation and academic performance. Excessive viewing habits can lead to addiction, disrupting their focus on studies and negatively impacting their educational outcomes.\n\nWhile television might offer some educational content, the adverse effects on health and academic performance outweigh these benefits.

After the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, many individuals pay more attention to their health.

Some may argue this offers many advantages just to clerks rather than employers. In my opinion, this method is beneficial for both sides, and I strongly disagree with the statement.\n\nThere are several reasons why some may consider the positive aspects of working at home only for workers. To begin with, they do not need to pay for commuting to job location as well as no waste of time for any public transportation or traffic jam; thus they tend to earn more than before, in other words, making more money and comforting them. In addition, remote workers will have a healthier lifestyle. Thanks to the extra time that such job conditions provide, they have enough time for exercise and most likely eat more homemade rather than convenience foods. Finally, employees at home will not be monitored as much as they used to when their job was in-person since there is no manager or supervisor. Therefore, there are many advantages for home workers.\n\nHowever, these online works are beneficial for job owners as well. In this way, employers do not need to pay for resources such as equipment and a huge office building while they are inevitable for in-person jobs. As a result, skipping these costly steps would increase the income. For example, there is no spending on furniture or electricity. Moreover, as employees have better communication with their co-workers due to using computers, they perform more efficiently. This increases the performance, resulting in more satisfaction for customers and consequently, higher revenue and reputation for companies. A real-life example is a company where I work, which since the sales representatives started working online the company\u2019s sales have risen significantly.\n\nIn my view, as the reasons mentioned, working at home offers vast benefits not only to staff but also to companies and I disagree that only employees take advantage of this style of working.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that many argue that remote jobs do not have positive income for employers and only benefits the staff, as far as I am concerned this is not true.

Although a school of thought to think that increasing fuel prices for automobiles would solve these problems, I strongly disagree with this view. This essay will argue that this option will not only negatively affect the cost of living of low-income earners, but also, it will be a wrong approach to solving climate change issues.\n\nFirstly, An increase in the pump price of fuels will result in an increase in transportation cost and in general, the cost of living in the society. Consequently, the average standard of living will drop. The rate of poverty is on the increase and many families struggle to put food on their tables. For instance, a man who currently earns less than required to sustain his family and is just getting by, will be pushed into depression and possibly suicide when he realizes his salary can no longer meet his family's needs. In addition, many companies will lose workers as their wages may not cover the cost of transportation to work.\n\nSecondly, there are other sources of energy that could be researched into for possibilities of replacing the use of fuels that affect our environment.  These could be renewable sources like water and wind. Authorities should disburse funds to research centres and institutes  enough to enable the scientists to work more to discover how hydro-power can be used in vehicles and other engines instead of atmosphere damaging fuels. For example, a climate change activist travelled from China to Geneva to attend the last climate change summit in Geneva using an emission-free boat. She did not need to join world leaders who came in private jets that further added to the problem they were supposedly going to discuss.\n\nIn conclusion, all of humankind must take responsibility for the environment but definitely not at the expense of the people who barely make enough money to get by.

For example, someone who want to move in his/her new house, will ask the previous occupant are there any parts of the house that need to be maintained such as the toilet or the roof. So, they can repair it as soon as possible to prevent unwanted accident. Another example, they need to know about other amenities such as sport center or security equipment like CCTV.\n\nFurthermore, when they want to move to another town, they will consider about the situation of their neighborhood such as the criminal levels. It is a crucial issues especially if we want to move with the family. There are some ways to know the story behind their building such as from the landlord, the internet, or their neighbor. Most of usually know from their neighbor while they go shopping or do some activities in public area. \n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to know about the history of our house to make prevent any unwanted accident and also as consideration to move to another place."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: It is a popular trend that with the fast progress of the society, some violence plots are added into films and computer games. This situation heated a discussion, some people held conventional opinions that it has many bad influences, but an escalating category of people prefer to think it is harmless which I totally agree with. In the following essay, my contention will be further scrutinized.\n\nTo begin with, it is widely known that the forms of art change constantly in order to adapt the development of the era. This is because in the different specific time, the theme of the society is different which lead to different demands of people. Besides, art is the reflection of the characteristics of The Times. An eminent example of this is in the Renaissance era, many masters changed their painting or writing styles from praising the god and the church into celebrating the greatness of people such as Raphael and Michelangelo. Therefore, in the modern society, more and more informative technologies are invented and the fast pace of the life give people much more pressure than before. So watching some violence pictures can release stress and help people adapt to this fast-changing society.\n\nHowever, as some conventional opinion say that too much violence is not good for people\u2019s mental health. To illustrate this, in some occasions, if individuals who are obsessed with the those kinds of film or computer games are tend to have propensity for violence. This will contribute to more crimes and cause social instability. Moreover, without too much restrictions, teenagers can easily find the resources of the violent films and computer games. This will definitely influence their mental health due to the immature mind. Thus, it is important for managers to implement some measures and policies to partly limit people\u2019s behavior especially set some limitations for the youth.\n\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, I can reiterate that I believe that watching films and playing computer games which contain violence are trend of this society and can help people relax. But these behaviors must be under control, otherwise, there will be more crimes and bad influences on people\u2019s mental health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

Other people believe that children should be taught this at home.\n Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion\nEssay: Nowadays, there are a lot of environmental problems. Some people believe that children should be educated at the academy rather than at home. This essay will discuss both aspects in detail and will finally conclude why it is better if an individual is trained at home.\n\nPeople believe that it is necessary for children to be taught at school for multiple reasons. Firstly, children are more serious when they are at th the academy. Since their focus levels are higher they will pay more attention to subtle issues pertaining to the environment. According to a survey conducted in America, seventy-two per cent of the children who claimed that recycling is the most important factor to protect the globe were from non-private schools. It was not until a few months later that the researchers realised that the government had conducted a workshop where novices learnt the significance of recycling. Secondly, there are an uncountable number of activities conducted by schools. The children, consequently, learnt through practical methods.\n\nIn contrast, many citizens believe that it is better if candidates are taught at home. Therefore, this should not be the responsibility of education boards. Moreover, parents are supposed to be held responsible for inculcating nature-friendly practices such as recycling. To illustrate, if a child sees their parents taking an effort to recycle non-organic compounds, they will automatically pick up similar habits. In addition, a child spends more time at home than at school. As a result, there are more opportunities to implement recycling techniques.\n\nTo sum up, although it is vital for schools to convey the value of recycling to their students, I strongly believe that learning at home has more advantages. Unfortunately, many children do not take their lessons seriously but if guardians struggle to explain them to their young ones, the idea of recycling will eventually become intuitive."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

However, some people say that it is impossible to be a \u201cresponsible tourist\" To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: With the increase in the number of visitors to tourist sites, nowadays, It has become a common thing to see used objects and containers thrown around tourist sites. Even worse, some foreigners who come to visit try to brainwash the local people and debunk their culture. Recently, People who have observed this has tried to organize a movement to try to avoid these and be responsible tourist. However, despite  their claim, they are yet to get the trust of the public as many people believe it is impossible for every tourist to be responsible. In this essay, I will give my opinion on how hard it is to generalise for large groups of visitors and how it should be claimed and understood instead. \n\nThere are many visitors who really care and worry about the places they usually go to visit. And they usually come up with innovative ideas on how to improve the system in handling the preservation of culture and environment. For instance, last year 8 Australian tourists who went to visit a historical place in Sudan  found the environment around to be in an alarming state. and Immediately after they went back home they were able to raise funds that will be used to clean the surroundings and renovate the historical area. So, although not every tourist is responsible, there are genuine tourists who want to protect the environment they go to visit.\n\nNeedless to say, however, there is a large swath of people who does things that harm the tourist sites. Some don't care about the objects they use and where they throw them. And others are busy trashing the local culture just because it doesn't align with their way of living or the culture they came from. For instance, during the last world cup people were criticizing Qatar for not allowing similar-gender marriage and trying to impose their own culture.\n\nTherefore, saying every tourist will be responsible is impractical. But at the same time, we can not generalize the acts of some bad people to every tourist as there are  many good tourists who genuinely want to protect the culture and environment. So, the narrative that responsible tourists have started to pay attention to protecting the environment should not be taken literally and it should not be understood negatively. It instead should be encouraged and the people who took the initiative to start the movement should be appreciated as this is how things improve and eventually it might become a norm for every tourist."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

Nonetheless, it is believed that these celebrities should not become role models for current generations because property and glamour are the foundations for their popularity. From my perspective, this opinion is completely unreasonable. I will explain my viewpoint in the following paragraphs. \n\nPerhaps for many, this opinion is quite convincing because of several seasons. First, property and fame will be sustainable motivations for off-spring to learn and practice more. To be specific, famous singers or actresses occasionally use social media to update their life which is said to be lavish with overpriced clothes or watches. When teenagers who are main users of the internet community see these KOL\u2019s posts, they will be stimulated to find ways such as learning acting or singing to enjoy a glamorous lifestyle. Second, it does not matter how much money celebrities have, it is the purpose of their money that matters. In fact, there are an ample number of inspirers who possess a great fortune but they utilize this property to help poor people instead of a spending spree. For instance, Ha Anh Tuan, who earned lots of capital through his singing talent, donated most of his finances to help people affected by the calamity.      \n\nHowever, the above arguments are insufficient to overshadow the pitfalls of said matter.  In its simplest, society will lack talents for research and origination which are the basis for development. From past to present, valuable inventions such as the Internet are important underpins to help humans have a more convenient life while songs or films are only for entertainment. Sadly, Vietnamese singers and models receive more money than most researchers,  discouraging young individuals from doing scientific research. Additionally, possessions and popularity are only provisional while knowledge and skills will help humans forever. In reality, Edison, who invented electric light in the 19th century, is still well-known today but most people are unable to name a famous singer of that century. \n\n In conclusion, this issue would promote young people to try hard every day and the abundance of money of these celebrities will help those in need. However, I still protest this opinion because it prevents the evolution of society and these assets or reputation are unstable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

While it is claimed by some people that these game bring children with certain benefits, others believe that gaming may be detrimental to them. The following essay analyzes both views and I firmly support for the idea that electronic games influence negatively on young generation.\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why it might be argued that electronic games have specific merits. The most widely acknowledged positive impact is that playing games promotes children\u2019s cognitive skills regarding concentration, imagination and sympathy. A case in point is that when the young approach to such a game that is kind of helping others, they tend to show more empathy in their daily lives. In addition to that, electronic games are significantly beneficial for players\u2019 mental health. To illustrate, games can entertain players and help them recharge their battery after school. Therefore, to some extent, it is worth for children spending time on electronic games.\nDespite the above arguments, I contend that electronic games have a detrimental impact on young generation. Firstly, the most concerning problem that these ones may adversely affect children\u2019s physical health. That children glue their eyes in front of the screen playing game can pose the risk of obesity, heart attack and a certain form of cancers. Moreover, exposure to high video game violence is likely to have effect on behavior in children. As a result, they have a tendency to get aggressive manner whenever facing with a problem in real life. For instance, when they get into trouble with friends, they resort to violence to deal with their problem easily. \nIn conclusion, while it is argued that electronic games bring their own merits, I still concur that they do harm the young and suppose that time spent on games should be controlled strictly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Therefore, some historic buildings had to be torn down. It is a pity that our next generation may not have the opportunity to visit some of the places of interest.\n\nIn order to learn more about the history, many people would like to get to know the history of the house or building that they live in. There are many reasons for this. First of all, many people are interested in the history. They are eager to figure out what had happened in the past, so that they could benefit form it.

However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.\nDue to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.\nOn the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.\nIn my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses.

However, some people propound that sending their children to co-educational is more beneficial when they grow up. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. \n\nOn the one hand, co-educational schools has many benefits to children. To put it simply, most parents believe that co-educational environment is more pleasant as there is no separation between boys and girls, which is important because kids will be able to have better understandings of other genders. Also, such environment promotes life-long friendship. The earlier students know each other, the longer relationship lasts. Take an example of Thai students, almost all schools encourage children to have friends from other schools by local community activities. \n\nOn the other hand, it is considered by many that single-sex schools are outdated, which many countries have already abolished this practice for many decades. To put it further, it seem to me that this method have many drawbacks. Firstly, it encourages children to become highly competitive and isolates children from other genders. That is to say, children might never have an opportunity to get to know friends who have a different gender, therefore, they will have a much smaller circle of friends, compared to the co-educational schools.

Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.\nIn my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals.

Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.\nI believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned.

I firmly believe that co-educational institutions are a boon, not only for the healthy future of children, but also for the nation as well.\nFirstly, pupils who studied in single sex schools, take huge time to get involved in conversation with the opposite gender, the reason behind is, they never experienced public conversation earlier, therefore, pupils do not feel comfortable to speak publicly and get nervous when they have to ask any question or any favor. Moreover, children who get more comfortable in their own group, sometimes behave in improper way with others as few conversations should remain with close people. Most importantly the context of delivery of words should be accurate and proper; otherwise it could hurt the emotions of others or could leave the person embarrassed. The way of using proper words and gesture could develop by studding together.\nFurthermore, students can learn and observe various things from their peer which are having opposite gender by doing healthy competition. This would lead to developing many traits which will enhance their knowledge and experience in a positive way.

Furthermore, people are able to have a consultation with people around the world about their conserns of their lifestyle and mental issues that used to be confidential to their family, or friends face-to-face. These advantages let people expand their insights. Moreover, in business scenes, people frequently tap into some other communication tools, like Skype, Microsoft teams, and Zoom meetings. This social media is much helpful to work regardless of time, and place so that people can work with other country's colleagues. This is more profitable to make a sales figure smoothly because they can make more strategies because of these tools.\nOn the other hand, there might be some disadvantages.

This essay will discuss further two perspectives regarding the one-year gap scheme and illustrate each case.\n\nOn one hand, gap year regulation gives both parents and students time in preparing the application requirements thoroughly. In fact, kids are enforced to meet the qualification where they have to be  straight-A students in class as well as involved actively in the community. Apparently, being a part of  society consumes  extra time and some children are prioritised to have an extra lesson instead. For instance, some children who are not prepared for an exam tend to take the private lessons outside school time which obviously affects their availability in taking volunteering in their neighbourhood. As a result, their submission process might be affected due to this situation. Therefore, the gap year system will suit high schoolers who want to continue their study.\n\nOn the other hand, some might think this system is reckless where children might be affected and loosen their strategy through university. It is understandable that youngsters are unstable especially if they are not encouraged. Giving them a space of time is a bit risky from some perspectives. To illustrate, after graduation, there will be no formal supervision for the kids which means some can lose their motivation and spirit during the period of preparation. Although they are grownups, their instability dominates in decision-making. Instead of being well-prepared, a gap year might impact their enthusiasm to learn.\n\nTo conclude, gap year regulation impact differently amongst children. It might be a positive decision where students focus on one activity at a time resulting high acceptance rate in university. Nevertheless, it might affect negatively youngsters which impacts their learning processes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

I personally would have a say for both views, respectively. This essay will discuss both the arguments in detail and provide evidence as to why, people debate over the needs of art.\nFirstly, a factor that makes an individual assume that the topic is not necessary, is because of the future careers of the children. For instance, if I were to be a future pilot, my parents definitely would not think of the course as a requirement. There is a plethora of people who opine this way. Therefore, it is completely understandable for the area of people that think it is unnecessary.\nOn the other hand, there are folks who think that art should be a large part of everyone's life.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is undeniable that low-quality house construction in big cities can lead to negative outcomes related to people\u2019s lives. I personally believe that authorities are the only organizations that can address this issue.\n\nOn the one hand,  high-quality accommodation requires a huge investment which most people can not afford, causing the lack of houses with good conditions resulting in a need for government support. In other words, besides housing, people have to spend their money on other essential services and food, contributing to a consideration for balance expenses. Consequently, individuals with limited budgets take a small amount of money to pay for low-quality housing regardless of risks related to safety. As a result, it is necessary for administrations to be in charge of raising house funds to lend to residents with low interest if they use the loans for good housing. Furthermore, governments can diversify levels of taxes, applying lower taxes for communities with low incomes, helping them to decrease tax burdens, contributing to consideration for better accommodations.\n\nOn the other hand, authorities need to enact stricter regulations for house construction processes. The lack of integrity in housing establishments from some organizations is observing an upward trend. It means that they decrease housing investment budgets for personal purposes causing lower amounts of money that can merely afford low-quality building materials, consequently attributed as a main reason for the shortage of housing. Hence, in order to address the aforementioned issue, authorities are the sole institutions which have sufficient power to control this bad situation by banning heavy fines for individuals who are working illegally.\n\nIn conclusion, the housing crisis caused by the deficiency of quality can be solved by no one except authorities as they can apply supporting methods and regulations to improve the occurrence"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

I would argue that both things are of paramount importance for the development of a nation. This essay will explore both sides of an issue in detail.\n\nArt is of paramount importance in building great nations because of several reasons. To begin with, it depicts the culture and traditions of a particular region or country. It means that any country which remembers its origin remains important in the eyes of its residents. To add to it, art enhances creativity in individuals. If a person is more creative, he will also perform better in other fields of life as well. Thus, governing bodies should allocate more budget for the activities which are related to arts such as cultural shows and exhibitions.\n\nResearch in scientific fields is also associated with several benefits. Firstly, we are living in the age of technology, therefore, progression in developing new technology is really necessary to reap more benefits from it. Another main reason is that with the development of technology, our survival has become more difficult over time. For instance, the world has faced the issue of the covid pandemic in recent years which shows that we are also suffering from various new diseases, so new vaccines or medicines are also required to limit them. This can only be achieved if the government gives more financial resources in the form of research allowances for scientists or building new research laboratories.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that policymakers must provide resources for arts and scientific achievements so that society can flourish.

Why is this case happening? How should children or teenagers be punished?\nEssay: More violence content in the media and the lack of correct guidance from parents are to blame for an endemic of juvenile delinquency all around the world. There are a number of punishments which should be meted out to deter youth crime.\n\nTeenagers are particularly susceptible to violence in media content and might imitate media violence if their emotional well-being is neglected by parents. For instance, television sometimes encourages aggressive or even violent behaviour among young people, and children who are exposed to those programs would tend to resort to violence when they face problems. In addition, parents pay more attention on physical condition instead of psychological situation of their children. This is particularly the case for single parents, who have to resume childcare responsibility while being occupied with a full-time job. When parents fail to meet their children\u2019s emotional needs, it is possible for children to feel unloved and rejected and therefore take revenge on society.\n\nThe authorities should take the severity of an offence when it comes to giving punishments to young offenders into account. To be specific, teenagers who commit minor crimes such as pick-pocketing should serve a relative short sentence and have a chance to retrain for new skills in rehabilitation facilities. By doing this, it will ensure them a job when they are back to society. By the contrast, for those who have carried out severe crimes ought to receive harsh punishment such as a long prison sentence regardless their ages. This is because the punishment is a comfort to victims and would have a deterrent effect on society as a whole.  Besides, young offenders who commit felony should be given a chance to retrain useful skills and develop better understanding of correct moral behaviour in case of being a repeat offender. \n\nIn conclusion, a frequent exposure to violence in the media and parental neglect are two contributors to a rising trend of youth crime.

However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.\nAn increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.\nIndeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.\nMy take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Discuss both views.\nEssay: Recently there has been a lot of debate about the necessity of higher education. One side is of the opinion that youngsters should attend university, while the other supports the idea of finding employment immediately after high school. Both pathways have their advantages and disadvantages when a successful career is concerned: a college degree ensures more excellent expertise but is inappropriate for those not into intense studying; and while getting a job straight after school helps adolescents to quickly gain experience, they are likely to miss out on important technical knowledge.\n\nThe most prominent benefit of tertiary school is adequate training to work in a specific field. At college, students are taught available theories related to their majors as well as provided hands-on practice via laboratory activities, internships, and other forms of job simulation. Accordingly, they will be skilled enough to pursue ambitious goals after graduation. Nevertheless, the heavy workload demanded by tertiary institutions might not be suitable for all students. Indeed, quite a few young adults would find daily lectures and assignment deadlines tedious and stressful, hence would probably be miserable and anxious throughout their university years. In short, although further education offers high-quality coaching, it is not the answer for everyone.\n\nIn respect to going to work right after secondary school, it fails to supply youths with in-depth knowledge about their subjects. Without attending an institute, one's access to academic resources, such as research articles or books, is significantly reduced. Moreover, there are concepts that are difficult to grasp if there is no explanation from a professor, which means that self-studying will likely be laborious. Due to these limitations, skipping higher education seems not to be a good choice. On the other hand, entering the workforce early on equips youngsters with valuable pragmatic knowledge. For instance, actually working for a marketing company teaches one more about how promotion is done than any school can. That is to say, getting an occupation immediately after high school compensates for the lack of in-depth understanding with familiarity with real-life situations.\n\nIn a nutshell, when a fruitful career is concerned, there are strengths and weaknesses to both attending university and finding employment straight after school. Tertiary institutions offer young people a sufficient understanding of a subject but might be overwhelming for some. Contrastly, though directly joining the workforce means forfeiting useful academic resources, one can obtain just-as-valuable work experience. As a result, there is no one-for-all formula for a successful career, and individual youths have to decide for themselves what the best option is."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

We have an overreliance on the artificial intelligence of robots that we are not able to do a simple thing in daily life. Such an example is that many people have lack ofdriving skills because of good support on car driving and when drivers get to difficult situations, they may not know how to control the car exactly.

First and foremost, high-advanced technologies save an incredible amount of time and effort for us to do many things. A washing machine, for example, only needs to be set up at the start and after that, we have no need to do anything until the washing is done. On the macro side, robots bring  larger profits but reduce  costs for many companies and factories. Technological instruments allow us to do a lot of difficult and dangerous tasks such as lifting heavy objects or building skyscrapers without worrying about injuries. There is a fact that a huge number of hazardous injuries are reduced by the appearance of advanced tools. Besides, installing robotic facilities costs cheaper than paying salaries for a number of workers so it saves lots of money.\n\nIn conclusion, we are now living in a century where that artificial intelligence and robots become common. And although some disadvantages of robots are shown, we can deny that robots have also a lot of advantages."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Some believe that buying other countrie's agricultural  goods providing more benefits, while others opine that people should support their local farmer's goods instead of imported. I agree with a latter opinion and this essay shall discuss it briefly for the following reasons. \n\nOn the one hand, people should purchase their domestic food products rather than foreign goods because they should be supported to their local farmers unlikely any corporate companies that to make many profits by this. For instance, when the public consumes other nation's food stuffs while price of the agricultural products might be risen tremendously due to including the  imported tax and travel expenses. In addition, this trend might be continue in future many farmers could be lost their employment along with the agricultural land will be substitued by companies and enterprises, as an consequence, air pollution will be increased and some pesticites will be also eliminated. Therefore, consuming the local farmer's product might be helped their livelihood development. \n\nOn the other hand, importing food products bring more positive effects to society. Many nations have unlimited resources to cultivate crops and food items but some nations do not have that while this import system help to fulfill their market demands. For example, in Taiwan is an itensive island with unlimited resources, they import many crops to the USA to satisfy their market demands. Furthermore, it will help to balance the food supply around the world and every people can get food equally without any food scarcity. Therefore, importing the agricultural goods provide the positive effect to society. \n\nTo conclude, although importing food products can satisfy to other countries food item's demand as well as can be balanced the food supply, food products price can be increased by the import tax and travel expense as well as consuming the local agricultural items might be improved the local farmer's livlihood.

I think in a reverse manner and disagree with the given statement. My inclination is justified in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\nOut of all the arguments of teenage community work without salary, the strongest one to prove my opinion is everyone in this world would like to be a part of something only when there is some output of doing something. This is to say if a person doing something and does not get paid he would definitely not thinking to give his 100% to the team. For example, Trainee engineer in the compies in only their to learn some basic skills and he would not think about the group future, if he gets paid than he only not think about his own but also he would participate to raise company profits. Besides this, it is also true that in their free time teenagers have their own hobbies to pursue which would help them to relax. By ,this I mean working for something is always have stress on the mind and physical toughness whereas enjoying something would help them to a better person in future.\n\nThe other reason to prove my point is in small age they not that much developed  that they can improve the efficiency of the workplace because they not yet experienced this kind of stuff. In addition, the fact that under 18 pupils always want to have fun rather than working for a company is also logical.\n\nHowever, I would not overlook the other side too. To begin with, working in free time would help someone to achieve his goal as he would not be able to achieve it independently. Also, children get some exposure to the real world.\n\nTo conclude, it can be said that despite  pros of helping hand , my resond that teenager needs to be relaxed in their free time as well as try to find new ways for future are logically acceptable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Other believe that most crime is caused by people who are bad by nature.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion\nEssay: Whether criminals are a result contributed by numerous social factors or their own characteristics is an often-debated point. While I contend that social status leads to moral degradation and direct circumstances force offenders to be illegal, some critics suggest certain people have distinctive traits that can hardly be reshaped.\n\nIt is prominent that delinquency comes as a result of ethical degradation, which stems from the social status of offenders. This is to say, most people in lower castes of the social ladder usually encounter reprobates and social problems like drugs and prostitution. This guides them into a downward spiral of morality without proper intuition to lead them out, and committing a crime is the ultimate end of it. Rehabilitation centres are renowned for their ability to reform crime offenders, however, their jobs are simply to educate ethics to criminals, which surprisingly they never really get informed about, further indicating the ongoing issue concerning the downward spiral.\n\nNevertheless, people justifying the idea of criminals being bad by nature suggest individuals have specific personalities and sets of behaviours unique to any other. To break it down, if people are naturally born to be bad, this will progress into detrimental behaviours later on. This personality cannot be shaped, thus, leading to possible crime offences. While this point has validity, it has underacknowledged the role of education. If properly educated, a person can still know the foundations of moral behaviour and will be able to impede their own characteristics so as to be citizens of society.\n\nIn my viewpoint, most people commit crimes because they are forced to. A lot of criminal cases suggest the reason behind this is social problems directly relating to their lives, like poverty or tension. At the time of the offence, however good they are as a  person, their morality simply got overforced by the problems, which they failed to impede. Hence, this writer is swayed by social problems.\n\nIn retrospect, while critics argue personalities cannot be reshaped, proponents including myself suggest moral degradation, foundations, and forced actions advocate the role of social problems in driving criminals into illegal activities. Hence, this essay should have proven that people commit crimes not by nature but from social influence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem . Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation . Discuss both views and give your opinion .\nEssay: People have different views about whether we should take action to improve the living environment of animals and plants. While some people think it is too late to change this situation,  I believe that we can do a lot of things to effectively protect wildlife.\n\nFrom my point of view,  humans can take many measures to promote the protection of animals and plants. For example, through the establishment of nature reserves, we can protect forests and many endangered plants, and improve the habitat of wild animals and gradually eliminate the risk of extinction. China's protection of giant pandas is a very successful case.  Also, governments can introduce legislation to prohibit illegal felling of trees, the trade of wild animals and wild animal products, which can greatly reduce the number of endangered wild animals being hunted. By these measures, many species of plants and animals can thus avoid the fate of extinction.\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand the arguments against the protection of plants and animals. The main reason for this view is that the survival and development of human beings are more important compared with protecting wild lives.  Humans need a better living environment and more natural resources, so we have to occupy more forests and the habitat of wild animals. Another possible reason for this opinion is that many kinds of wild animals have become extinct, and we can no longer change this situation and we should focus on more important things.\n\nIn conclusion, although human beings are facing great difficulties of raising such a large population, it seems to me that we should do our best to protect plants and animals, these actions can improve the environment of humans in return and better support the development of the globe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effect on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: With the dramatic technological innovation, robots are widely used in all aspects in the world. In this case, an argument - whether robots are positive or negative - exists. In the following contents, two opinions will be analyzed and the evaluation will be presented. \n\nThe advantage of this phenomenon is obvious: the increase of profitability. For firms, the usage of robots can decrease the variable costs since there is no need for robots to offer salaries and insurances. Consequently, the marginal cost of each product declines significantly, which enables producers to obtain more profits. For instance, Hongqi, a vehicle manufacturer, successfully reduced its total costs for over 30% in 2020 by hiring robots with AI technology that took over about half of its workers. \n\nHowever, it also creates issues. When robots are used, to reduce costs - as what has been mentioned above - companies prefer robots instead of human employees; thus, structural unemployment exists since people are taken over. This leads to various problems in both economy and society. First, when the massive unemployment occurs, a lot of people lose sources of wages, which, in a macro perspection, leads to the larger Gini Index caused by the income distribution inequality. Moreover, since individuals have no money, the only way for them to survive is becoming criminals. Therefore, the crime rate is also going to rise in an unexpected way. \n\nIn conclusion, it is doubtless that the application of robots can provide firms with larger profit, while it also brings numerous unemployment rate which leads to further inequality and crime rate. Hence, benefits and limitations exist simutaneously. Robots can be used, but in a controlled and proper way such as the combination of both mankind and auto employees."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

While some people assert that the primary aim of this should be transforming students to responsible citizens and dedicated workers instead of focusing individual's talent and behaviour, I completely disagree with this notion. \n\nTo begin with, there are a number of reasons to support my view that concentrating on unique talents and characters of different students is quintessential. First and foremost is that monitoring and understanding the individuality of every child help to discover their personality, which, in turn, transform them into responsible citizens. This is because each child is blessed with a varied behaviour some can be short-tempered and some patient, some conserved and some friendly, therefore, it is necessary to look after every trait and educate them accordingly in order to make them capable to deal with the society. For instance, in the USA, students in Kindergarten are assigned with teachers according to their behavioural aspect in order to understand them completely and to help them to become a mature person.\n\nSecondly, my opinion is further bolstered by the factor that a focus on an individual's skill and talent is essential to provide them with a bright career. The reason for this is opting a profession of one's own interest usually lead to success and satisfaction as complete dedication and passion are generally involved in this. For example, with reference to the statistics of 'The Time', 70% of the successful people in the world are the ones who followed their innate talents. In contrast, if the purpose of teaching will only involve turning students to qualified doctors, engineers and bankers, then their inner skills will gradually vanish.\n\nIn conclusion, although academic education aims at nurturing the children with good manners and moulding them to skilled professionals, in my perspective, focusing on the characters and skills of every student not only help to discover their unique personality but also tread their paths to successful careers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Some people argue that this field would overtake all the work done by humans. In my opinion, to an extent, it can be possible, however, there are some jobs that will still use the human labour  rather than using robots.\u00a0\n\nTo begin with, robots have overtaken many job positions currently. When it comes to companies which produce cars, technology and food, it is pretty likely to see robots in their production lines  performing  most of the duties,  because of the accuracy and  the efficiency that they have. One robot might do several tasks at the same time, whereas one person can possibly do only one task and require more time. Furthermore, the artificially intelligent robots provide various benefits. While employees need to get paid, vacations and insurances, robots will only require installation process and maintenance, which is pretty convenient for the company cost.\n\nHowever, I believe that there are still some jobs that cannot be done by artificially intelligent robots. Firstly, the medical field is likely to remain requiring doctors. For instance, Although there are some robots that can undertake a surgery, the doctors are still domain most of the medical procedures and researches due to the complexity of the human body and their experience.  Secondly, the jobs regarding with the economy and administration are more likely to require people who can predict future crisis and economical approaches.

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?\nEssay: In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.\nThe first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.\nConsequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.\nTo sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

According to my opinion, I strongly agree this viewpoint as it can assist the youths to be agile and energetic plus to develop various interpersonal skills. Also, the local governments can reduce their yearly estimated cost of doing different community work if adolescents extend their helping hands. This essay will explain the reasons behind my agreement. \n\nThe most crucial point for supporting this idea is that participating in part-time charity projects like gardening or arranging a cycling camp during holidays can boost up the fitness level of teenagers so that they can be more active and joyous in their regular activities like studying or involving in a pretty specialized task that require more brainstorming. In addition, doing voluntary activities give them a chance to interact with different types of people of the community which definitely assists them to grow numerous social skills like active listening and emotional intelligence that can have an impact on their future life. \n\nOn the other hand, local community can also be benefitted from such unpaid work.

The essay below will discuss the reasons and positive and negative implications of this situation.\n\nAs for causes, more women began their work other than holding onto housework, and it led to older parents and younger children. According to one research, while there was only 10 percent of females who earned their own salaries in the 1980s, we now find that almost every woman enters a university and has her own job. Because of employment, promotion, and other reasons, people choose to have babies later. In addition, expensive properties resulted in this circumstance. Since it becomes more difficult to afford a house and to earn an abundant living for their family members, folks spend more time while saving money on their own rather than raising a child, which is common in South Korea.\n\nSubsequently, there are more benefits than drawbacks. At first, it is admittable that it may result in some health issues given that these mothers have babies in their late thirties or forties. Doctors find it hazardous for both mothers and babies to bear a life when mothers are old. On the contrary, people can focus on their achievements rather than being under social pressure, which has enforced individuals to raise a child or more. Consequently, there will be more people feeling bliss and society will be brighter.\n\nTo sum up, there are a lot of individuals who have babies not when they are young, since more women participate in societal activities.

This essay will examine both sides of the argument, and present my opinion in the end.\n\nOne of the reasons for the high salaries of managers is that they undertake more risk to the organization. Directors are responsible for dealing with the crisis of the company, which ordinary workers don't have to do. For example, directors must make necessary methods to save the company from the inflation problem. Therefore, the more responsibility managers have, the more money they should get.\n\nThe main reason that people think the gap between directors and workers is unfair must be they think they work for the company as hard as those directors as well and are also a crucial part of the business. It is no doubt that a company is unable to run without those ordinary workers. For example,  a car company will go bankrupt as soon as possible if all the assembly workers strike. Thus, it is reasonable that ordinary workers should get the same pay as their managers.\n\nIn my opinion, directors should be paid more than workers because they have more responsibility and risk to face. When the company breaks down, the workers can easier to find another job if their skills are professional enough, but as for directors, they need more fortune to pay the mortgage and loan coming with bankruptcy, and they also need more foundation to restart their business.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that directors of organizations deserve higher salaries than ordinary workers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is sometimes argued that the main approach of education is leading children to become well-behaved citizens, rather than to bring them benefits as individuals. In my opinion, I totally agree with that viewpoint because of some reasons that I will mention in this essay.\n\nFirst and foremost, the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them  become beneficial to society. Almost the time that students spend at school is for learning logical and social subjects which are crucial to cultivating their thinking and behaviour in society in the future. Moreover, this knowledge may be practical in work and help them to get more achievement in their career paths. For example, governments put Physics as a compulsory subject in the education system in each country to improve their learning for students who want to become researchers and engineers and move up the career ladder in the future.\n\nSecondly, benefiting students may make them more selfish and self-important in many ways. This means students could be paid more attention at school. However, catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations, and they may have bad behaviour to improve their opinion. For instance, to protect their opinion, some students may have violence and have some wrong methods to change others' thinking. Meanwhile, teachers may allocate more time to look after their students and may have some difficulty changing their teaching method due to justifying students' actions if they have any bad behaviour in the education area.\n\nIn conclusion, I concur that school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields, instead of benefiting them as they desire. In addition, parents can become their children's partners with the support from schools to help them to acquire more knowledge and not to overprotect them.

With more people entangled in their daily workloads, lesser emphasis has thus naturally been on cooking the meals at home, and more so, the hoopla of managing both has certainly been overwhelming and making one feel work like a trojan. In such a \u201cclick and flick\u201d era where a significant number of people may approach their fast-food outlets easily, simply putting a higher price quotation couldn\u2019t ever curb people from consuming and feasting on junk food. More so, as is found in a survey, people falling in the bracket of the upper class with an above-average income, are found to be the steadfast consumers of such packaged and unhealthy meals. Hence, as is pretty comprehensible, raising the prices of these eatables wouldn\u2019t make much of a dent in the pockets of people who may afford it easily. \n\nThe wages of people in concomitance to what they could frugally spend would be negligible, even after upheaving the taxes on such edible items. The striking need of the hour is to make people more aware of the cataclysmic causes of having such food that might render them extremely unhealthy and frail. Acknowledging people with the detrimental corollary and pernicious eventualities of having an imbalanced diet and a decrepit BMI may keep them alarmed and watchful of what they are being served or choose to be served with to eat.

Discuss both views and give your opinion\nEssay: While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.\n\nOn one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic widening, if improved, can lead to a decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to the economic success of a country for example, if a person gets a quality education, it will lead to the self-advancement of that individual which in turn can be aligned towards the developing the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacturing and sale goods, services, etc. As a result ,this  will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he/her from sufferings like poverty.\n\nOn the other Flank, adverse effects can be reflected by economic development. for instance, in a recent ,study it was highlighted that due to increased purchasing power and living, a vast majority of people have occupied a lot of land, food, etc. which in turn creates a depletion of resources.furthermore because of the rapid growth, companies that have shared this growth have started deteriorating  nature through the release of harmful gases and pollutants from big industrial factories. this all makes the government officials as well the general public  rethink  the economic widening.\n\nHaving discussed the dichotomy, what I opine is that economic development is essential. As if an economy improves a lot of suffering can be mitigated. Although there are few worse effects that give a  bad reputation for this growth,  still it leads a country towards innovation.\n\nTo sum up, it can be rightly reiterated that economic growth is vital even though the demerits of this exist it should be considered equally and improving the lives of individuals will lead to prosperity and happiness instead of starvation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\nEssay: In a number of countries, there is an increase in people who are curious about seeking out the history of their own residences and buildings. The causes of this are because people want to confirm the possibility that their houses could have a sinister history, or it could be otherwise instead. To find out about this, people can seek information from the elders who are still living around the neighbourhood, or they can go to their town\u2019s Housing and Development Center instead. \n\nOn one hand, some individuals are afraid of the possibility that their places to stay could have a scary background. They believe that this could cause their places to become haunted or become a source of bad omens for their families. On the contrary, many people are hoping that their houses harboured an exciting history instead. This could significantly increase the price of their houses, which they could sell afterwards. For example, in 2010, what seemed to be an ordinary house was actually discovered to be Michael Jackson\u2019s childhood home, and the price instantly soared.\n\nTo confirm the information regarding their building\u2019s past, people can first look for elders who still live near their buildings for more insights regarding their previous owners.

Some people think that only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In metropolitan cities, the shortage of accommodation is turning into a severe burden for citizens and some are of the opinion that this issue can be tackled solely by the actions of a government. I completely agree with this argument and I will fortify my view in the following paragraphs.\u00a0\n\nOne reason why I believe the government can deal with this problem is that it holds the right to imply new rules and policies and there are some sounding rules which would be logical to introduce. For example, if they apply a rule regarding the encouragement of the construction of high-rise buildings and prohibition of the old landed houses, more people can dwell in flats and this results in a considerable amount of land saving. In contrast, if the authority would not take such a precaution, there wouldn't be enough space for the forthcoming citizens.\u00a0\n\nAnother outstanding solution would be enticing people, who live in the rural areas, away from migrating to big cities. In order to maintain this, power owners should convince or force factories and companies in relocating their businesses to these outskirts. By doing that, new job opportunities can be created for those who are desperately looking for ways to migrate with the hope of finding a job. As a result, local people might convince away from moving. For instance, in Istanbul, many big financial companies moved their headquarters to different cities and this significantly reduced the rate of migration to Istanbul.\n\nIn conclusion, the shortage in housing evidently creates a crisis among the citizens of big cities, and I think, the role of government is essential due to their right to change laws in the ways of solving this crisis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

In my point of view, robots are helpful because they make our  modern life effortless. This thesis statement clearly shows some upsides and downsides of this topic.\n\nThe first and foremost benefit is improving the service. For instance, I have seen numerous robots in a smart country like South Korea. One of them was a coffee machine which can make beverages with no human presence. They use them at  restaurants, factories and other places. The reason is work that they rapidly operate. Therefore, people are replaced by machines. On the contrary, quick work is not a good job. They can not ensure quality like people and one day they can be destroyed. Furthermore, it is quite expensive to have it at your business and it does not guarantee customers coming. So we need to pay attention to them.\n\nOn the other hand, the majority of people are fired because their employers prefer to commute the workers with robots. Consequently, they do not have to pay a salary for them. Hence, the profit of a company is increased and it is a beneficial reason for having them.\n\nIn brief conclusion, the population continue to explore and make up new technologies which can replace humans.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is said that governments are to take more account of helping people tackle the illness and disease problem, compared to environmental pollution and house pricing. I strongly believe that these problems all should be solved appropriately.\nThe reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that most of the citizens who hope the government pay more attention to heath problem are relatively underprivileged in terms of economic and medical conditions. By contrast, those who view the environment and living condition as important as basic health put more emphasis on long-term and sustainable development. Since they believe that a healthy and flourishing natural environment is essential for healthy human societies. Without that, the people of that nation must breathe that contaminated air and utilise that polluted water, and this can have detrimental effects on people\u2019s physical health and well-being.\nHowever, there are some disadvantages. If governments put in all investment in these areas, they could be faced with a heavy financial strain, which could inhibit the development of the country. But overall, I think this is unlikely today, authorities would be well-advised to formulate a suitable financial strategy depending on the specific situation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly convinced that the situation government faced is more complex.

While the phenomenon gives rise to a variety of pollution, there are also some methods that we can use to solve problems.\n\nIn order to face the increasing number of productions, thousands of factories are established to enhance production and promote revenue. Most of those take advantage of fossil fuels to generate power for the use of production. Nevertheless, it would contribute to an amount of toxic air pollution and discharge sewage.

Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\nEssay: In today\u2019s modern society, there are certain individuals who absorb information on the internet. Although storing information online has some drawbacks, I am firmly convinced that the benefits are more significant.\n\nOn the one hand, some demerits of storing information on the internet have to be put forward. To begin with, the information uploaded on the internet can be non-selective because everyone can upload any information without being censored. Thus, these pieces of information may become unreliable. Therefore, it may be difficult for individuals to identify what is right or wrong. In addition, using the internet to obtain information is not always available . This is mainly because people do not always have the ability and devices to access the internet. For example, it is hard for users to get any information when the wifi is disconnected, but they can read a paper book at any time.\n\nOn the other hand, it is my firm belief that using online sources to acquire knowledge is more efficient. The first reason is that the internet provides readers with an unlimited source of knowledge. As a result, it is easier for them to study and research to find anything with a few clicks. For instance, Wikipedia is an example that provides information on all fields to the public. The second reason is that the use of the internet for information brings certain convenience to students and teachers. To illustrate this point, a lot of schools have their own online libraries for their students. By doing this, students can borrow books to study at home without having to go to their schools.\n\nIn conclusion, while there could be some troubles when storing knowledge on the internet such as non-selective information and the difficult access in certain situations, I firmly believe that the merits regarding convenience and the amount of information outweigh the demerits."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Some sets of people disagree that the painting lecture is a waste of both time and money, conversely, others believe the painting will bring various benefits of young children's growth. I personally agree with the latter opinion, and I will write both sides of view.\n\nIn the first place, some folks think that teaching painting does not an effective way to all children. For instance, some children are indifferent to drawing or creating something,  educating craft skills should be considered all young kids' personalities and interests. More specifically,\u00a0a boy who is not interested in technique class, then he hard to focus on the lecture, compared to other pupils who are eager to learn the drawings. Furthermore, some parents who prioritise practical lesson than potential value argue that students should learn mathematics or science than drawings. They believe that Investing money to practical subjects are more valuable than abstract subjects.\n\nOn the flip side, some parents and instructors agree with the idea that art is vital to children's development. On top of that, from the perspective of young students, creative activities help to develop their imaginations and creativity. This is because, drawings and creating lead understand another perspective, for example, when give a kid a topic that draw the happiest moments of their parents, the kid will remind his or her memories, and will draw certain moment with imagination. These lectures will help to raise understandings of others'. Secondly, as far as the nature of art is concerned, it leads to express one's thoughts or feedings through artwork. It will help to not mature children, especially, introverted kids who cannot speak their idea without adult's assistants. In this case, teachers or parents will understand more via the kid's artwork, and recognize their feeling than before.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the pupil's development stage and a certain exception case, I strongly believe that the creative activities will play a pivotal role at school.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.\nEssay: The environmental problem caused by human activities, especially the usage of vehicles, is getting worse. It has been argued that the effective way to diminish this issue is  raising the price of fossil fuels, which are widely used by most of the transportations. This essay agrees with that statement. Firstly, it can suppress the tendency of people transporting with their own cars. Secondly, it can encourage citizens to use public transports that are cheaper than their own vehicles. \n\nThe main reason is that it can reduce the number of people using their private vehicles. For example, most of the millennial people prefer to use cars rather than walking to go nearby. If this occurrence happens across the world, it can contribute to more than 50% air pollutants that are stored in the environment and it might worse our world conditions.  Therefore, increasing the tariff of this non-renewable source can be the practical way to lessen its effects. \n\nAnother supporting fact is that it can encourage people to pick public transportations to travel. Expensive fuels may impose  all kinds of automobiles. However, we can make it easier and lighter by sharing this extravagant cost together through the usage of public transportations, such as bus, tram, and train.  Thus, we can still travel with cheaper tariff and lowering the impact of non-renewable sources.\n\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my belief that the rising cost of fuels that are used by vehicles can be implemented to reduce the environmental issue because it encourages people to diminish the usage of  non-renewable resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?\nLet us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).\nMoreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.\nOn the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes.

While some people believe that it is vital for children to indulge into artistic skills and it should be part of their curriculum, there are many who vindicate this idea and consider it as a waste of time.  In this essay, I will illustrate both the views and explain why I believe that art should be taught to all the students in schools.\n\n\n\nFrom a parent perspective, there are many reasons why they don't want to encourage their offsprings to learn art as an essential subject in schools. First of all, many believe that there is not secure and stable future for the jobs in these areas. Indeed, many have to struggle comparatively more to prove themselves than traditional academic oriented jobs. Additionally, there are some demographic practices among rigid religions that also detain their children to delve into such artistic skill developments. Although in my opinion these are just conservative beliefs and more awareness is required for the parents.\n\n\nIn my perspective, there are many underlying benefits of learning art, especially in the early years of education. One of the predominant factor is that it helps children to expand their imagination and creativity, which opens up their mind to vast opportunities that one can't even imagine. Many scientific research, for instance, space exploration actually started with the imagination of painters and singers. There is an unexplainable link between academic and art education. Another significant benefit, which is also scientifically proven is that art helps in reducing stress and improves one's mental well being. Recent studies have shown that children who are involved in extra curricular activities like dance, singing, painting in their elementary years of education, are less prone to depression and anxiety when they grow up. Undoubtedly, there are many positive aspects to learn art in schools.\n\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion, while I agree that there could be more struggles in finding a secure and stable occupation in the field of art, yet it is very important that we encourage our children to participate in at least one of the art skills, irrespective of whether they pursue any career in it or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Therefore, this has become a debatable issue whether the effects of globalization such as the same products and shops  are detrimental or undeniably beneficial. This essay will shed light on these stated perceptions and discuss my point of view in conclusion. \n\nOn the one hand, owing to the availability of different stock in terms of varieties as compared to the past, the reach of the common public has increased. This is to say when ordering from abroad, only wealthy families were able to buy imported things because they were sufficiently capable of paying the extra charges incurred in terms of shipping and tax. Apart from this, import and export business has dwelled between countries, thus, making the economy of involved nations prosper in a positive direction.

Moreover, it also stated that this booming economy created 45% more job opportunities which further helped it to rise. \n\nOn the other hand, globalization caused local vendors serious problems. To simply this, the society took less interest in local brands in contrast to the merchandise from foreign companies, thus, due to the continuously diminishing popularity of native items, lots of shops got closed and people went jobless.

Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodworking should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family.\n\nTo that extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: A rapidly evolving world necessitates fundamental changes to educational institutions. While traditional subjects like mathematics, science, and literature are undoubtedly important, I strongly believe that schools should also incorporate practical skills such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodworking into their curricula.\n\nOn the one hand, teaching practical skills at home enables students to acquire essential life skills that are often overlooked in traditional academic settings. For instance, many parents consider it a responsibility to teach their children knowledge of nutrition, meal planning, and culinary techniques. By learning to prepare their own meals, young people can gain a deep understanding of healthy eating habits, portion control, and the value of balanced nutrition. These skills not only contribute to their physical well-being but also empower them to make informed choices about their diet, leading to a lifelong impact on their health. This process is best done in families where habits can form in the long-term.\n\nHowever, incorporating practical skills into the curriculum promotes a well-rounded education catering to diverse needs and interests. Not all students excel in academics, and by providing alternatives, schools can tap into the potential of students who might otherwise feel marginalized or disengaged. For example, a student who struggles with academic subjects might discover a natural talent and passion for woodworking. By nurturing their interest and providing opportunities to develop their woodworking skills, the student gains a feeling of purpose and accomplishment, boosting their overall engagement and motivation. In a fashion class, a student can learn to design, measure, cut, and sew garments. Both classes instill a sense of pride if students can produce useful wood objects or wear garments they have crafted themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, rather than relying on families, schools should prioritize incorporating practical skills into the curriculum while also maintaining rigorous standards for the current core subjects. By doing so, students will have a more comprehensive education that equips them with both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

One of the most important problems is air pollution as a result of using fusile fuel for transportation or industry. People believe that government should concern about it and the hazard impacts of it should be controlled by increasing the price. Although I agree with this, I think there are many appropriate alternative solutions to solve the problem.\n\nOn the one hand, the first solution to reduce oil consumption is that governments raise the price of it. People prefer to use private cars for their daily transportation and even their journeys. Hence, they decrease using own cars if they have to more investment. Although authorities can reduce the amount of fuel and its impact, it does not properly work in long term. For instance, national law for increasing taxes on tobacco goods cannot help to solve the problem of using those products and I think that legislation on oil price does not work as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the authorities ought to apply alternative solutions for this situation. Firstly, public transportation should be increased and people encourage not only to use of public transportation like metro or taxi but also using bicycles and electrical scooters instead of their private car. Secondly, people should aware of the impact of increasing carbon emissions on the atmosphere. Thirdly, governments should investigate renewable energies for use on cars and other vehicles.

Only government action can solve this problem.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Housing shortage in cosmopolitan cities can be attributed to two main factors: insufficient supply of residentials areas and rapid surge of population. The government, having the highest authority, has a pivotal role in regulating supply of houses to citizens. Thus, I firmly believe it is only through government led movement that alleviation of the problem could be realised.\n\nSome may propose that land developers and citizens have a role in aggravating the housing problems: developers can accelerate the process of building housing estates, while citizens can move to areas further away from city centre to reduce the congestion. Of course, these would rely on their conscience, which is often lacking. Who wouldn\u2019t want to live in the proximity of their workplace or school, with all the shops and daily necessities in place? My friend, for instance, prefered to live in Sydney in a tiny flat as she felt it was extremely convenient, rather than go back to suburban areas which was remote and isolated. With the government\u2019s policy in place, giving monetary incentives or welfare rewards to those who comply with increasing residential supply, the scheme would be much more efficient.\n\nIt is crystal clear that the government has the highest power to enact changes in society. They can design policies to ensure adequate supply of land is provided for residential use, as well as putting a limit to the population rise, therefore reaching a balance between man and space. Singapore is a glaring example, where the authorities have put together reasonably priced and spacious public housing estates for its citizens in the past decades, relieving the pressure on living space. Hong Kong, on the contrary, without such large scale public housing plans in place, finds itself constantly lacking in quality apartments to house the needy. \n\nWithout the officials led change, it is extremely difficult and inefficient to ease the pressure on housing supply.

This essay will present both views of this contentious argument and argue why I believe parents' supervision is crucial.\n\nAdvocates believe that television and computer games yield positive effects on young children. Firstly, they emphasise that these pastimes could have a tremendous educational impact on young people. There are various tv channels that offer diverse programmes that go beyond the school's curriculum, and children are attracted to watch and merrily expand their knowledge. My nephew, for instance, views the Discovery Channel to experience the lives of the Amazon tribes. Another benefit is that children can develop cognitive abilities. Online games such as the Civilisations, require to build an empire and battle to survive, and when played in groups, users have to communicate and collaborate to achieve their goals. As such, spending more time on computer games will assist these young group to cultivate essential problem-solving and teamwork skills that are necessary for their adult life.\n\nNevertheless, others highlight the worry impacts of digital gaming and television on young people. Their primary concern is health. Adolescents face difficulty with moderation and they can watch television for 6 hours on end. This will lead them to breed a sedentary lifestyle which results in obesity, diabetes and posture problems. Additionally, opponents contend that spending lengthy hours on screens will stall their social skill development. Games such as Suki are also played solo and the lack of engagement might lead them to be self-centred and less expressive. In this regard, my consent lies with this group as socialisation should be the key ability that needs to be cultivated in their early childhood.\n\nTo conclude, while the educational and cognitive benefits of children playing computers and watching tv are immense, I believe that parents should strictly discipline their children from using these devices as their health conditions may deteriorate and they might not be able to learn social skills."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

In this eassy, i will discuss the viewpoint and give relevent ideas about the issue.\n\nTo begin with, young adults are less matured compared to adults this is why they should not be considered in same punishedments.Furthermore, sometimes they are more susceptible to being afflicted by bad peers or role models.To make an exmaple, many of them may join the aggressive gangs,in which they commit a sort of illegal works like; smoking, teasting, hijacking and so on. Therefore, the youth should not be punished the same as the grown man who committing the types of offensive words.\n\nBesides, less proper guidance and violations from one's parents can be the main reasons for youngstars becoming criminals.In addition , nowadays parents are often busy with work so that they may be involved with some unwanted crimes like stealing something pen,pencil,sharpner and many more.To explain , punishments must be more flexible for children having such backgrounds.

Why? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\nEssay: In recent decades, lots of people choose to give birth to babies when they become older, unlike in the past when many people became parents at a younger age. There is a multitude of reasons for this phenomenon. In this essay, the reasons will be illustrated. Although there are good arguments in favour of having children at a younger age, I personally believe that becoming parents at a later age is a better option.\n\nThere are two main reasons why citizens now choose to give birth to babies at a later age. People nowadays enjoy freedom more than those in the past. When compared to the previous ages, citizens now have more entertainment and leisure activities than before. With the fascinating activities, people are keen to relish freedom and youth before settling down for children. A striking illustration is that people are amused by going on trips as travelling abroad is now more common than in the past. Having babies at a young age hinders people from travelling, as taking care of them occupies one's life completely. With this in mind, people incline to have children later. Another reason to note is because of the immense financial burden brought by having children. Citizens usually settle down after their career is developed due to the enormous expenditure spent on children. In the present day, people often hope to give the best things to their children. The expenses, be it tuition fees or medical fees, are massive. In order to allow their children to have the best things, an increasing number of people choose to give birth after their career is developed. \n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages to this phenomenon. One of the drawbacks is the illnesses babies might have. A study from John Hopkins Hospital shows that the probability of children having special educational needs increases exponentially if a mother gives birth to them after the age of 35. \n\nDespite the aforementioned disadvantages, I believe that having children later brings more advantages. As said before, people having babies later will be more financially stable. Parents will not have to be worried about financial hardships and the family can focus on the physical and psychological development of children. Furthermore, parents giving birth later mean that they are more mature than young parents. It in turn leads to a solid and strong family basis, which is beneficial to children.\n\nUnder this line of thinking, although there are undeniably drawbacks of having children at a later age, it is believed that there are even more benefits."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.0"}]}

Whether rigorous penalties would be the most effective way to deter driving offences, is a very controversial issue. Although, I second that the implementation of harsher punishments could be the best solution for hindering the road accident, there are other methods which should be applied by the government for making people conscious about road safety.\n\nFirst and foremost, the implementation of rigid rules regarding road safety  proved to be fruitful. For example, in Vietnam, the citizens are punished for not wearing a helmet from $20 to $40.Fearing for this penalty, people never put off their helmet during driving. Moreover, if the government does not make that hard laws for the would-be offenders, it is possible that the law breakers would conveniently break the law. For instance, in Singapore, before 1980, the government did not impose any law regarding road casualties, which had caused many lives meaningless for their families and society. When the authority saw this, they started new rules and regulations which were the most effective in the long run.\n\nSimilarly, people have started to think about more measures that should be taken to minimize road injuries of death, regardless of the implementation of various types of law. The most effective one could be that the government should heighten people\u2019s awareness by the media. This, eventually, could help people to understand not only the bad impact of not abiding by rules such as wearing a helmet at the time of driving, maintaining traffic signals, but it also makes people conscious about their lives. The other measure is that encouraging people to use the public transport such as bus, train, et Cetra.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that rigorous penalties are the key to impede road accidents, raising people\u2019s consciousness and encouraging people to use public transports, in my opinion, could also be the best methods."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Although people are aware of health importance, they find it difficult to stop doing unhealthy activities which leads to a higher risk of health problems and serious living effects. This essay will discuss several causes and suggest some solutions to tackle this issue. \n\nThere are different reasons to explain this problem. This can be, firstly, explained by the fact that people are too engrossed in work to forget how important health is. Many adults not only work eight hours per day, but also they continue to do other part-time jobs with a stable income desire. Therefore, they have trouble balancing work and personal activities. Sometimes, addressing big workload requirements leaves them with hardly any choice but to do unsound activities, such as an irregular sleep cycle and erratic eating habits. Secondly, once people are addicted to unhealthy habits, it is difficult for them to regulate. For example, people with smoking habits cannot reduce their dependence on cigarettes due to their high addictiveness. Besides, it is also unable to bring people with a sedentary lifestyle to be more active because doing exercises or other physical activities seems to be bothering them.\n\nTo solve this problem, solutions are presented suggested as below. One of which is that a healthy lifestyle should be promoted in the working and life environment. For instance, educating and self-educating about the influences of lifestyle should be stimulated by launching online competitions involving healthy activities. In addition, employees should apply smart tools to manage and build scientific working schedules.

However, the future effect would be different as there would be more people  within the country needing employment. Then there might arise the problem of  unemployment.

In my opinion, there are certain reasons for this, and several measures can be taken to promote a healthier lifestyle.\n\nPeople choose wholesome food and exercise for their life for several purposes. The first reason for this is that the number of cancer patients because of unhealthy food has increased in recent years. Therefore, they may want to change their eating habits to avoid these deadly diseases. For instance, a lot of people nowadays do not consume reused cooking oil to avoid stomach cancer. The second reason for this is that some people want to keep in shape and have a perfect body. For these people, their appearance may be important in both daily life and the working environment. Thus, the best way to lose weight is to have a balanced diet and do exercise regularly. \n\nIn order to increase healthy habits, various approaches can be adopted. To begin with, information about the benefits of wholesome food should be widely spread. In other words, fresh food needs to be advertised on social networks and the internet more. Also, the cost of fresh food such as vegetables and fruits should be reduced to make it more affordable. Furthermore, the government should take action to promote citizens to do more exercise. This can be done with the setting up/installation of exercise facilities in public areas.

As an outcome, they tend to use natural sources like water for instance. This is because, in every production the role of water is crucial, but they release it back from where it was brought.

As I believe the ultimate goal of scientific research is to provide enhancements to human welfare, I think solving both world health and other issues are equally as important, and neither of which should be prioritized over the other.\n\nOn the one hand, solving world health problems is crucial to our existence as a species. In the past, there are many diseases that affects hundreds of millions of people, namely the plague or the smallpox, the latter of which has been entirely eradicated while very few people catch the plague nowadays, thanks to the extensive research into developing vaccines and preventative measures. Focusing on addressing global health issues can provide a boost to finding a cure many critical diseases, such as cancer, diabetes or malaria, which in turn can save countless lives. One prime case in point is the disease COVID-19 which has greatly disrupted everyone globally because of lockdowns, to  developing a vaccine two years later and everything is now back to normal.\n\nOn the other hand, putting an emphasis on solving world health issues can lead to neglection of other problems that are as equally as important. Regarding environmental problems, if these are not put into proper considerations, they can also pose a threat to our physical and mental well-being. If more scientific research are carried out to find solutions to pollution, global warming or loss of diversity, there could possibly be fewer people at risk of contracting diseases in the first place.

In my opinion, they should use social sites to connect with different communities around them, but with caution. Further in my essay, I will pen down a few benefits of using social applications, followed by their disadvantages.\n\nTo begin with, the primary advantage of using social media is eliminating the communication barrier caused due to distance. Moreover, one can update himself with the latest news that has been trending around the world. Also, getting to know different people globally proves beneficial in exchanging knowledge and different thought process, which assists in widening the perspective. For instance, one of the employment-oriented online services helps connect people with similar interests and gives an insight into various skillsets used across the firms. This can bring like-minded groups closer.\n\nOn the contrary, the over abuse of social platforms can lead to loss of valuable time, which otherwise could have been used for productive work. Furthermore, lately, the cybercrime rate has increased tremendously in the past few years. For example, recently, a woman was robbed by a fake profile who claimed to be a bank official. Since the practice of such platforms does not come with identity verification, which means there are high chances of confronting fake profiles.\n\nI believe that the advantages of using social media are more than its disadvantages because it helps exchange knowledge, and the only downside is its uncautious use.\n\nIn conclusion, if used cautiously, social media can help find like-minded people.

Governments all around the world, are dealing with this social issue in various ways.\n\nThere are quite a large number of people who tend to use their own vehicles instead of the public transportation system. To explain more, private cars provide owners with some beneficial opportunities that incite them to commute even long distances by them. In fact, drivers can choose every route they want on the map to get to their destination, also, it allows them to take detours whenever they want. In addition, the infrastructure of many major cities is inadequate for the high volume of traffic, so, more new routes and underpasses should be established to relieve the effects of this phenomenon. Furthermore, encouraging individuals to use the public mode of transport would be an effective resolution to reduce the amount of traffic.\n\nThe same opening and closing times of all organizations in one community can lead to traffic congestion. For more explanation, when most of the shopping malls, stores, and educational centers open or close at the same time, it may cause a peak time for traffic, whereas, the citizens tend to use their own cars at this time instead of the public mode of transport.

What can be done to improve the situation?\nEssay: In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students\u2019 academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position.

Some people argue that peer pressure is a disadvantage to young kids while others may say otherwise. I hold the same view as those that being influenced by friends is a good thing. \n\nTeenage life is when they often start to mature. This is where their life starts to find themselves and discover new friends. They often find friends that are a bad influence on them that could ruin their life. Furthermore, this is also the phase in life where they rebel against their parents. However, with the guidance of their family, bad behaviours can still be changed and good values are still taught at home. Peers should not be the ones moulding one's character hence family should understand and help them in any way. \n\nMoreover, young people that do not have a good relationship with their parents often find themselves valuable when they are with their peers. They are getting emotional support from their friends and families and are often misled by the idea that their character changed because of whom they hang out with that well, in fact, their personality is mostly caused by their environment at home. An emotional support system is important to young kids since they are still maturing at this age and having a good support system at an early age can help them grow into a better version of themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, there are more pros than cons in influencing young folks' actions due to peer pressure.

So happens, because graduates are introduced to a completely new environment, to which they were not prepared for. In this essay, I will try to recite factors that may have caused this and give my opinion on the situation.\n\n First of all, one of the factors that may have caused such an outcome, would be the education system in universities, which needs to be modernized. Because of it, university graduates are not prepared for a life outside of a school, therefore it causes difficulties in finding jobs in their chosen profession.

The reason for that is because young people already have a lot on their plates and any drastic change in their everyday life can cause a rather negative outcome.

In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. \n\nRegardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their martial and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don\u2019t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a collage degree or computer science graduation tend to lower their confidence at workplace or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures\u2019 families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instances in Asian countries people believe that men are bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.\n\nMany women activist across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As result of this, today many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their work force have equal number of women and men employee. Other than this IT sector need diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.\n\nTo conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

There are several reasons obviously cause this severe dilemma, and solutions could certainly be taken to tackle it immediately. \nThis alarming issue could be contributed by some following factors. First and foremost, the increase in the production of buyer products would trigger the natural resource depletion. Specifically, the more people produce user goods, the more natural resources are used during the manufacturing process, leading to the ecological imbalance. Deforestation is an evident example to satisfy the high demand of space for factories and plants, which can cause a host of serious complication for human beings like climate change and desertification. Another important factor is that more industrial waste is discharged directly from manufacturing factories into the environment. Consequently, this can lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future.\nIn terms of solutions, it is believed that both individuals and governments should join hands to mitigate the obstacle. At the level of individuals, each person should attempt to reduce their unnecessary consumption and change their throw-away behaviour. As a result, the decline in the demand of purchaser products will be the premise of slowing down the environmental degradation. Besides, national authorities should implement policies which force manufacturing factories adopt waste treatment systems and energy-saving equipment.

From my view, I completely agree with this viewpoint, but we still need to have different approaches to make this more effective.\n\nOn the one hand, it is obvious that raising the cost can bring many benefits to the people. To begin with, this action will make fast food become too expensive for consumers to afford on a daily basis therefore, making them reduce the consumption of this food type. For example, if Mcdonald\u2019s food prices are too high, people may not consume them anymore. Subsequently, it also leads to an increase in people who cook at home due to the fast food are not profitable compared to home-cooked food, which is healthier.\n\nOn the other hand, because overweight\u2019s cause// does not just come only from food so that raising the price is not enough, it should come with other approaches with people\u2019s help. Firstly, there should be campaigns that increase public awareness of disadvantages of fattening food and the benefits of exercising. Secondly, the government should provide policies that encourage the development and research of organic foods. For example, the authorities should reduce taxes that relevant with cultivating this type of food or make a budget for research intends to make a healthier meals.\n\nIn conclusion, while raising the price of these kinds of food can be important, it is not the only approach. To be effective, it must be accomplished with other methods and the help of society"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

It is true that people are fond of gathering information about the places such as their houses and buildings where they live. I am going to shed light upon the causes with the best possible solutions in subsequent paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with,the first and foremost reason behind this is that they want to know about the lifestyles and interesting things of their ancestors. To explain it,when individuals start researching the old properties,they get to know about the knowledgeable things of the previous era,like study about particulars which used to be there in earlier times, which have changed now. For example,nowadays,many monuments are driven after doing searches of some outdated places which are really helpful for upcoming generations and other scientific purposes.\n\nIn addition to it,another striking cause behind this idea is that it can connect people with their past,as they gain a better understanding of the humans who lived there before them. Moreover,they do so to know about natural phenomena in that place in order to protect their areas from natural disasters. For instance,areas which are prone to earthquakes and floods can be secured by studying the past time and by this,they can take possible measures to protect themselves.\n\nTo conclude,moving towards the best possible solutions, initially,they can do so by having a look at the registries and meeting with previous owners.

In my opinion, schools should aim to elevate the individual, not impose conformity.\n\nThose in favour of this statement argue the value of a well-functioning society. As the world develops and there are advances in medicine, safety, working conditions, and so on it is easy to forget that this level of comfort requires sacrifices for the common good. Individuals must work at companies to stimulate the economy and the public must have a basic sense of community in order to live peaceably with one\u2019s neighbours. School is where this education can begin. Teachers can explicitly and implicitly guide students to socially beneficial behaviours and educate them well enough to establish a viable future career.\n\nHowever, I would argue that focusing on the individual will accomplish the goals detailed above but also be mentally healthier. Students who are taught to share, work well in teams, and develop their talents will contribute to society as a byproduct of pursuing their own seemingly selfish interests. Moreover, there may be times when the focus on society will come at the cost of the mental health of individuals. For instance, students who are taught to withhold their personal viewpoints in school, as is common in many authoritarian nations, may harbour resentment and not feel they can fully express themselves in a free environment. Psychological research has shown that the key to healthy growth is feeling safe to express oneself without fear of reprisals and repercussions.\n\nIn conclusion, although there is a valid argument in favour of social stability, schools should aim to produce healthy, industrious individuals. Naturally, these goals are not mutually exclusive and the overlap should be emphasized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

While it is possible that all menial jobs will eventually done by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.\n\nRobots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. In supermarkets in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligence will be replaced.\n\nConversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. Put simply, some jobs require a 'human touch'. These jobs include psychology, education, medicine and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.\n\nIt is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment.

In my opinion, I totally believe that having university education is very crucial, however, having a job is also a good choice.\n\nOn the one hand, going to university is the best approach. First reason is that there will be more opportunities for who have a good qualifications. Take an example, having a good diploma or higher degrees, you will be hunted by headhunters from popular companies which then you would stand a greater chance of landing a well-paid job. The second reason, it is worthwhile to get knowledge from university or college which is the tool supporting almost of your works.

Many people believe that having a job suddenly after school is better because they can earn money as soon as possible. Nowadays, many have ideal that going further after school is unnecessary and it is also more expensive so they prefer to earning money suddenly after school.

Many experts opine that AI robots impose a threat to all human jobs. Personally, I am not in favour of the aforementioned notion and the following paragraphs will expatiate my stance with lucid examples.\n\nTo begin, although many of the manual errands can be done using bots, there are myriad activities that will need  human interference. To elucidate, there are many physical works that are conducted by a designated folk after verifying the process. For example,tasks such as attesting a document will always require a person to do it. Therefore, for  critical tasks, the presence of a human being is essential.\n\nSecondly, though artificial intelligent robots are smart enough, they lack emotional sense. There are many departments that deal with providing some offers to the client and acknowledge some bargaining on that. To illustrate, the insurance department has multiple plans for the customers, but many times they tweak these as per the consumer demand to serve them better.  As a result, it helps in gaining  customer satisfaction and companies often value it for making a profuse amount of profit by selling the product.\n\nTo sum up, despite the fact that AI has emerged as a boon for many jobs, it will never be able to replace all of them in the near future.

In the present essay, I will try to explain that alteration in climatic conditions has potential risks and so, societies,in general, should pay heed to the burning issue.\n\nGlobal warming is a serious obstacle and so, necessary steps are required to combat it. It can be done by several means: by imposing green taxes on the industries, vehicles, and other sources emitting greenhouse gases.

Some people say that the price increase of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Overweight represents a serious problem in most developed countries. Health conditions due to the comorbidities related to obesity rates are at the highest levels in history and so are the costs for public and private health services. To cope with this situation, strategies have been purposed in order to diminish the impacts of people becoming fatter as it will be discussed as follows. \n\nFirst, governments have been advised by experts to extra-tax processed and ultra-processed foods so the prices could be less attractive for the consumers. Items such as soft drinks, packaged bread and buns, chips, candies, ice creams, boxed cake mixes, instant noodles, for example, play a relevant role in fattening diets. Once these products are more expensive, more taxes could be collected to fund health services and then minimize the effects of overweight and obesity in society. Unfortunately, to be implemented, this strategy has to overcome the power of the food industry.\n\nProcessed food corporations invest a huge amount of money to influence people's habits to consume their high-levelled sugar and fat so colled delicious food. Furthermore, for generations, habits have been forged by competitors that literally mesmerize their potential costumers with attractive adverts especially conceived to satisfy the public's needs desiring unhealthy food. This multi-billionaire business invests millions to influence legislators and governments not to regulate their sector and limit their growth. So the lobbying activities represent and hurdle to the strategy of increasing those products prices.\n\nTo conclude, although I believe that the price rise of processed and ultra-processed foods can represent an inhibitive nudge for consumption, in many countries, the observed scenarios show that it is not enough to influence the development of better eating habits among populations that have been strongly influenced by powerful corporations to consume fattening foods."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

This is the first reason I disagree with this idea and secondly, if your motherland has a good economy, all things like exports, imports, deliveries to another nation will be easier. You can import seafood,agriculture, very easy or maybe you can get a good price for this. Therefore, in my opinion, an increase in economic wealth is always good and convenient for citizens in all countries.\n\nBut some people agree with the idea that if the platform of economic wealth was stronged, they wouldn't want to be richer for some reason.

Machines have no emotion so that they can do error-free work. In addition, with a specific schedule, they can work rapidly and accurately. Most importantly, we can use them in a workplace that is not safe for humans. This will increase efficiency and productivity. For example, I worked in a car factory years ago. By utilizing machines in paint and solder lines, labour injuries were declined significantly, and the production rate sped up.  \n\nIn contrast, some believe that people may lose their jobs by using more and more androids, especially in working-class careers. It could increase the unemployment rate, and folks cannot afford their life expenditure. There is a high chance that Crime activities or even family issues will rise since people need to cover their expenses in any way. As a result, society welfare will damage seriously. For instance, my cousin lost his job position to a robot, and a few months later, his wife demanded divorce due to his unemployment.\n\nIn conclusion, with technology development, automatons will do tasks side by side with the workforce in the future.

While I understand people\u2019s concern about environmental damage, I still believe to get rid of poverty and hunger economic growth is needed.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why people support the ban on economical growth. Firstly, owing to industrial growth, air and water pollution levels are shooting. For instance, recent surveys depict that industrial waste is one of the main reasons for polluting clean water resources. Moreover, carbon emission has been at its peak in the last decade due to the rise in the number of industries, which is essential for the economy. Secondly, deforestation, which is done to provide space to industries, is also a huge problem. Cutting down forests results in hampering the water cycle.

These points make people believe that economical growth has a bad impact on the environment.\n\nDespite these causes, I still believe to end hunger and poverty strong economy is vital.

Recently, Amazon has declared to open a warehouse in Orissa creating thousands of jobs in the state. In addition to this, a rising economy will help to provide more funds for deprived masses.

With increasing competition, businesses are promoting their products aggressively. Therefore, I believe customers are getting influenced immensely. This essay will discuss the consumers' response by these advertisements and some solutions.\n\n\nFirstly, there is a lot of false information that companies convey about their products. This leads to people believing everything they watch on television or online. The main reason is the cut-throat competition, and to survive they have to sell their products, no matter what. Agencies usually hire already popular celebrities, to gain everybody's trust. For instance, to promote health supplements, athletes are chosen, the customer starts connecting the healthy lifestyle and fitness of that sportsmen with the supplement. One possible solution to the problem can be, celebrities should research all about the brand before endorsing. It will ensure the audience gets the right product.\n\n\nSecondly, with marketing we end up having more items than we need. Misleading promotions are the main reason behind it. For example, if we ever see a luxury brand commercial, they always focus on rich people's lifestyle. This is because, they want to connect their brand with luxury, which has a little to do with the actual product. I feel, government should monetize these commercials, they should check the product's authenticity first, and any type of online marketing should also be checked.\n\n\nTo conclude, companies will always find loopholes in the system, to exploit it.

Others, however, think that other measures are needed. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay: Traffic congestion has become a ubiquitous challenge in urban areas, leading to increased commute times and environmental concerns. As urban populations continue to grow, the search for effective solutions intensifies. One school of thought asserts that providing free public transportation is the key to alleviating congestion, while an opposing viewpoint argues for alternative measures. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives, examining the advantages of free public transportation as well as the feasibility of alternative approaches. Ultimately, the goal is to weigh the merits of each stance and offer a comprehensive view on the most viable strategies to address the ever-growing issue of traffic congestion in our cities.\n\nSome proponents argue that providing free public transportation is the most effective solution to address traffic congestion. By removing the financial barrier to using public transport, more people are likely to choose it over private vehicles, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. For instance, in Singapore, the implementation of free bus services during peak hours resulted in a significant decrease in traffic volume, offering a practical example of the positive impact of this approach.\n\nOn the other hand, skeptics believe that alternative measures are necessary to combat traffic congestion. Congestion pricing, for instance, has proven successful in major cities like London and Stockholm. By charging drivers for entering the city center during peak hours, congestion pricing not only discourages unnecessary trips but also generates revenue for improving public transportation infrastructure. This demonstrates that a multifaceted approach may be more effective than relying solely on free public transportation.\n\nIn my opinion, while free public transportation can be a valuable component of a comprehensive strategy, it should not be the sole focus. Combining initiatives such as congestion pricing, the development of cycling infrastructure, and the promotion of carpooling can create a more sustainable and adaptable solution. This balanced approach addresses the diverse needs of urban populations and offers a more realistic path toward reducing traffic congestion in our cities.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over how best to mitigate traffic congestion in urban areas is complex and multifaceted. While advocates of free public transportation emphasize its potential to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, proponents of alternative measures, such as congestion pricing, highlight the need for a diversified approach. After considering both views, it is my contention that a balanced strategy, incorporating elements of free public transportation alongside other measures, presents a more realistic and sustainable solution. By embracing a comprehensive perspective, cities can not only enhance mobility for their residents but also contribute to the creation of more environmentally friendly and efficient urban environments. The path forward involves recognizing the intricacies of each approach and forging a synergistic strategy that addresses the unique challenges of individual urban landscapes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

For instance, wooden furniture is an essential commodity for people which is being made by cutting down  trees, thus impacting  nature and unbalancing the forests. Hence, the increasing  demand won't let the situation differ rather it will get worse as the demand rises with numbers.\n\nOn the flip side, actions can be taken related to the waste being produced by industries as it can be dumped at a place which causes a limited effect on animals. Similarly, there are ways to protect animals which are being killed for food in case there is no demand from people and they shift to going vegan as killing an animal for food is even worse for the human race as implied in a number of mythologies. Furthermore, steps can be taken by the government to curb the cutting down of trees along with implementing laws that help protect  wildlife and natural habitat from cruel human activities towards them.\n\nTo conclude, looking at the current scenario world is heading towards a situation where the flora and fauna would get diminish as  time progresses but there must be laws in place to protect the ecological balance that is of paramount importance for the natural habitat of animals and their living source that are  plants."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: People have contrasting views about what would be the ultimate goal of an educational institution. While some people opine that school should prepare their pupils as a productive member of society, I think they also should help these children to grow as a person meanwhile.\n\nFirstly, preparing children for employment will ensure their livelihood. If youngsters are provided market-based lectures & environments on their campus, it will create their base for professional life. Consequently, they will be competent by gaining the required knowledge and skills for being recruited by companies or start entrepreneurship. Thus, getting ready for future jobs at an early age helps the children to grasp opportunities in the future and earn their bread and butter. For example, in Bangladesh, the employment rate is 30% higher for the candidates who had graduated from the vocational training centre compared to general.\n\nHowever, developing children's personality will make them a happy person. An individual may be very successful in life by having a progressive career, yet he may be unhappy and depressed for other internal concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on child cognitive development and improvement of their interpersonal skill so that they could be able to make effective communication, differentiate right and wrong & tackle difficulties. As these young people spend a long time in school, soft skills would be effectively inculcated by them if they are being taught these in the classroom. For instance, punctuality and discipline, two vital qualities a pupil learn from their classroom, which benefits them life-long.\n\nIn conclusion, whether making students for future occupations or better characteristics should be the main target of an educational institution is a controversial issue.

Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people\u2019s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.\n\nLegislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, therefore, decreasing public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.\n\nSince personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn\u2019t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

Do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Traditions and standards of behaviour have long been integral parts of society, serving as a defining aspect of different nationalities and tribes. Today, there is a rising concern about the significance of those inheritances in modern society. I believe certain traditions should be preserved, while other customs, causing unnecessary burdens, should be eliminated from modern life.\n\nSome traditional and moral standards play a crucial role in preserving the identity of a nation and serving a good purpose. For example, respect for older people exists in many societies and forms a basis for good social relationships. Another simple example is how people perform a handshake when they meet, which shows the level of politeness and respect for another person. Such gestures and behaviour standards should persist in society because they generally benefit humanity.\n\nHowever, certain traditions are not worth spending time or money on and do more harm than good. For example, one of the most burdensome customs in the world is Uzbek weddings, which are generally known for a large number of guests invited and overly expensive restaurants where they are held. Uzbeks work almost their entire lifetime to accumulate enough money to organize such weddings for their sons and daughters. These traditions bear little benefit for people, and the amount of time and dedication wasted on them could be spent on more valuable activities.\n\nIn a nutshell, every nation has custom social norms and traditions which form its identity.

I am convinced that this is a very intricate matter and need thorough investigations to determine which opinion is correct. \n\nPeople now live in a very advanced modern world, where we are accompanied by technology almost every step we take in our lives. Our infrastructure has become so advanced and sophisticated that we cannot function our daily lives without certain services provided for us.

Disastrous weather such as hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, In 2004, the Tsunami in Indonesia took away millions of lives, thousands of families have lost their members and homes, and it caused a long-lasting severe economic loss not only in East Asia but also to the world.  Although the affected area has received emergency aids from domestic and international societies, the reconstruction works are still enormous and it may take decades to recover. Other examples such as melting ice sheets in the north pole which is caused by global warming,  would lead to the rise in ocean level and there is really not much that humans could do to change it. Furthermore, Coastal areas would be flooded and many species would lose theirs inhabits.  In order to tackle this problem  which is technically impossible to be solved and governments would have to spend an unimaginable amount of money \n\nThe fact has proven it is hard to survive and live with the consequence when climate change comes; therefore, every possible action must be taken to protect our environment and to prevent any disasters from happening. On the one hand, individuals would make a contribution by using reusable bags and going to work by walking or public transportation to reduce contamination to the environment.

As children are young, they will observe and follow their parents at early stage and then will learn from their playmates and classmates in their early years.\n\nAt early stage, parents will be their primary soruce of contact and thus will guide them through basic life skills.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or  continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after  school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.  The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many  young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can  become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family.  In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue  their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real  experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead  to promotions and a successful career.  On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their  studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For  example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the  relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job  opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer  qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and  sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young  people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to  compete.

While some people argue that robots might have negative impacts on the future community, I believe that the benefits of the robot are likely to outweigh the negative aspects of it.\n\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why it could be argued that robots might have adverse effects on civilization in the future. Firstly, some people believe that robots will harm the human workforce. The people will be replaced by machines and this will increase the unemployment rate. As a result, many other problems may emerge, such as poverty and increased crimes. Secondly, people will become more dependent on robots in their daily life and this may harmfully affect their skills like cooking and driving. So people become less active and this may result in some health problems like obesity.\n\nOn the other hand, I would agree with those who argue that robots will play important positive roles in future society. The first role is that robots could operate in locations that humans cannot reach such as exploration of the outer space. They can act as extended eyes for humans, enabling them to look beyond their visual boundaries. Moreover, robots will be used inside human bodies for monitoring their health and undertake surgery. The second role that will be played by robots is the helping of elderly and retired people with their daily life activities like cooking and cleaning. Finally, robots could do normal jobs quickly, unlike human beings. Robots don not complain or get distracted or tired. They readily work twenty-four hours and require minimal maintenance.\n\nTo summarize, a robotic teacher does not have the necessary disciple to properly give instructions to students and actually works to retard the ability of a student to comprehend new lessons. Therefore, it is clear that the idea of running a classroom completely by a machine cannot be supported. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that the adverse effects of the debate over technology-driven teaching will always be greater than the positive effects, and because of this, classroom teachers will never be substituted for technology."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

While done people hold the view that learning about global issues at school would prove to be beneficial in the long run, others argue that it is a waste of time. According to my perspective, it is redundant for teenagers to study international bulletins. The upcoming essay tends to discuss why I believe so.\n\nUndoubtedly, it is indispensable for people to read articles as it widens their horizons. But students already have a lot on their plates so burdening them with real-world troubles is inequitable. Including worldwide news in academics would greatly reduce the time spent on more crucial subjects like mathematics, physics and biology. Consequently, scholars would have limited knowledge about these topics and would get poor academic scores. Due to the average results, it would be difficult for them to get admitted to a top university.\n\nAdditionally, bulletins comprise if diverse topics, such as politics, conflicts, natural catastrophes , etc. Some of these articles can be depressing and can have negative impacts on children's mental health. Children should always maintain a safe distance from politics but reading newspapers means getting exposed to them. On the other hand, stories of world conflicts can leave a long-lasting scar on their young souls. Similarly, some adolescents can find articles on environmental pollution heart-wrenching. For instance, a teenage girl from India committed suicide because she was upset about the rising levels of pollution and corruption. In her suicide note, she addressed  the PM to take necessary steps to curb down these issues.\n\nTo conclude, it is an indisputable fact that news enhances our knowledge about the world.

People claim that, celebrities are followed more for a fashion and money than their intelligence. This essay will argue, why young ones are impacted and how it creates a wrong influence on them.\nCelebrities have a great influence on the younger ones. Social media plays a vital role to make an ordinary individual turning into a famous personality over night helps to make them look extraordinary. No matter what, if the person lacks any talent, but exceptionally good at showing off money will get famous soon. For example, a rich person can post a video of riding of his/her latest Tesla car on Instagram and that video will be liked by millions of people around the world, that's how they get recognised. Overall, young generation is easily attracted to a materialistic world rather than admiring actual efforts.\nDespite celebrities being highly followed they leave a negative impact on the minds of young ones. Children try to imitate them in every sense, moreover, they desire to be one of them in a mere future, which directly impact their career in the initial stage of education. Also, they devote precious time on copying them instead of focusing on their studies. For instance, children try to maintain glamour by wearing same clothes and making videos to the perfection, which impacts their interest in homework. In short, young generation is easily bullied by the fake world without thinking the negative aspects.\nThis essay argued that younger individuals are mesmerized by the spark of famous personalities ignoring their hard work and talent.

Although there are good arguments in favour of studying at university or college, I personally believe that getting a job after school is worth encouraging.\n\nOn the one hand, there are various compelling reasons why people believe that after school, students should enter university or college where they could find a successful job out in the future. The reason is that an undergraduate degree or higher could help a new engineer or bachelor easier to take an application for a job. For example, a private company or state normally gives recruitment conditions to candidates who have to get a minimal degree of graduation in undergraduate. Consequently, several students flock to register in universities or colleges immediately after finishing school. In contrast, it is difficult to gain a good job for those not having to finish graduation from a university or college.\n\nOn the other hand, I would side with those who believe that students should gain work after school. The reason is that more and more people want to get a degree in engineering or a bachelor's while the rest of those looking for a job account for fewer numbers. For example, 80% of the total number of students get a degree of graduation and which means the left directly takes part in the production as workers. As a consequence, this causes the situation of several engineers to be greater than the number of workers. Therefore, if not enough people attend to producing directly would make the unbalance in the labourer force of a country.  \n\nIn conclusion, while there are some benefits of studying at university or college after school, I still agree with those who think that the best choice for students is to get a job straight after school."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Do you agree or disagree? Why?\nEssay: There has been a controversy about whether cities should have those large public spaces, such as parks and squares. I would say it's necessary, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs. \n\nFirst and foremost. Those large public spaces can propel the city's economic development. As we know, shopping malls are always located in the city centre; they represent the city's capacity to a large extent. Therefore, if there is a well-known shopping mall in a certain city, then the publicity of this city is bound to increase, and it will attract more tourists. As a result, this city can better develop. It's worth mentioning that shopping malls are extremely vital for some small cities or towns than megacities. Those big cities have already reached their bottlenecks, but for some small towns, it's a great opportunity to develop by building some shopping malls. \n\nSecond, it's a good chance to establish a particular culture in the city. Take New York as an example. NY is famous for its time square, which can represent more than a single square. For example, it can give tourists a feeling that NY is the center of the world at their first glance, on account of numerous billboards in time square and all the skyscrapers. In this case, a large public space can exert an influence on people's minds. \n\nThird, it's advantageous to our bodies. Due to the growth of the human population, more people tend to live in cities; in other words, the number of cars will increase. As we know, a park has a lot of plants, like trees and flowers.

Do you agree or disagree with the given statement?\nEssay: There has been some discussion about the existence and need of parks and squares in towns and cities. While some people believe that these open premises are essential, others insist that these places make the land useless and hence they must be converted to practical purposes. In my opinion, despite the voices against the larger public places, parks and squares provide great value to both the towns and its civilians.\n\nFirst of all, the open areas have always been considered as the heart of cities, where people get together for meetings and leisure activities. Besides that children and their parents spend quality time at these places after their hectic daily schedules. The increasing pollution in cities is a cause of great concern for the government and the citizens and places like parks and squares often provide relaxation to the old people. Moreover, such places attract tourists as they usually have a history behind their creation. For instance, all European towns are famous for their beautiful gardens and city center squares. Thus, it\u2019s absolutely imperative to conserve them for the future generations.\n\nOn the other hand, one can\u2019t deny the fact that cities are getting crowded each day and lacking places to build public and commercial centers. New transportation systems are coming to the cities and they need a large space to build stations and wider lanes. For example, New York was planned nearly two hundred years ago and the roads in the city were small and narrow which were built for carts not for cars and buses. Later, New York city authority converted many historical parks and gardens into parking stations and highways. This transformation was publicly criticized by civilians and other town planners. Therefore, destroying parks and other public places for current benefits is not the solution for space constraints in cities.\n\nIn conclusion, big public grounds are the need of our future generations. Cities are facing a lot of pressure to develop a substantial infrastructure for the growing population, but this cannot be allowed at the cost of parks and squares. Therefore, it\u2019s completely indispensable to have huge social places in the cities and towns."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

While I accept that social skills are significant factors those looking for jobs need to have, I would argue that their academic results are also necessary factors. \n\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that employer's good  social skills bring benefits to companies. It is because  most jobs require the spirit of teamwork. For example, if an employee has good skills such as listening, discussion and getting well with his colleagues, his job may get the success. Therefore, companies could earn more benefits and develop markets thanks to these efficient workers. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some reasons why employees also need to recruit those who have high academic qualifications. When a company hire workers, they expect that the worker may handle the work productively and bring  benefits for companies. A good example is that if mechanic companies hire workers with high levels of their profession, the production system may seldom have problems, or the problem may address quickly. Moreover, the more professional workers companies have, the more savings they have. To illustrate, one person who has deep and mastery in their jobs, they can work efficiently some tasks together.

Moreover, some buyers may attach importance to the sense of belonging in their future home, especially for new immigrants who landed in a foreign land.

From the start of the game, the thinking process of each player is stimulated to enhance the game to be more agile and to win a final. Not only can they feel responsible for each team member but also for a coach and all who cheers for the championship. Each person of the group knows his own role and put a lot of efforts into fulfilling the task. These kinds of roles and targets within a group, show children how to work jointly to reach the aim of a command. That, as well, can be projected to real life situations when they grow up and live in society. \n\nOn the other hand, some people claim that there is no such team sport in institutions that can bring up a man who would be able to cooperate.

To what extent do you agree?\nEssay: These days modern technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated. However, I disagree with those who feel that in the end all human workers will be replaced by robots.\n\nFirstly, the absence of human touch makes it highly unlikely that genuine and deep emotional understanding can be formed. Although AI systems can work faster and without a break, they can not evaluate emotions before making decisions. These systems always remain highly rational and practical, which, in turn, find it challenging to bring in emotions while interacting with human customers. To illustrate, when it comes to mental health consultation, it would be difficult for systems to see the real situation such as  the customer's body language, facial expression, and non-verbal cues. The fact that not all jobs can be performed by AI proves the importance of potential human workers cannot be overlooked. \n\nSecondly, replacing human workers with AI mostly can increase the risk of unemployment. Although it seems to have  great potential for technology development, it leads people to financial crises, which cause them difficulties to fulfil their basic needs such as  food, accommodation, and education. This reality could even be worse with the effect of the number of crimes due to the lack of job opportunities for workers. Even though the future is even more promising to have such a great potential technology, the opportunities still have to be balanced for AI and human workers. \n\nIn conclusion,  it seems to me that employing robots has a  substantial drawback, not only can not evaluate emotions but also increases the risk of unemployment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Therefore, learning approaches are a primary concern in any society. While some people claim students ought to interact with teachers through questions and arguments, others argue that this freedom can lead to disorganization in the classroom. I tend to agree with the former since individuals are different in all aspects and they have opposite ideas and regardless of any topic everybody has the right of expressing. \n\nOn the one hand, when pupils have an opportunity to enquire questions and debate different ideas they not only learn new aspects about a topic but also share thoughts with other people. Moreover, this change of ideas is a form of broadening their horizon for new perspectives. For instance, according to research published by Harvard University, in a discussion, when citizens know both sides of it, 75% tend to be more aware of outcomes. \n\nOn the other hand, some individuals believe teachers should have  control of the situation in order to maintain  respect. In order words, students should not have the opposite idea in relation to their supervisors. Furthermore, some adults argue pupils irrespective of any topic, pupils need to respect older ones. Take a survey carried out by The New York Times as an example where without discussions, supervisors are more respected, however, the creativity of supervised ones is reduced by 30%. The more control of people, the more limited society will be. \n\nAs far as I am concerned, I tend to agree with the former view since the limitation of knowledge become students in adults without a critical sense.

In my opinion, however, I disagree with doing nothing with the problem as I think if it's not prevented in the next few years, we won't  no longer be able to live on earth. \nFirstly, one of the main problems that concerns people about climate change is the general increase in the worldwide temperature. Most of the pollution produced by the massive use of cars as well as the industries is damaging the earth's upper layers such as the atmosphere, which prevent us from being hit by the sun's ultraviolet light.

In this essay, I will clarify both the merits and demerits of this movement for school leavers\u2019 education.\n\nTo begin with, the trend towards delaying further education is beneficial to high school graduates with their later studies. In particular, school leavers receive opportunities to explore their potential and life goals before attending any higher educational institutions. By doing part-time jobs and travelling to different regions domestically or abroad, the young can relax their mind, identify their interests, and find their inspirations for further study. This betters their decision-making in terms of choosing the right majors and future careers. If the young can not study their suitable academic field in college, they are likely to lose motivation and interest towards their education. Consequently, it prevents them from achieving better academic results. Moreover, gap years for individuals facilitate the graduates to learn practical skills which are necessary to their major. Many students find it incomprehensible knowledge taught at universities or colleges, which may affect their academic results. For this reason, if the young are exposed to real working environments where they can learn  several skills related to their desired educational field, they will find the knowledge gained in universities relevant and informative to their later career path. As a result, they can attain higher academic achievements.\n\nHowever, this trend also implicit several drawbacks to young people\u2019s academic learning. One of the disadvantages is break years are counter-productive for those who do not possess  great concentration, firm determination, and self-discipline as they can not make great use of the break and waste it for fruitless interests such as playing games or sleeping in, \u2026 A further point that can be taken into consideration is that some young learners can be so tempted by earning money or having a break that they discontinue their education. \n\nIn conclusion, although working or travelling before going to university might be ideal for young people thanks to its numerous benefits, they shouldn\u2019t overlook its hidden disadvantages."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

While I agree with the thought that it is beneficial to both students and the public, I believe that youngsters should not be obliged to do community service without being paid.\n\nOn the one hand, there are several benefits of giving young students the added responsibility of doing unpaid work. Firstly, by doing these works, teenagers can accumulate valuable experiences and essential skills for their future career. In addition, they will be given the opportunity to have better resumes, which is useful once they start pursuing higher education or seeking jobs. Finally, the public also benefits from this group of people as they help to finish the necessary work.\n\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the idea that serving the community without any financial incentive should be voluntary. One reason is that the amount of work that needs to be done at school is already enormous. Children nowadays are forced to attend several cram schools and extra classes, which, according to numerous parents, will help them to obtain better academic results. Another important factor is that youngsters need sometimes for themselves to develop their own interests, make some new friends or take up new sports.\n\nIn conclusion, although I accept that doing community service without payment is advantageous to both the society and students individually, I do not consider the idea that it should be made compulsory."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\nEssay: It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don\u2019t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today\u2019s society.

Whereas, in the present era, individual love to use machines for their daily routine works. It has lots of advantages but we cannot neglect the downsides of usage of technologies.\n\nOn the one hand, there are a plethora of advantages of using machines which can save a lot of time and perform better than humans. For example washing clothes manually consume too much, water and detergent. Therefore, people use a washing machine for wash bucket of clothes at one time and save their water and detergent also. Moreover, people use a kitchen appliance like blender, microwaves and refrigerator for cooking food and preserved it for a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some drawbacks of using technologies which can affect our health and fitness.

This happens due to a series of reasons and the consequences are both pros and cons. In my opinion, I lay my thought alongside the disadvantages.\nThere are two main reasons why having children late has been a trend for many modern couples. First, instead of embarking on the parenthood life, their career success is the top- priority. They believe that taking care of their off-springs would deter them from achievements and promotions in the early stage of life. Second, nowadays young couples want to have countless opportunities to enjoy life. For example, they could have more time to travel together, pursue their hobbies and interests or have richer social life with friends. \nThis tendency could lead to several severe problems. An important concern for family is that raising up children could be a huge challenge for older parents. Even though they have a strong socioeconomic status and finance potential, it might be difficult to communicate with theirs kids due to the generation gap. Moreover, having pregnant after 35 years old is relatively dangerous since both moms and their children would have more possibility health risks.

What are the effects on society?\nEssay: It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.\nThe main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.\nThis trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.\nIn summary, while science is regarded as a \"useless\" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

With the help of rapidly ameliorating technology, their desire to learn about history can be easily put into life. But what are the roots of such an eagerness?\n\nFirst of all, the hectic lifestyle that we all experience nowadays does not leave any space for calmness and peace in our souls, so most people- especially adolescence- are struggling with finding their feet, whilst having a broad spectrum of knowledge about the world around really gives a feeling of confidence in the impermanence of life.

In my opinion, I totally agree with the notion because it affects the build-up of early self-esteem in girls and restricts competitive spirit which affects the male child.\n\nTo begin with, the development of personal confidence in the female child happens at a much younger age in the presence of interacting with the opposite sex. Thus, this hinders them from acculturating into a new system when they graduate into tertiary education. For instance, a study conducted in 1993 by the Federal Ministry of Education revealed vividly that one of the key reasons for a low image worth in the female gender is the absence of interaction with their masculine age pair. Therefore, this imbalance has a negative impact on personal development.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the male gender has a much lower level of assimilation when they are younger. However, in a joint-sex school, they are able to balance this out as they compete to do better in assessments and examinations. For example, in a recent survey conducted by 25 teachers of an all-boys school, the majority attested to the fact that maximum motivation in boys can be achieved when both gender are placed in the same class for learning.\n\nTo conclude, in as much as we have more regions that have adopted to give parents the option to choose, teachers and school authorities still have a responsibility to be strict to curb indecent acts and inappropriate practices among students."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

One of the daunting issues is deforestation. In this day and age, as people have ever-growing demand for lands to live and woods to consume, they clear forest-based land for means of industrial, agriculture and residential purpose. It is a main contributor to habitat destruction and it pushes many kinds of species on the brink of extinction.

Thus, that many types of species are becoming extinct caused by human activities is the justification for people think it is too late to solve this trouble.\n\nWhile the severe effect on flora and fauna attribute to human actions are widely acknowledged, there are many resolutions to revamp this problem. It is crucial for authorities to contribute conservation area in order to creat wildlife habitat security for endangered animals.

A world of silent hybrids and electric cars has been ushered in by the automobile manufacturers as a result of this green environment movement. I believe the inefficiencies of yesterday\u2019s technology must be amended for the betterment of the future, and by this, I do not mean to suggest the end of the IC engines but rather their advancement. Wanting to be a part of this evolution, I entered this intriguing branch of engineering and enrolled in an undergraduate program in Automobile Engineering at PSG College of Technology. \n\nIn my freshman year, I enthusiastically involved with the Society of Automotive Engineers and attended several seminars and workshops. The seminar on Industry 4.0 familiarised me with the fundamentals of big data, cloud platform, and IoT. I also attended technical workshops on computational methods, autonomous driving, and ADAS technologies which gave me an insight into machine learning techniques, how they can be utilized to predict complex system behaviour, and to detect failure modes that would potentially degrade the vehicle performance at various aspects. This insight has been very valuable and has also kindled a deep interest in further gaining knowledge on the imminent automotive technologies.\n\nIn my sophomore year, I took to the practical aspects of the curriculum and worked in the SAE Pegasus team as a powertrain engineer, which is one among the finest and most recognized formula student teams in India. We participated in the national level event called Formula Student India held at Buddh International circuit in 2015. We secured the third place in skid pad and acceleration events, and overall we managed to finish among the top five teams. It taught us the different latitudes of approach in designing and manufacturing methods. It enhanced my knowledge of engine intake and exhaust dynamics as I was responsible for the design, analysis, and manufacturing of engine intake and exhaust systems. My design recommendations in the intake manifold runner and exhaust manifold, similar to the concept of a twin-scroll turbocharger, helped in improving the volumetric efficiency of the engine, thereby improving the vehicle acceleration. Mentoring juniors and working in the Pegasus team evolved me as a very good team player with good resilience. It helped me to understand the importance of project planning and time management. Moreover, I had an opportunity to acquire two weeks of in-plant training at Ashok Leyland, which gave me an understanding of the automotive product life cycle and the basic functioning characteristics of the vehicle sub-systems.\n\nIn addition to exploring the depth of engineering, I also expanded my horizons and interests through various extracurricular activities. I was an active volunteer at the National Service Scheme (NSS). While on my first NSS camps in one of the most remote places, I got an opportunity to teach basic mathematics and science to a group of 20 children aged between 12 and 16 years. Since then, I was a part of many more camps, and I thoroughly enjoyed serving the needy people. I discovered the organizational and leadership potential in me when I was an active member of the SAE student chapter under which we have organized numerous seminars and workshops. I was a member of the organizing committee for the renowned go-kart event - Schumi of tech, where I got to lead an energetic bunch of juniors. I volunteered in the FMSCI national level car rally championship, as a technical inspector for the world-class rally cars.\n\nIn the final year, I got an internship opportunity in the R&D sector of Jayem Automotives Pvt Ltd where I was given a challenging task to develop a real-time predictive 1-D Thermodynamic model for a 3 cylinder 800cc DICOR engine for the given engine configuration. Under the guidance of AVL, the thermodynamic cycle calculations were carried out using 1-D AVL Boost by implementing Wiebe combustion model factors and port flow coefficients from a similar benchmark engine to analyze the engine performance feasibility. Valve timing optimization and valve lift studies were done, and the pumping losses were reduced by advancing the exhaust valve opening. The exhaust residuals were reduced with an optimum valve overlap. Turbocharger matching and altitude feasibility studies were done to analyze the turbine and compressor efficiency at critical points and to avoid surge and choke conditions. The critical temperature and pressure limits were verified for the complete system at wide-open throttle condition. The low-end torque of the engine was reduced to examine the effect of air-fuel ratios in the lower operating speeds and the model was further calibrated to achieve a good correlation with the engine test bed data, thereby reducing the efforts taken for engine calibration and testing during various milestones. It had given me an exceptional exposure in engine thermodynamic modelling, simulation, calibration and testing methods.\n\nHaving proven my technical abilities and novel problem-solving skills during my internship, I was hired in the powertrain CAE department. I had acquired a comprehensive knowledge of leading-edge engineering principles, tools, and practices, with emphasis on designing, building, and validation of powertrain subsystems, by working with eminent organizations like AVL, BOSCH, TATA Motors, DRDO, Altair, Siemens, and Magna Steyr. My professional career commenced in one of the most challenging projects where an IC engine was developed for an aerospace application. I was introduced to the concepts of white, black and grey box modelling to evaluate the engine performance feasibility up to an altitude of 30,000 feet. Turbocharger selection and altitude derating studies were done for various aero grade fuels to evaluate the engine breathing capacity at high altitudes. The engine brake power required to produce essential thrust from the propeller at high altitudes was achieved with stringent limits on the BSFC. The fidelity of the model was further validated for higher altitudes with the test data from altitude chamber testing. \n\nOne of my works on the engine thermal management was presented at a national conference, ATCx 2018 event conducted by Altair engineering. A research on the cooling jacket optimization was done to evaluate the effect of peak temperatures in the low cycle fatigue regions of the engine head and block for the material AlSi7MgT6. Moreover, execution of In-cylinder flow and combustion analysis under the guidance of AVL in the development of 3 cylinder DICOR engine had given me a profound knowledge of the computational methods in thermal and fluid science. My involvement in the ICE projects has made me cognizant of the product life cycle of an engine from concept to homologation. Apart from the ICE, I researched the subject of battery thermal runaway for the high voltage (320 V) Li-ion battery pack deployed in TATA Nexon EV. To establish a robust cooling system, calorimeter tests, joule heating, and battery pack CFD studies were done to analyze the heat dissipation characteristics and predict the cell peak temperatures for various drive cycles. The battery performance and ohmic and polarization curves were determined using HIL battery testing. Furthermore, I developed valve control strategies using MATLAB/Simulink to maintain optimum cell temperature during charging and discharging at all ambient conditions and SOC and for various drive cycles.\n\nTo improve my technical competence and gain expertise in world-class automotive technologies, I stepped into the next phase of my career by securing a prominent role at one of the leading alliance automotive companies in the world, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Emerging as a powertrain system simulation engineer in a team that comprises of technical scholars working on cutting edge projects, proves the level of my technical abilities and also substantiates the fact that my academic grades do not reflect on my true potential. My responsibilities include hydraulic and thermo hydraulic system simulation of vehicle cooling system for ICE, BEV, HEV, and PHEV platform vehicles under EURO 6D and EURO7 norms globally. I have accomplished a challenging task of developing e-pump and valve control strategies in the cooling circuit for cold and hot phase operations for the Indian version of the BS6 HR10DET engine and CMF EV vehicle. I am currently engaged in the design of cooling system architecture for the next generation CMF EV followed by energy conservation studies like heat recovery methods for battery warm-up and the Rankine cycle reheating method for generating electric power in HEV and PHEV. In addition to the expertise gained over the years, cross-functional interaction with the global technical teams of Renault and Nissan have made a huge impact on my technical and interpersonal skills. \n\nHaving acquired profound knowledge in the field of powertrain, I want to further explore the depths of the field and the Master of Science in Automotive Engineering at Clemson University, with its stimulating research environment will equip me for such a feat. After graduating, I wish to pursue a research-oriented career in one of the leading automotive companies, devising solutions to overcome the challenges in the evolution of IC engines with stringent regulations. Dr. Zoran Filipi\u2019s tremendous contribution in the field of advanced IC engine concepts aligns with my interest of pursuing interdisciplinary research in the field of IC engine advanced combustion methods and control strategies followed by energy conservation methods to improve IC engine technologies for a clean and sustainable future. Hence, I aim to utilize my skill set to contribute significantly in the powertrain domain and become an expert by gaining a stellar career in the field of sustainable powertrain technology."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

I partially agree  with the given statement, and I will provide the substantiate argument in upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it another way, government should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses.  Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the issue of even distribution of  homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore,  are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes  to bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example,  the Canadian government restrict the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the issue of housing shortage.  On a contrary, people could also solve this issue by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer  living in villages and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. People can find more job  opportunities like farming in villages to earn a livelihood. This would help in bringing more  employment in the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages.

Yes, it is true that these artificial creatures can do a lot of things. But, someone needs to program with correct instruction in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decision because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence.

As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors which need social skills.\n\nNonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour work do not need much of brain power. Those work only needs to repeat some actions. Hence, those types of work will be done by robots in the future.

In my opinion, despite having a few negative impacts on our environment, I think that  economic growth is an inevitable factor for ending the food crisis and poverty.\n\nTo begin with, the economic indicators of a nation improve with the development of the financial condition of a country. In other words, since employment generation, an increase of purchasing power, and the rise of disposable income of citizens are improved, people can spend more money in purchasing foodstuffs, and they can similarly save money for future use. For example, Even though Bangladesh faced famine and economic crisis several time  earlier, nowadays people have sufficient crops and grains with the improvement of the economy. Thus, improvements in financial indicators help to remove the impoverishment and food shortage among the people.\n\nOn the other hand, the surroundings and biodiversity of an area may be negatively influenced by the development of the economy. Water, soil, and air can be polluted severely from the industrial emissions and throwing of toxic substances as more and more industries need to be established for  economic expansion. For instance, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has recently been recognized as one of the top contaminated city in the world with the advancement of its economy. Therefore, environmental issues of a country may be often required to be compromised in order to ensure the growth of the economy. \n\nIn conclusion, it is a debatable issue whether people should emphasise  economic progress, or  should protect the environment.

While some people do believe that eventually all jobs will be performed by robots and others believe the right time has not arrived yet. In my opinion, jobs which put human life in danger should help of automation.\n\nTo begin with, science has always made things easier for modern civilization. Moreover, certain tasks do require a degree of perfection as well as accuracy which is better than the human efforts. Robots are a means of long-term investment by big corporates to reduce the labour cost along with incidents such as union strike. For example, financial data of the top 30 companies in Japan shows a significant improvement in financials with the handling of robots. Hence, it is evident that use mechanization is for the better of society.\n\nIn addition, certain work environments have a higher rate of injuries which puts the employee's life in danger. Furthermore, safety together with efficiency has improved drastically with the use of automation. For instance, a survey suggests that work injuries are reduced by 60% in environments where artificial intelligence is used. Consequently, machines can be used to save time and avoid injuries.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that automation will soon replace all the major jobs.

It is often argued by a substantial proportion of individuals argued that AI is extremely essential for humans. However, others opine that the invention of automation has a negative impact on the community. This essay will discuss both views as far as I am in favour of the latter notion.\n\nTo commence with, several industries are making their own self-working humanoid robots because machinery can effortlessly do hard work without any problem. Videlicet, Artificial Intelligence is many huge companies already make their own machines such as Amazon, Google and Meta. Therefore, they are firing many employees from the brand.  For example, more than two-fifths of numerous manufacturers are using mechanical personnel because it consumed less time and does effective work in their field. Thus, Bionic humans have many advantages.\n\nIn addition, the fact cannot be denied that computerized people have several disadvantages as well.

This priority shift not only help them focus and earn huge amount of money to make them self sufficient, but it also helps to financially support the future generation in a better way. For instance, financially independent parents are able to provide a better lifestyle for their children than those who are unstable in their careers.\n\nOn the contrary, ageing brings vulnerability of severe health issues in a person's life. By the same token, pregnancy becomes complicated at the later stage, both for a man and a woman. A recent research concluded that, the probability of conceiving in couples is reduced by 23% after they touch their thirties and can further be declined up to 53% over the age of thirty five.

However, there are predominantly two contrasting views where a section of society vehemently deems that education for young children should be given more importance while others emphasise  adults\u2019 education. I partially agree with the given statement. In this essay, I will describe why the government should concentrate equally on children as well as adults\u2019 education.\n\n On the one hand, younglings are the future of any nation and they need proper education. Many children are unable to get basic education due to a lack of money. Additionally, many countries do not have good infrastructure and quality teachers therefore government are utilising their funds on expanding these facilities. As a result, more children can get a better education because country success is determined by quality education. For instance, in India there is an RTE act in those 6 to 14 years children education is free consequently maximum students are getting admission in schools.\n\nOn the other hand, adult literacy is also crucial because they are also responsible for social betterment in many ways. Firstly, Illiteracy leads to unemployment and crime. If people are not educated, they do not get jobs that will increase, different kinds of crime which will affect social peace. Government should provide different kinds of vocational training and life skills courses. For instance, many companies can hire adults that will be beneficial for the company as well as individual both. So adult education is fruitful for a person, society and nation altogether.\n\nIn conclusion, education is a pillar of any successful country.

Having machines replace humans has both positive and negative aspects, we will discuss these in detail.\n\nThe main advantage of using robots to perform a task is its performance and accuracy. A robot can outdo a human in terms of perfection and quality. For example, the aviation industry has zero-tolerance for errors, and so they prefer automation to manual labour. Another important advantage of employing a robot is increased productivity. A robot never takes a vacation nor it requires a break, they can perform their duty round the clock. To illustrate, manufacturing industries can utilize an industrial robot to perform repetitive tasks. \n\nAlthough there are positive sides to using robots to perform jobs, there are equally negative sides present for the same. One of the main disadvantages of using robots is their high maintenance cost. For instance, machines tend to wear and tear, run into technical glitches it is often required to maintain and upgrade. Another negative aspect of replacing humans with robots is joblessness. In this age, when the population is growing at a rapid phase the need for a job opportunity is scarce.

I completely agree with this notion. My position is justified further with reasons and examples.\n\nTo begin ,with there is no doubt that life is not easy as compared in the past nowadays.

While many people would argue that town life could be improved only by this action, I contend that this method is distrustful.\n\nFirst of all, there are myriad negative outcomes which are associated with the notion that create new buildings is much better than renovate existing ones, to expound, if authorities build new construction, it will be much expensive than renovate old building. For instance, in 2017 Astana city hall spent approximately 700 millions dollars to make new cinema, however, renovating past cinema park had been costed only 70 millions.

While some persons argue that government have to cater for the needs of its citizens, others believe that the public should plan their retirement. This essay will discuss both views in detail followed by a reasoned conclusion. \n\nOne of the reasons why people demand support from those in power at old age can be seen as a fundamental human right. Therefore every leader in every society has the duty to provide aid for the aged and dependent. For example, the military and civil servants gave their all during years of active service to the good of the country and it is morally justified for politicians to reciprocate by aiding the elderly. To further illustrate, some old people have challenging ailments which can only be overcome through free health care services by the government. For instance, via National Health Insurance Scheme, Nigerians are now able to seek quality health care which has improved the average life expectancy in the last decade.\n\nEven though authorities are playing a key role, individuals need to support themselves too. Firstly, being able to save for the future reduces the national burden . This is because more money is then diverted to other lacking sectors of the economy including good roads and electricity. For example, a recent study has shown that the amount incurred by African countries in delivering free medical backing to their citizens is over 30% of the national budget leading to scarcity of funds in other sectors. Hence  gross underdeveloped was achieved. Lastly, it is important for humans to save in other to support their children too. Thus helping in the long run at securing a bright future for them as they are able to afford decent school and training thereby impacting  society positively.\n\nIn conclusion, although controversy still exists on whether the government or public should cater for their old age ,however I am of the opinion that both have a concerted effort at achieving optimal care after retirement."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

While technological advancements have undeniably transformed various industries, leading to increased automation, it is crucial to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a scenario.\n\nOn the positive side, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in the workforce has the potential to enhance efficiency and productivity. For example, Tasks that are routine and repetitive could be delegated to machines, allowing human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their jobs.

Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge.

Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.\n\nOther individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak.

An argument is made that increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles will overcome the environmental problems. I completely disagree with this statement. This essay will discuss the idea and will justify my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles will indirectly increase the product prices. In other words, the products which are transported from different parts of the world will increase the purchase cost because of the fuel charges increased to deliver the product. This might reduce the demand for the product and there will be an uneven change in supply. For example, as the petrol and diesel price increases the prices of vegetable, dairy products, and online delivery charges are increased. Therefore in this was increasing fuel prices will indirectly increase the prices for daily needed products.\n\nAnother reason why fuel prices should not be increased is, the cost of travel may become expensive. The cost of aeroplanes, trains, buses, cabs, and any other transport service will be on a higher side. This will indirectly affect the tourism sector, as many countries like the Maldives, Switzerland are highly dependent on tourism so the revenue generated from tourists will reduce and the resource becomes limited. Moreover, inter-country travel will also see a reduction in passengers travelling.\n\nTo sum up, increasing the petrol and diesel prices will help to control environmental problems up to some extent, but on the other side, it will increase the product purchase cost and revenue generated through tourism will reduce."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Moreover, it is crucial for children to accept loss,furthermore understand that not everything goes always as planned and the world can be cruel.\n\nSecondly, sometimes in a team throughout teamwork you are able to reach results that would not have been reachable on your own. For example, I find way more satisfying achieving something with my friends than on my own, such as taking a good grade in a group work.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that you can learn lots of things not only from books or educational activities but also from other people and life experiences, such as going on a trip abroad or take part in a team sport."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<4"}]}

While this trend may be disadvantageous to certain extents, I believe its merits may outweigh its demerits. \n\nOn the one hand, certain advertising platforms often provide false information to viewers in order to raise their profits. To specify, these advertisements usually show exaggerated messages to the consumers and they do not mind serious repercussions behind this action. This would have a detrimental effect on people\u2019s mentality and make them feel confused or worried about the information. Advertising websites on the internet perfectly exemplifies this situation. Many platforms selling medication sometimes exaggerate the consequences after getting covid-19 disease. Their main purpose is to entice the consumers into buying their medicine so that they would gain a huge amount of money through this type of advertisement. Therefore, because of the increasing number of toxic commercial advertisements, many viewers might be affected negatively by buying unnecessary things.\n\nOn the other hand, many advertising programs would have a positive impact on human\u2019s life. Firstly, it might bring an opportunity to customers to get access to useful products and advertise them about the promotions of goods. This would bring convenience, which would make the consumers find it easy to purchase appropriate products. In addition, instead of buying products with original value, many advertisements might show numerous sales promotions so that customers could purchase these goods at an affordable price. For example, shopee, which is the name of a shopping online application, always advertise their products based on customer\u2019s interest and provide promotional codes for these products. Consequently, this would reduce the time that the consumers have to find suitable products as well as saving a huge amount of money for them. \n\nIn conclusion, while there still are many advertising programs that have a detrimental effect on people\u2019s lives, its negative impact still can not overshadow its positive impact."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

While some people believe that attending school is a waste of time, I agree with those who argue that there are valid reasons for all the subjects taught in educational institutions.\n\nGranted, it is easy to understand why some young people are disappointed with the results of their education, especially those who have a pragmatic approach and expect immediate rewards from everything they do. Some businesses exist where theoretical competence is overshadowed by empirical knowledge. Let's imagine a hypothetical situation where two candidates compete for the position of either a car dealer or a real estate agent. If one of the applicants is a recent graduate from college and the other is an experienced salesperson without a degree, the former has less chance of winning.\n\nHowever, I choose to support those who believe that every course is worth learning and that it is only a matter of time before knowledge shines through. Living in an era of rapid change, few people can predict the future direction of the market. This means that anything we learn may not benefit us now but will be useful for our future careers. In the future world, what will be required are not just skilled workers, but individuals with multiple talents who can utilize various forms of knowledge and adapt to different roles. In contrast, utilitarians who ignore the importance of learning will be considered short-sighted and will inevitably be left behind by the new wave of business. The success of the famous film director, Woody Allen, serves as a convincing example. If it weren't for the seemingly useless knowledge of history, literature, music, and art that he had accumulated throughout his life, it would be impossible for him to tell so many wonderful stories in movies.\n\nIn conclusion, academic education may seem like a waste of time to those who are short-sighted.

While some still hold to the Conservative view that certain jobs are better performed by men and others by women, it is my personal belief that people of their sex are capable of doing any job effectively. The reasons for my position are as follows.\n\nFirst of all, I believe it is mistaken to base our views on broad generalisations about the characteristics of men and women as such stereotypes are often inaccurate. Although there are certain traits which are typical of men and others which are typical of women, there are exceptions to every rule. Not all women are physically weak, just as not all men are poor interpersonal communicators; conventional gender roles are not appropriate for everybody. If a man or woman desires to pursue a career which is traditionally reserved for the opposite sex, I believe they should be provided with the opportunity to prove themselves capable.\n\nSecondly, I would contend that the presence of both males and females in a workplace brings a sense of balance. Men and women frequently, though by no means always, have different methods of doing things. Rather than judging these differences to be weaknesses, I feel that we should view them as opportunities for innovation and the discovery of more effective and efficient work practices.

The main reason for believing is that it will reduce pollution and environmental footprint that is a contributing cause to climate damage or destruction. It is also possible to say that consuming natural resources could be an alternative such as renewable energy. One good illustration of this is that the developing countries such as Canada reduce air pollution by implementing a policy raising the fuel cost for their nationals and it proved to be advantageous a recent study indicated that co2 was reduced by 60% last year owing to that strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, others argue that this will not help out to eliminate the risk of environmental destruction we need to consider other approaches such as environmentally friendly vehicles owing to save the planet. in addition to that, it is often argued that the government and automobile industry should be considered the green products or plantation of million trees project.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Cooperation is a crucial social skill that children must develop early on. I wholeheartedly support the idea that school team sports are one of the best ways to instil this quality in children. Participating in team sports nurtures values like teamwork, communication, and empathy, which are essential for healthy social interactions and character development.\n\nFirst, in team sports, players must collaborate to achieve common goals, which teaches children the importance of working together for success. This foundation of cooperation extends beyond the sports field into other aspects of life. For instance, you cannot be a champion in soccer if you do not have  good teamwork and collaboration, because you cannot hit a score alone. \n\nSecond, Effective communication is vital in team sports for coordinating actions and making quick decisions. Children learn to listen, share ideas, and support their teammates, improving their interpersonal skills in other group settings. Take a volleyball as an example, where each player has a role and they must communicate clearly to score. \n\nTeam sports expose children to both victory and defeat as a group, fostering empathy, camaraderie, and mutual respect. These values help children manage conflicts empathetically and maintain positive relationships. Most importantly, from experiencing winning or losing, the kid might understand what the process is. So they did not take everything for granted. \n\nIn conclusion, school team sports offer an excellent platform for teaching children cooperation, nurturing teamwork, communication, and empathy.

Some people constitute that a well-thought-out plan is the main reason, while others consider other elements such as diligence or good fortune are more important. This essay will discuss both perspectives and reasons why I believe that successful achievement results from several factors.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no doubt that planning skill is a crucial element in one\u2019s success. Firstly, going through a planned path allows people to achieve goals more effectively. This is because it is easier to attain singular aims by following specific steps.

Another element is having a good fortune to develop. For instance, a lot of people started to store face masks since not many people were aware of Covid-19.

However, I believe that wild animals deserve more resources to be safe from detrentally impact from individuals. There are several reasons supporting this viewpoint which could be discussed objectively during the course of this essay.\n\nTo begin with, many species almost extinct because of illegal activities which are made by  human. People hunt a huge number of animals to collect meat and skin to solve their hungry stomachs and sell them to receive money. However, each type of animal is the food for bigger predators, if a species is removed from the Earth, it will change the food chain in the natural cycle. For example, the grasshopper is eaten by the pigeon, however, with the spread of pesticides, the grasshopper is dead leading to the famine of the pigeon. \n\nSecondly, with the development of the industrial revolution and population explosion, wild aminals lose their habitats and natural environment. With the expanse of the human, forests and mountains are replaced by industries and accommodation to adapt to the demand of individuals. Thus, the number of animals reduces in order to expand human habitat. For instance, about 10% of forests in Vietnam were repurposed to become infrastructure for inhabitants.\n\nIn conclusion, for several reasons such as being victims of illegal activities and the industrial revolution, wild animals and birds face up to many risks, so both the authorities and individuals should have the responsibility to protect them from extinction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.0"}]}

Some people believe that increasing fuel prices can solve the problems by decreasing the amount of usage. In my opinion, this method indeed can make people use fewer fossil products to some extent while the best way to solve this problem is to teach people the consequences of using too many fossil products.\n\nIn recent years, more and more vehicles have emerged on the road, causing severe air pollution around the world. Although many countries have levelled up the price of fuel, this trend didn't disappear. Specifically, sometimes when the price of fuel was super high, it could control the usage of fuel immediately. However, it is impossible for governments to maintain high prices for a long time. Once the price started to decline, people tended to drive their own cars again. Therefore, the price of fuels influenced human activities in the short term but it was extremely hard to change the human habit over a long period.\n\nTo decrease the amount of fossil used by humans forever, the best way is to teach people that if we emit too much carbon dioxide into the earth,  will turn out? It is undeniable that this method is tremendously difficult for governments to apply but if we can succeed, this can change human habits. For example, if people have learned  new knowledge, they will take more public transport.

I personally concur that working teens may have positive impacts on society and teens themselves, I do not agree with those who think it has to be an obligation.\n\nTeenagers can benefit from a number of advantages while working in their spare time. To start with, having a job has a great role in developing a sense of responsibility. Work make a circumstance where one can see the consequences of their actions more frequently and vividly. In addition to that, having an occupation since adolescence is a significant way to improve self-esteem and self-confidence. Moreover, by being able to work as a teen, one can make a stronger resume which will come handy in their future effort for hunting jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, working adolescents are also of use for the community. One of the most prominent uses is as work labour. Employers who offer low-paid jobs and part-time positions which do not interest ordinary adults, can benefit from this cheaper workforce. For example, jobs like cashier and delivering packages which naturally do not have high wages and great scope of prosperity, usually are done by part-timers who are mostly teenagers. \n\nHaving said that, obligatory work for anyone including teens is not just. The right to choose to have a job or not is a fundamental human right and no one should waver that. More importantly, nowadays child labour is a prominent issue in some nations.

When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth.

This question opens a big debate. On the one hand, there are some museums that require an admission fee to be paid. On the other hand, there are free-entry museums. I believe that if the charge to be paid is not expensive then it is right and fair to require an admission payment to visit a culutural place.\nIn general, we used to believe that free is always better. However, I believe it is not a waste of money if they are spent to increase your knowledge. In Italy, for instance, museums and cultural places, in general, do not receive the economical support they need from the administrative centres. This phenomenon implies the following choice: either museums have to ask people to pay an entry fee or they have to stop taking care of the building and the artistic works they host. Then, I believe that to pay an admission fee is a way people, who are interested in art and in culture in general, can demonstrate their taking care of the place in which art is preserved.\nWhat should be the negative consequence of asking for an entry fee? In general, we believe that the money we spend is wasted. Although we spend them to obtain something we appreciate a lot, we always have the tendency to think that money should not be used and preserved. I cannot disagree with this way of thinking. However, I believe that spending money to pay a trisfling amount of money to get access to a cultural place is not a waste. Rather, it is a sort of investment for your personal culture and for the cultural building itself. What's more, generally, if people have to spend money to do any activity they used to enjoy as they can. As good materialists, we want to live the experience to respect the money spent. Then, paying an entry fee will encourage people who care about art to visit a museum rather than those who do not care. Art maybe is made less accessible but, in my opinion, will be more respected. The entry fee should not be (and in general is not) expensive. I cannot see why it should be seen as a loss of money to pay the entry fee of 5 euros to go inside the Louvre in Paris, the estraordinary Valle dei Templi in Sicily, or the magnificent Uffizi gallery in Florence.

It is widely said that teens should devote their free pace to social work which will be benefited for both of them. I completely agree with this notion which I will elucidate in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, people are more vulnerable to many diseases & hence they need special assistance. Hospitals nowadays, are not only meant for treatment but a place for generating revenue by making fools. Therefore, if most of these diseases should be treated at the home then it will save a lot of money. In doing so, the youngesters of that humanity can also start helping to those patients in their leisure hour. While doing so, it will reflect the culture & values of their families.

I think people do that because they have the cognitive to protect the historical value of the buildings and the sense of connection that people felt within the exploration. In order to research their history, people can gather the knowledge and memories that elder citizens around them have and go to the libraries in their cities.\n\nMany buildings with great historical value had been destroyed because of the wars and people's ignorance in the past. Therefore, many people appeal for the protection of buildings. After people have the cognitive to appreciate the  beauty of historical buildings, people willing to find out the history of the buildings in their own living places. What's more, the process of exploring the stories about the buildings in their cities enhances the connection between them. Because the forms of architecture are special due to the unique elements a location has, such as weather and culture, these link everyone who lives there and make them feel united.\n\nIn order to know the history of the building where they live, one of my suggestions is to ask the elders who also live there. Because they have more experiences since the more time they have lived, they might have experienced the changes of the time of these architectures. Another suggestion is going to local libraries and searching for the information which had been recorded on paper.\n\nIn conclusion, people's increasing interest in excavating the history of  architecture in the place they live is due to their cognitive of protection after the destruction of many buildings and the sense of connection that is given to explorers.

In my opinion, I partially agree with this opinion because not only encouraging people to have healthy lifestyles  but also the treatment of patients is important equally. \n\nTo begin with, These days, the number of illnesses increasing  such as obesity, diabetes, stroke and many more, Furthermore, it has become a serious problem in our society.

Moreover, It will eventually be able to reduce numerous illnesses in  modern society.\n\nHowever, It is also significant to treat people who are already sick. This is because patients deserve to get treatments properly from the government. Actually, whether people are ill or not, everyone pays taxes to the government regularly. So, patients have to get health care from the country and the authorities have to spend public money in an appropriate way. This means they must expend public money on the treatment of people who are already ill including preventing disease.   \n\nTo sum up, although hindering illness is largely essential because it can reduce a substantial amount of disease in  society, treatment of patients also is equally crucial since they have proper health-care rights."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: These days, environmental issues have received a lot of attention from the public. While some people believe that citizens should be looking for solutions to live with climate change rather than mitigate it, I partly agree with this argument.\n\nOn the one hand, encouraging preventative measures to deal with climate change has a large role to play in today's world for many reasons. Firstly, because of the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, people's health is being adversely affected, leading to the fact that medical services are gradually becoming burdened with patients having respiratory diseases. If prevention is not continuously taken into consideration in the long run, global communities may face the threat of lacking health care systems for regional medical demands. Secondly, governments have allocated fundings to get to grips with the issue for decades; therefore, their endeavours in preserving the planet would be pointless if this would not continue to happen.\n\nOn the other hand, despite the aforementioned reasons for which climate change should be fought against, it is no doubt that people have spent millions of dollars on reversing the catastrophic effects of it. Some obvious successes are recently reported, such as the ozone layers have been covered. Be that as it may, there is nothing to stop the pollutants from factories and human activities. For example, according to recent statistic reports, pollution levels are increasing at a deteriorating rate, which can be seen as blurry fogs in some countries, such as China or Vietnam. This, as a result, would not only require further fundings from organizations to build filtering equipment for local residents, but also urge them to pay more taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are different opinions about whether we should be complacent about the current environmental issues or eliminate them, I believe that we should both learn how to protect ourselves from the harmful gases released into the atmosphere and set up long-term schemes for future improvements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In this modern world, it is argued by some politicians and authorities that climate change has been occurring for many years that is the reason why the governments should provide a solution to live in a way rather than some precautions. I partially agree with that statement and I believe that while people adapt to living with climate change and global warming, countries have to show their effort as much as possible to decrease the increasing trend of temperature.\nFirst of all, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, hazardous gases and wastewaters have been released by factories to nature. Moreover, it firstly has been caused global warming, then climate change. This harmful situation affected not only human beings but also all the species around the world. To save wildlife and diversity of species, governments should publish a law to ensure the nature will be protected. For instance, if biodiversity changes, all the food production and people\u2019s nutritional behaviour will change too. Furthermore, oceans and inner sea's temperature have increased by years. For instance, while a person who lives in Greenland was not able to swim in the 1970s due to icebergs, now Greenland has become a tourist destination with its beaches. How do not people protest climate changes after witnessing that undesirable situation?\nOn the other hand, whereas governments and individuals have been showing their effort to save the environment, it is clearly seen that the average temperature of the world has been increasing constantly. Additionally, almost all countries spend a huge amount of money every year in order to protect nature. In contrast, if they invest in the health care system, infrastructures of big cities and most importantly, innovation of agriculture, it would be more beneficial not only for governments financially but also for citizens. Furthermore, as per an academic article published by the World Bank says that whereas the total budget of the countries which fight to prevent climate changes is 450 Billion USD, the effect of the human factor is only 5% to prevent increasing heat.\nIn conclusion, in the light of information given above, climate change is an undeniable fact. Every human being will face this critical issue. Personally, I think that the governments and individuals should not stop their efforts, but at the same time, peoples have to be aware that this problem will never be fixed and that is the reason why everyone has to find a way to live with this reality."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

Why is this the case? Which development do you think is better?\nEssay: In a few cities, bikes are given priority over cars, while in others pedal rides are being replaced by car drives. This essay will discuss why this is the case, followed by my opinion. \n\nMany people choose to use an automobile over a pedal because they think cycling is less time-consuming and more comfortable. However, pedals are only useful for short distances and they are not air-conditioned, so the public will be uncomfortable in cold or hot weather, plus the pedal takes physical effort to pedal, which makes the public feel very tired. For instance, in Baotou, a small city in China, commuters tend to choose vehicles as their transportation as it takes an average of one hour to get to work by pedal compared to just 30 minutes by car.\n\nNevertheless, many metropolitan areas encourage their citizens to travel by pedal rather than a vehicle, as cycling can bring many benefits to the city and the public. Cycling involves pedalling, which activates your body and keeps your heart strong. On top of this, it does not produce any kind of pollution in the environment and does not add to traffic. Moreover, since parking spaces are very limited and the cost of parking is extremely high in a metropolis, trying to use bicycles instead of cars is more cost-saving for many people. These benefits are highly needed to improve both lifestyle and the environment under global warming conditions. For example, in Amsterdam, the government has given top priority to bike riders and created separate bike lanes to promote the idea. Today, the majority of the city's population only rides bicycles.\n\nIn conclusion, taking into account the above facts and the health benefits of cycling, I believe that this development is far better and should be adopted by all places around the world."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

In my opinion, this phenomenon is a positive one because it enlightens people with happenings around and the glob and at the same time educates the public with authentic information and opportunities.\n\nFirstly, newspaper is a medium through which people can get acquainted with adequate knowledge of what goes around. Similar to televion, radio, and the internet, newspaper is another effective media platform that carries informative news about current happenings in local and internationa scene, which can broaden readers' visions and open their minds.

Different from all kinds of posts, videos, and advertisements that pop up on the screen, information from newspapers are more authentic and appropriate since they can be sourced from a specific writer from. It is unneccessary to worry about children being misdirected by inappropriate content or elders being deceived by fake posts from newspapers since the authorized publishers are more trustworthy.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nEssay: In the modern era, the masses are frequently using social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube to contact other folks and to keep themselves updated about current affairs around the world. I believe the pros of this phenomenon will outbalance the cons, as we will see in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, the tendency of making use of social media these days has many advantages for people dwelling on different continents. With aid of these online websites and ,applications one can confabulate with their loved ones residing in some corner of this gigantic world. Now, the public can stay in touch with their families and friends with the snap of their fingers. This idea has lessened the communication barriers and was considered a dream of the past which has now become a stark reality owing to the advancement in science and technology. For instance, people living in an underdeveloped country in Africa like Kenya can talk to their peers living in Canada in North America. Moreover, people who are curious about the current happenings around the globe can get to know news with the effective use of data and information available on the internet. This enhances their knowledge and intellectual development. Likewise, this can also help them to adapt to the fastly transforming world. Hence, social media proves to be beneficial for folks.\n\nOn the contrary, along with a plethora of vantages, social media has notable disadvantages as well. One of the most considerable negative aspects is that it engenders feelings of jealousy and envy among people. For example, when folks who are not affluent view their peers and colleagues as living in the lap of luxuries, they tend to develop negative sentiments such as resentment and hatred which are detrimental to their mental health. Furthermore, social media is tremendously corrupting day-to-day human interactions by reducing the number of physical interactions in the everyday lives of the masses. Nowadays, people are more inclined to interact with other people using mobile applications and online websites rather than visiting in person as they used to do in the past. This transmutation in social demeanour has negative implications on the traditions and customs of a particular culture. One can see this with the crowd losing their stranglehold on the ethics and values of society. Therefore, the use of social media possesses considerable and noteworthy cons for folks.\n\nTo conclude, the usage of the internet has become heavily popular since the dawn of the twenty-first century. The internet is being utilised by the public to check on other folks or to enlighten themselves about news events.

That is to say, if students do not admire and honour their monitor,they will not be able to learn any subject by them. For example, learners  in upper grades can not learn math,science and artificial intteligience at school if the teacher does not have class-mangement or he/she can not make students listen or follow up with the lesson. Thus, accepting rude comments  will lead to out-of-control tutition as well as desortation of respectable image of teacher. \n\nOn the other hand, evaluting teachers could be one aspect of teaching ,yet it should be taken as a holistic evaluation containg parts such as: parents,administration and students.Moreover,this evalution should be conducted professionally and without any bias criterian .The most impotant point is to deal with criticisim as a factor to motivalte teacher not  as a mean of offense  and humilitation.

While some are in support of this statement, others oppose it. However, I personally agree with the concept. The coming paragraphs will shed a light on my point of view.\n\nTo commence with the first notion, dealing with the folks improves their communication and social skills which eventually intensifies their prospect of getting employment in a reputed organisation. For example, there was a 'Dreamhack Gaming Event' held in my vicinity a couple of months ago in which one of my known youngsters worked as a volunteer. On the basis of it, he had been given a chance to work with one of a big multinational company, at a delightful package as soon as he had completed his schooling. Besides he was also permitted to continue his further studies while working.\n\nIn addition, since we live in a society so it is our duty to take care of it as a family. Furthermore, having  cost-free work from agile guys is a pleasure for mankind. In other words, it gives quite a good aid in improving public health, as well as, since it is a social service, they don't have to pay any charge for it, leading to the reduction of economic burden. For instance, there was a 'Clean India Mission' held in our country a few years back in which youngsters played a vital role in cleaning the streets and roads for pedestrians. It helped to prevent several fatal diseases like Asthma and Dengue, etc. \n\nIn conclusion, although it is a without pay service by the teenagers, yet it is apparently fruitful for them as well as for the citizens. Therefore, viewing the need of the hour and loads of benefits, I again would like to recommend that it should be encouraged in our community."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Critics argue that teenagers should be mandated to volunteer during their leisure time, which will benefit both the individual and society. The essay will provide a stance on the following statement alongside several reasons. \n\nThe purpose of non-profitable organisations is to help the vulnerable and their local community by offering any kind of assistance and resources when needed. Their operation does not make any sort of monetary profit and the workforce consists of volunteers who spend a few hours per week helping out. Implementing such policies will alleviate manpower issues in NGO sectors and help allocate resources efficiently as well as cover a wide range of demographics located in remote or isolated places. \n\nAs a volunteer, you will gain first-hand experiences and skills that can be transferable to your daily life, such as academics,professional and personal life.

The nature of this work serves as an opportunity to give back to the community.

People are suggested that the policymaker should higher the price for fossil fuel used in private vehicles in hopes of lowering their consumption, whereas some set of people disagree. I total disagree with the reducing of the usage of resources in order to solve the environmental difficulty. \n\nFirstly, the method of rising the cost of private travelling can only make a little effect on nature protection. Since there are many other human activities, for example, the factories operation and aeroplane travelling, even emit more carbon dioxide and contaminated pollutants than driving a car. The government is better to form the regulations from other aspects instead of focusing on the pollutants producing from vehicles. The reducing demand for driving can only contribute to a small effort to solving the air pollution problem. Thus, rising the cost of personal transporting is relatively useless in achieving environmentally friendly development. \n\nSecondly, it is more effective for the government to carry out policies in pursuing sustainable national growth. By focusing on long-term development, the policymakers are recommended to explore new opportunities but not lowering people's quality of lives. There are some sources of alternatives, such as electronic car and renewable energy generation. All of these policies can safeguard the living standard of citizens. To strike a long-term sustainable achievement on natural protection, it is an ideal approach to look for new and high tech method on transportation.

So only in few country's the women\u2019s are in key role, similarly considering the company\u2019s or an  organisation, most of the jobs are in the hands of men. This is due to the many factors, such as; men grouping, the dominance of men in every field.\nIn a country or in a company, the majority of the key positions are handled by men, this situation has to be changed and the rulers should implement several new policies to reserve some portion of jobs for women. In several countries the ruler's has already passed several laws regarding this. For instance, in India, the system passed a rule that ensures thirty three percent of the seats in the assembly for the women. Similarly, many rules need to be implemented in companies to ensure that the women\u2019s are in the key position. The thinking that women should only be housewife has to be changed or wiped. Women are capable of doing anything, now days women\u2019s are in every plot, especially they are in those roles which were regarded as most difficult jobs and only meant for men. For instance, in the current era we have female pilots, women engineers in the field of oil exploration, etc. \nIn conclusion, most of the key position is handled by men, Moreover the discrimination between women and men should be wiped and government should pass several laws or policy favourable to this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Firstly, adolescenceis a complex phase and it is completely different from the other stages of psychological development. Teenagers during this phase are more inclined towards learning and exploring new things. Thus, engaging youngsters in voluntary community work such as helping students from poorer section of the society with their studies will increase their cognitive skills. Moreover,adolescents are less likely to involve in bad activities. For example,recent survey has shown that youngters who are participating in community work are reported less in juvenile crime and drug abuse cases.

Generally speaking, there are many underlying reasons for this trend. I believe that it has more positive aspects.\n\nBy all accounts, there could be a lot of reasons that can be pinpointed about this tendency. To begin with, many young individuals today value their freedom and personal growth before settling down. That means they feel that getting married early would limit their ability to enjoy life and pursue their own goals. For example, in the past, it was common for people to marry before the age of 30, but nowadays, individuals tend to delay marriage until after 30. Another reason can be that a significant number of people have a strong desire for travel and exploration over starting a family. Being single allows them the flexibility to travel whenever and wherever they want. \n\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that this trend has more merits than demerits. Firstly, having children is no longer seen as a mandatory part of life. For example, I have a friend who is over 30 and happily single, enjoying her life on her own terms. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant shift in people\u2019s perspectives. Secondly, older parents often have more established careers and higher incomes, which can provide a comfortable life for their children. Moreover, mature parents usually have a large support system which can be a valuable resource for both parents and children. \n\nIn conclusion, this trend has a great number of reasons behind it, which I believe has benefits."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: It is often argued that it's not wise to prevent climate change and we must think of ways to be compatible with it. I completely disagree with this idea and I believe it's much easier to prevent global warming from getting worse, and also we cannot afford its consequences.\n\nTo begin with, dealing with global warming results is much harder, while it's easier, and more achievable to take some simple yet fundamental steps. Air pollution is one of the main factors in global warming, and to be more specific, carbon dioxide produced as a result of fossil fuels, plays a major role in this pollution. Governments can significantly reduce CO2 production by applying extra tax on fossil fuel-based cars and encourage people to purchase electric vehicles. Also, people can be a great help in this situation, by making simple changes in their everyday life. For instance, they can commute to work by bicycle instead of taking a cab or worse, riding their own car.\n\nFurthermore, the consequences of prolonged and worsened global temperature rise are expensive, and it's too difficult to tackle. One of the first things that can occur as a result of it, is poles Ice melt, resulting in increased sea water level. This can cause lots of cities to sink, and many lives will be lost. For example,  recent research shows that if the world's temperature keeps rising at the current speed, the city of Bangkok in Thailand will go underwater by 2030. One more reason to argue is mass extinctions that could happen as a complication of global warming. Lots of species are at risk of extinction at this very moment, such as polar bears and penguins living in Antarctica.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that it's better to take steps to mitigate the world's temperature rising, because it's a lot easier to do so and we won't have to deal with its consequences."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

This essay totally agrees with this statement; I believe that they are setting a very bad example for the youth.\n\nFirst of all, teenagers are looking for a role model to follow their steps in real life, and by looking up to influencers, it can result in terrible consequences due to the fact that these celebrities don't actually preach about hard work but only glamour lifestyle; therefore, kids will be under the impression that this what success looks like, as a result, they'll try to imitate that rather than work. Moreover, by seeing how they are dressed, youngsters will tend to copy them by buying expensive clothes that they are not able to afford; thus, demanding extra cash from their parents that will be an extra burden on their shoulders. for example, a survey done in a shopping centre in London showed that most young individuals visit expensive stores more than others.\n\nSecondly, with the rise of social media, anyone can practically become famous, even by doing the stupidest things ever, and these individuals will surely be a bad role model for our kids, for instance, in Tiktok, users can get well known by only dancing.

Every person has personal and different reasons and has various ways to obtain information about the history of their abode.\n\nFirstly, one of the considerations as to why individuals desire to know about the past story of a property before buying is personal reasons. A person who bought a house might be a superstitious one who believes in paranormal activities which could influence the way he or she treats the asset because of this belief. Prior to occupation, there might be some rituals to perform in order to cast out the negativity that might have been caused by previous occurrences.  For example, in the US, there are several houses considered haunted because of unsolved crimes that happened in the past, the most common of these are in the countryside where there is an opportunity for evil-minded people to do such acts. So, for some individuals, it is paramount that every property acquired does not have a gruesome past. \n\nFurther, there are several means to gather information regarding the house that is about to purchase.

Also, it is important to know the reasons why the owner wants to sell it, there might have been a significant reason for it. For example, a politician sells his house because he wants to go abroad and decided to resign from his post according to him, but on the contrary, he wants to evade a possible investigation because of irregularities in obtaining it. Due to some other reasons that an asset is being sold, a buyer should seek facts before the acquisition.\n\nTo conclude, it is important to inquire about relevant information before buying a property especially for the place people called home.

While, it is possible that most of the simple jobs will be replaced, it is highly unlikely to take over skilled jobs that require human contact- to be performed by robots. This essay will discuss why majority of the jobs will be carried out by robots.\nRobots may eventually replace largely number of human labour that doesn\u2019t require sophisticated and complex human skills. They are cost-effective and significantly reduces the amount of money given that would otherwise be given to labourers. In addition, they are less time consuming as they are automatically programmed to carry out a particular task. In Dubai, for instance, all mega shopping malls use robotic cashiers thus, doing jobs without being paid heavily. Furthermore, it minimizes the human error that otherwise is impossible to be rectified. In Qatar, for example, all toll tax collections on motorways are done by robots, making it cost effective and less time consuming. For these reasons, robots will replace, by and large, most of the jobs in the near future.\nHowever, there are some human jobs that can\u2019t be replaced by robots because they will never achieve the capacity to do them.

It is argued whether to spend the revenue on constructing buildings such as museums or town halls which are helpful for public or renovating the ones which are already present. This essay will illustrate the advantages of investing in new buildings.\n\n Firstly, bringing up a new structure like museum in a place which is accessible to people would be more convenient. Rather than renovating the existing museum, which is in the outskirts of the town, selecting a land which is reachable by more people will be beneficial for both public and the government. In addition, the government will be profitable with the innovation of new structures. The architecture of the recently built building will be much more attractive than the old ones, which attracts more visitors and leads to increase in profit and revenue to the society.

To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but there are other methods that could also be used to improve it as imposing a stricter penalty, in my opinion, is not the only way to ensure safety on roads.\n\nOn the one hand, it is true that having a stricter punishment and increasing the penalties for irresponsible drivers would reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety. For example, it is a fact that using a mobile phone while driving a car is a dangerous act. However, due to the light punishment, many people still use the phone while driving. Should the authority change the punishment into a heavier one, then people will consider twice before they use the phone while driving. Besides, violation of any traffic rule can lead to a severe accident and if the punishment is made a stern, people would likely obey them.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another method that the government could use in improving road safety besides having a stricter punishment. The government could make a campaign about safety driving through various media which would show the effect of careless driving. For instance, the government could make a safety video about road safety and upload it in social media since the message will be effectively spread in this kind of media. As more people are watching these videos, it is hoped that drivers will have a clearer view of safety driving.\n\nIn conclusion, to a certain extent, I agree that having a stricter punishment would improve road safety.

However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.\nFirst of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.\nConversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while.

There are several reasons behind this situation, which are discussed in the further essay.\n\nTo begin with, there are a number of reasons, which have increased the curiosity of the people to find such information. The first one might be to know about the previous owners who used to live there. For instance, how many owners had left at that place, for how many years, how was the nature and so on. There are unusual touts to get in one's mind when one purchased the house. Moreover, information regarding construction is the second reason for this approach. For instance, if a building is getting weak by passing time, the recent folk, who live there want to know about this to find out the solution or help.\n\nApart from this, people can use a plethora of techniques to do some research and two of these are worth mentioning. They can talk to neighbours, Who lived for many years to find out about the past householders. He might be in touch with them and used to meet each other once in a while. Thus, they can provide brief information. Additionally, if they want to know about builders, then it would be easy to find former owners all from the government.

Therefore, it is crucial for all towns and mega police places to develop maximum large outdoor places such as squares and parks. I agree with this statement. This essay intends to extend points in the ensuing paragraphs. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons to implement  greenery places on the outdoor side of the house. The first and foremost reason is that trees can counteract  heavy pollution. Tress can be helpful to purify the toxic air from the environment. Also, it reduces noise pollution, which  mostly occurs due to high traffic and industries in mega police area.Therefore,growing trees can be helpful to provide clean air to  city dwellers. Moreover, it helps to maintain physical health as well as mental health. A park provides a clean and peaceful environment, which may relieve stress and anxiety. Additionally, the park provides various amenities to exercise for good well-being.\n\nFurthermore, this kind of place can improve the sense of community. In the modern are, people are living a hectic life. As a result, they can not specify their time even for their family members. Hence, it provides a good opportunity to activate social life by getting together. Lastly, the area would develop through some investors, who want to invest money in the grade city. It may beneficial for their residents. For instance, wealthy city dwellers are more likely to invest their money in local shops. Which are allocated in residential areas. Therefore, societies can easily get the products of their daily needs. \n\nTo conclude, I reiterate my opinion that the park and squares are beneficial for communities.

Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nEssay: In recent years, humans are heavily adapted to advanced technologies and it has become an integral part of life. Robots are considered to be one of the greatest innovations of mankind. Certain individuals believe that they are harmful to humans while some stratum of society argue that they are crucial for the future. I personally believe that robotics is a positive development for the world.\n\nTo begin with, some people assert that these techno-savvy machines can endanger human life. This is because robots are not emotionally intelligent to distinguish what set of operations are right or wrong; which can have a detrimental effect. To illustrate, a recent accident involving a Telsa electric car that killed two people points fingers at its autonomous driving feature. Moreover, these robots running on a specific algorithm are in the early stage of development that can be exposed to hacking. For instance, if these machines are employed in the banking sector, there is a high probable chance of account hacking and other fraudulent activities. \n\nOn the other hand, benefits derived from the invention of robots are significant for the development of the future. Most importantly, these automated machines can be deployed in places that are hazardous to humans. For example, a robot called Mini-Manbo has become the central part of the cleaning-up process in the damaged Fukushima reactor, where it is dangerous for humans to execute these tasks. Additionally, the heavy automation by robots in the automobile industry and hazardous chemical plants has reduced stress on employee\u2019s health and increased productivity and precision in these sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, although, some argue that robots can be potentially life-threatening and cannot be considered safe to be employed in various industries such as banking, I strongly believe that they can bring a positive change for the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

Although childbirth in old age might come with severe problems, it helps the parents to have money to cater for their children's education, and basic needs and be psychologically ready for it which I believe outweighs the disadvantage as the childbirth difficulties can be treated with adequate medical intervention, moreover, lack of preparedness can lead to mental illness of both couples.\n\nTo start, giving birth comes with several medical issues which are detrimental to the mother's health. Complications like Ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages (early pregnancy loss) congenital disorders, high blood pressure, and chromosomal condition like Down syndrome. For example, one of the Federal medical health care centres in Nigeria; reflected in a recently published report that; 70% of women who got pregnant at 35 years had ectopic pregnancy and preeclampsia. However, problems that come with child delivery in old age now have solutions. A scientist has found a way of preventing medical conditions  with the use of certain medications.\n\nTo add, one of the very important advantages of having a child late is mental preparedness and financial stability which helps both parents to be able to cater for their basic needs after childbirth. when both parents are mentally prepared, they tend to have peace of mind and also be able to cater for themselves and form intimacy together. For instance, in a survey conducted by World Health Organization(WHO), it was published that women that gave birth late in Nigeria are more responsible and care for their children more than others. Afterwards, women that gave birth at an early age abandon their children as a result of insufficient income and lack of mental preparedness which affect their child's education and mental well-being. Meanwhile, waiting till adulthood  before having a child is better.\n\nIn summary, despite the several complications that follow giving birth in advanced life, the merits outweigh its demerits as couples would be more prepared mentally and financially."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

What are some of the problems that shift workers might face? What can be done to solve them?\nEssay: There are many people who are doing night shifts. This essay will address problems like health hazards and disruption in family and social life, and also proposes effective solutions like rotating rosters and family support.\n\nTo commence with, working on nights has a direct effect on sleep. If a sleeping hour of a staff is reduced every day, he will be a victim of various diseases like anxiety, depression and mental health issue. For example, according The University of England, 55% of employer who works  night time is having the problem of anxiety. Likewise, working as a third shift will have a negative influence in the family and social relationship. That is to say, working lately, does not give enough time to the partner and children, which results in family dysfunction. Additionally, the involvement in social activities will also be reduced, which results in social marginalisation.\n\nOn the other hand, the first solution for such problem can be a rotating roster among the workers. Despite of a single person working the same night duty every week, if there is a rotating schedule, they can rest and the chance of suffering from various diseases is minimized. For instance, the WHO published a report in January 2020, that staff working in a swing shift is healthier than those who are working the same roster every day. Secondly, a full support of the family can make the night roster effective. If they are on the ball and maintains a peaceful environment at home so that the person working late shifts can take a rest, it won\u2019t be hard working lately. \n\nIn conclusion, doing graveyard shift can create various problems like health issues and disruption in family and social life; however rotating work schedule and support of family can help to minimize this issue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

There is a group of individuals who believe that the damage done by  mankind to these species is irreversible and there is nothing we can do now whereas a vast majority of  people think that  positive steps can lead to a better situation and steps should be taken in this regard. In my opinion, we can bring positive changes by mending our ways which include saving the biodiversity by increasing the awareness among the people. This essay discusses both aspects and provides  logical grounds for both by stating the facts.\n\nTo begin, since the establishment of man on this earth, humans have disturbed the balance of the ecosystem by exploiting it.Deforestation and, emissionthe emission of greenhouse gases have posed serious threats to our natural saviours such as the ozone layer. For example, the increased amount of gases released by refrigerators has caused the depletion of the protective layer. Consequently, animals and plants are more prone to harmful rays coming from the sun. Moreover, deforestation has led to more frequent floods, land sliding and a hike in salinity. As a result of these activities, some people are of the view that there is no going back. The loss done to the plantation as well as animals including their habitat is irreversible.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a wide majority of optimistic people who believe that it is still not too late to make this world a better place for our natural counterparts that are plants and animals. The condition of Flora and Fauna can be improved with drastic changes in our lifestyle and paying heed to their vital role in our environment. For Instance, awareness sessions should be conducted among the social clubs, and children at the school ought to learn the importance of plants and growing more trees. The cost of the plantation should be reduced to encourage people. All these steps contribute towards the betterment of the condition.\n\nIn conclusion, some people do not see bright chances of making things good again for animals and plants.

This essay will argue why I believe the advantages about people having children at later age outweigh disadvantages in the following paragraph.\n\nFirstly, there are many advantages to having children at a later age. To begin with, the most important family is ready to care for the children. Some parents think kids should be born when everything is enough for them such as money, education and love.

Although this measure may reduce the amount of toxic fumes that are released into the atmosphere to some extent, I believe there are several more effective alternatives to tackle environmental issues.\n\nOn the one hand, such a policy may help to lower emissions from certain modes of transport. As the price of fuel increases, commuters may resort to using public transport instead of using their own vehicles in order to save money. Moreover, drivers who are unwilling to spend more money on petrol will be encouraged to use vehicles that run on renewable and environmentally-friendly energy sources as an alternative, such as electric cars and bicycles. As a consequence, the number of privately-owned vehicles travelling on public roads would be significantly reduced, which in turn would significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year. This would effectively enhance the air quality.\n\nHowever, as environmental issues stem from many causes, there are several more suitable ways to address these problems. People\u2019s lack of awareness and knowledge about such problems is one of the primary underlying issues that results in pollution. Therefore, the government must educate the public about the current state of their environment and negative lifestyles in order to reduce the long-term impacts of their ignorance. Additionally, water pollution is a severe issue in many developing countries these days and is often found downstream from industrial zones where factories discharge toxic waste without proper treatment. Such an issue requires governments to implement stricter regulations to minimize the negative health impacts and help sustain the economy. \n\nIn conclusion, since each problem requires a unique solution, it is justifiable to say that increasing the price of fuel is not the single best resolution for environmental issues."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.5"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\nEssay: In today's time, human activities are having a dramatic effect on climate change of our planet and some people think that rather than taking measure's to prevent climate change, we should learn to live with it. I firmly disagree with this opinion and in this I will provide certain example's to back my argument.  These days, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at there highest level's since the past thousand's of years. This has caused many problems. For instance, people who live in polluted cities have difficulty in breathing, low fertility rate, lower life expectancy among infants and much more. All this combined with global warming and man made pollution has made it extremely difficult for nature to maintain it's equilibrium configration. This all amount's to drastic changes in our planet's climate and can also cause many natural habitats to go extinct. Under such circumstances, only us humans will be able to adapt to the climate changes, but not other species.  For example, consider the case of fishes. The continuous increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the vapourisation of polar ice caps. This has lead to an increase in the sea levels around the world. In such circumstances, the amount of human waste deposition into the sea and oceans around the world has also increased which has led to the deaths of countless fishes in these waters. Moreover, in some instances, these fishes were found to be dead on the shore of beaches and some found to be floating dead on the surface of the water. This is just one of the few examples that goes on to show, that although humans will be able to adapt to all the climate changes and find a way to live with these changes, majority of the animal kingdom population won't be able to do the same.  So in a nutshell, instead of finding a way to live with the changing climate, one should looks for ways to minimize it. By doing so, we won't only be saving our own natural habitat, but we will also be creating a more stable and livable enviorment for the future generation's to come.

I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.\nTo begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.\nAnother reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.\nTo conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

How can we solve this problem?\nEssay: Children\u2019s education has always been a matter of great concern for parents. In today\u2019s world, this has grown exponentially, mainly due to the constant changing world. One of the primary reasons for this, relates to a child\u2019s concentration and small attention span. This essay will attempt to dissect this cause and propose some reasonable solutions that could help with mitigating this issue.\nDue to a child\u2019s small attention span, conventional ways of teaching are inadequate in keeping their interest. In order to get through to a child, it is important to keep their interest for the duration of the study session or class and ensure they view it as a fun activity. Moreover, most schools find it hard to move away from traditional teaching methods such as dictation, using white boards, etc., especially in some developing countries, and as a result fail to engage their students. \nFurthermore, with massive technological growth in recent years, children are attracted towards their phones, tablets, computers, TV, etc. and provide a major source of distraction for them. Many studies have even linked the use of these devices to the release of endorphins resulting in a further dependency on technology. Combine this with the lack of engagement in classroom and education provider\u2019s resistance to adapting to the changing world results in children having difficulties in paying attention. \nThis issue needs to be tackled on two fronts. Firstly, parents need to monitor and limit the use of technology outside of school hours. A structured schedule would be a good start and usage of phones & tablets may even be incorporated into a reward system. Schools should take responsibility for the second front. It is vital for them to coach themselves on changing technology and how it can be utilized for providing quality education to children. For instance, the use of interactive applications, modern teaching methodologies or structuring and creating custom curriculum for each child, based on their learning abilities, interests, etc.\nIn conclusion, it is important to acknowledge and understand the problem, as well as its root cause, utilize modern solutions and creative thinking that caters for the ever-changing modern world.

However, whether imposing stricter penalties for driving offenses is the only way to protect people is still a controversial issue. Although I agree that harsher punishments can act as an effective way to deter people from committing road offenses, I believe that there are better methods to protect the welfare of road users.\n\nFirstly, it is obvious that the implementation of rules can act as a deterrent to would-be lawbreakers. For example, in Vietnam, a motorist not wearing helmet can be fined with $20 to $40, and thus he will be in fear of facing further punishment and avoid committing another offense. Furthermore, more stringent punishments for traffic crimes can\n\nbe efficient way to reduce traffic accidents. For instance, in the past, China witnessed a significant number of annual\n\nroad casualties when it had very loosely enforced regulations. However, once harsher laws related to road safety were implemented in 2009, there was a notable reduction in the total number of traffic accidents.\n\nThis is not to say that only by using stricter rules can we enhance the safety of our roads. It is true that there are still other effective measures to ensure people\u2019s safety, such as heightening people\u2019s awareness through the media about the consequences of committing driving offenses, or promoting the use of public transport systems such as buses or trains.

What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\nEssay: It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of \u2018street salespeople\u2019, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people\u2019s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today.

According to the opinion of the majority, many argue that all employment opportunities will be automated. However, as there are advantages, I believe, there are a plethora of drawbacks to society and in this essay, I will emphasize my opinion with examples.\n\nFirst of all, many jobs in the modern world require not only skills and experience but also human empathy and creativity. For example, the professions in the aged care category have to deal with adults who need love and affection and also, and caring should be done gently. If robots play the role of a carer those machinery cannot succeed in their work as humans. Moreover, automated Professionals cannot handle aggressive residents in care settings as they only have repetitive skills, and not the creativity to handle situations.  \n\nFurthermore, If all job types are invaded by robots, it can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate in the country. For instance, if a company is fully automated from the labor to management post, which previously had a full human labor force, those workers should go for other options to find jobs and to make their living. As a result of joblessness, many negative impacts will arise in the community like rising crime rates, shoplifting, and also, causing depression as people are always in stressful conditions.\n\nAlthough there are disadvantages, introducing robots has several positive impacts too.

There are multifarious approaches so that I agree with given statement. This essay intends to analyze methods of hiring new employees.\n\nUnquestionably, an interview is an important recipe of recruitment. It requires a detailed understanding of the organizational needs as well as a careful grasp of the prospective employee's responses. However, an employer can not fully access a candidate's capabilities, personality or charach during an interview. Sometimes, a candidate who possesses better qualifications may fail to get the job because of his poor performance in the interview. This system would be fruitful, when the recruitment is a small scale and only a few employees are needed.\n\nThere are many other methods, which can be employed to hire personnel. In my opinion, interviews should not be the only criterion for selecting candidates. It should be used in conjunction with written tests during which a candidate's proficiency and knowledge in various subjects can be assessed. In addition, candidates should be asked to participate in debates or group discussions. Their real personality and leadership skills will come on the floor during these events. After this, it is important to check the reference to ascertain the authenticity of what is written in the resume.\n\nAnalysing the above mentioned methods, it is inevitable that no single method is perfect.

To these, some are of the opinion that parents are largely to blame, while others disbelive this notion, and ascribe the evil deeds to the young devils themselves.Hence, the contention arises, are parents really to blame or does the brunt goes to the children? Let's delve deeper.\n\nTo begin with, children always fall prey to temptations especially the young adults-15 to 19-, and pressures  from their peers causes them to go into all manner of sins.Due ot this, when they are caught, the whole consequence of the action must be remmitted by punishment on them.For instance, a child is caught bullying another.The parents cannot be dragged along because, the perpetuator of the crime was the child.It would not make  any sense to blame or reprimand the parents for the cause.\n\nSecondly,there are rules, and youngsters are not ignorant to the fact of it; they themselves, are able to know the measures that follow if they disobey these rules.Therefore, it will be safe to agree that when they cross the lines they are solely to blame and not their daddies or mommies, except they are a too young to know between right or wrong then an exception is the case.\n\nOn the other hand, if truth is to be told,  there are some cases where the parents are solely at fault.These predominant set of cases are often due to bad character and bad training.The former is normally the case when they themselves are the crime offenders or they overlook the crime.For example, a parent can walk into a store and issue his/her child to pilfer an item or more than often he/she sees them pickng an item and leaving the shop without the cashier's notice.\n\nMeanwhile, the latter is more often than not the case nowadays.Parents train up their wards with bad vices at home and when they grow up, they manifest with these characters\n\nAs a whole,people tend to put the blame mostly on the young people while others on their  caretakers, but the truth is, it can be both.It will be safe in my opinion, to punish the one's who actually committed the crime.In this case,if it is the child that is caught, he/she takes the offense,but otherwise the parents can be consulted,rather than punishing them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.5"}]}

There might be more priority in which officials should spend the national budget on them . For example, in underdeveloped countries where there are not enough schools and hospitals, paying pension might be considered a last priority such as in Africa people even do not have anything to eat or drink . In these places, so, it would be better to improve their sanitation and education systems as well as facilitating hospitals. Moreover,society should be modernised in terms of transportations to make  commuting much easier for every citizen.

There are a lot of scientists and professors who dedicated most of their precious adolescence to study and improve the life quality of their fellow citizens through their innovations . If they did not do all these activities, now we would not have a prosperous society.

However, I do not fully agree with the above statement and this essay will discuss the reasons below.\n\nFirst of all, there is no doubt about the benefits of doing community work regardless of the pay as doing something for society will always be returned manifolds. For example, when we take care of the elderly, they often bless us for our future endeavours and also share their invaluable life experience which can help an individual in tackling similar situations if they arise.

Be that as it may, getting paid for this service is a different issue. Sometimes , teenagers can lose interest in things which do not give tangible rewards. Therefore, giving a wage, even if it is small, will definitely attract more people towards community service.

Firstly, an immature child is highly addicted to the feeling of going through the next levels of a game or boosting score to break a record. This type addiction can also cause some problems with their school, a lack of sleep or unfinished homework are consequences of spending for a few more hours on the playstation.

Lastly, It can be noticed that the themes of a majority of the video games are prominently based on violent battle. Overindulgence to such games makes the young minds of children susceptible to emotional indifference.\n\nOn the other hand, virtual games can be both entertaining and educational. To begin with, these games encourage imagination as well as concentration, which are useful skills in real life.

Some others believe that literature for kids to become good citizens is way more important. I partially agree with the statement, the essay will interpret some related reasons.   \n\nFirstly, the presence of a country is constructed by a society, which involves the citizens, buildings, systems and forth on. Naturally, becoming a decent resident or a valuable worker must be an essential element of a country. Throwing back to the past, educating the crowds and teaching them knowledge were the begins of the schools. To illustrate, in the Japanese colonial period, Taiwan's schools only taught students the knowledge of agriculture and business. Therefore, they could serve the public and benefit society when they graduated.\n\nOn the other hand, due to the improvement of technology and medicine, the social value and aims have completely transferred. Thus, people tend to spend more time and money on pursuing their careers or future lives. Likewise, the school is regarded as an organisation that offers children opportunities and dreams. For instance, nowadays universities establish a variation of departments and all kinds of exchange schemes for students to experience their life widely. Additionally, increasing  interpersonal value can also enhance the quality of society and the living standards of citizens. \n\nTo conclude, despite the difference in the standing views, the debates will always exist.

People often tend to contradict whether the primary role of Government is to build its economy or to work on helping the financially weaker people.

This will keep the country stand among the developed nations and increases the overall value of its products and resources in international market. For example, China has seen a greater rise in its overseas market after investing majorly in the improvement of its economy.

Since the masses are the backbone of any state, offering good education, health, accommodation and working conditions will improve the overall performance of the country.

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?\nEssay: Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.\nTwo major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.\nOn the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.\nAlthough the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development.

For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison. Do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels. Although this way could be associated with some benefits, I believe that the government should implement better alternatives to tackle the problem\n\nAdmittedly, educating criminals in prisons could be beneficial for alleviating the crime rate. For one thing, education for offenders in prison provides them some fundamental knowledge to pursue higher education programs and may change their awareness. Countries such as Singapore, where to allow prisoners to study during the execution of the sentence, regularly have the lowest crime rate among the parts of the world. For another, offering a learning program in prisons for criminals could be regarded as a way of assisting them to get a job after release from prison. In fact, some prisons enable inmates to learn vocational training such as computer programming, graphic design, which may facilitate them to earn a living. This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively.\n\nHowever, there are some reasons why education could not be considered as a proper measure for offenders during their time in prison. Firstly, such a form of education is offered for those who engage in wrongful acts, and therefore this could diminish the crime level to a certain extent. Instead, equipping students with crime knowledge in school will help shape crime prevention thinking and awareness for students, which will significantly reduce crime rates in the long term. Secondly, for some criminals who could not change their minds by educating, harsh punishment or even serving longer sentences would be better. Indeed, for some white-collar crimes who have highly educated and high positions in society, such as lawyers or doctors, there is no point in educating them rather than implementing a policy of zero tolerance.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: In recent times, it is usually believed that the government setting up free learning for six years is the superior way to reduce poverty in developing countries. In my view, I completely agree with this statement because of the free schooling, residents have the opportunity to learn the fundamental knowledge, contributing to the growth of the country.\n\nTo begin with, free school fund allows dwellers to acquire the basis of awareness, making an attempt to develop the nation. Regardless of their background, everyone can access  basic education, having the ability to read, write and use numbers. As a result, they are able to have more career opportunities with their high-level labour and better wages. For instance, the survey in Vietnam showed that those with high levels of education are paid 3 times higher salaries than people without literacy levels. Due to the free study, the quality of life as well as the homey's growth will be better. \n\nFurthermore, the government's investment in education for people, especially those in highland areas, brings positive effects on the development of the country. In fact, the population in mountainous areas often have fewer educational opportunities than the community in plain areas, leading to economic difficulties, and causing a gap between rich and poor and economic imbalance. Free teaching for people here gives everyone the opportunity to acquire basic knowledge, bringing more effective income, and shortening the economic income gap between the highlands and the plains. Thanks to that, poverty in developing countries is also significantly reduced.\n\nIn conclusion, free education for up to six years for people is an optimal method for reducing poverty in developed countries, it helps people access basic knowledge, brings great job opportunities with higher income, and contributes to national development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.5"}]}

In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways.

Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually.

What can be done to solve this problem?\nEssay: In the century of technological advances, there is a high demand for consumer goods in the market. Therefore, many companies aim to manufacture the tremendous number of products to be capable of competition with their rival companies. However, while aiming for more profit, CEOs do not consider the negative impact of production on the environment, such as greenhouse gas emissions and soil acidification. These issues can be avoided by  restriction  the amount of second-need consumer goods and developing an optimal recycling system.\n\nFirst and foremost, the environment suffers from greenhouse gases- the waste of manufacturing processes. Greenhouse gases lead to  global warming which has consequences in rising sea level, burning fire, and other natural disasters. In order to prevent the outcomes of human action, the production field of each country has to limit their manufacturing level. For instance, the government can restrict the supply of consumer goods of lesser importance. Undoubtedly, limited products are accompanied by increasing inflation and resulting in economic crisis; however, preserving nature remains  the topic of first importance. \n\nSecondly, scraps from factories negatively affect  the land and its components. Thrown debris grows into huge garbage dumps, which acidifies land. Thus, soil becomes unsuitable for plant growth, affecting  the ecosystem. Herbivores disappear without food supply (plant) and other predators due to their death, compete to prey more aggressively. Thus, the whole living community will suffer, leading its distraction. To solve this issue, people should develop a recycling system, which will result in decreasing number of garbage and neutralizing of soil.\n\nIn conclusion, humanity is the part of living ecosystem, so the environmental issues directly affect to their surroundings.

Several factors may relate to this phenomenon which I believe is a positive development.  \n\n   \n\nThe advent of this trend is complex, possibly involving many factors. Firstly, advances in network technology allow people to get access to the products information easier, making the advertisement less attraction than before. For example, details of many products can be accessed by consumers through their official websites rather than watching their advertisement. Another reason is that more and more offline stores have been established and they are important channels for people to learn the goods. The advantages are obvious, because these physic stores fulfill people's curious while avoiding them to spend a lot to buy the expensive goods. Besides, people can get information from some product launches as many large companies like Apple and Google, will introduce their new products before they are provided to the market.  \n\n   \n\nI think this is a positive trend which means that people are more reasonable to choose their interested goods.

It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. \n\nTo begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. \n\nSecondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. \n\nTo conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.5"}]}

This complex issue stems from a multitude of factors, and finding a solution requires a collective endeavor involving all stakeholders.\n\nThere exist several catalysts behind the expansion of the consumer industry and its subsequent negative impact on the environment. Chief among these is the rapid proliferation of consumerism. As the demand for goods escalates, the corresponding need for increased production becomes apparent. Consequently, industries engaged in manufacturing these goods have intensified their utilization of water, energy, and raw materials, resulting in the depletion of our precious natural resources. This challenge is further aggravated by inadequate environmental regulations that often fail to dissuade factories from releasing hazardous chemicals and toxic emissions into the surroundings.\n\nAddressing these pressing environmental concerns necessitates collaborative actions from individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies. Firstly, it becomes imperative for governments to launch campaigns aimed at enhancing public awareness regarding the dire environmental consequences of rampant consumerism. Armed with a comprehensive understanding of these repercussions, individuals are more likely to embrace environmentally conscious behaviors, including refraining from excessive purchasing and transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives. This shift in consumer behavior, in turn, exerts pressure on companies and manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices. Simultaneously, it is essential to bolster punitive measures against factories that disregard proper waste management, including longer business suspensions and legal repercussions for those responsible for such environmental transgressions. This two-pronged strategy holds promise for significantly mitigating the detrimental effects stemming from heightened consumer goods production on the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the unchecked growth of consumerism, coupled with lenient environmental regulations, has paved the way for an expanding consumer industry that significantly impacts our environment. Nevertheless, this challenge can be effectively addressed through coordinated efforts from governments, citizens, and corporate entities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.\nIn extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.\nAnother reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.\nWhat I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9.0"}]}

While it is a commonly held belief that people should not stay in a job where they do not enjoy what they are doing, there is also an argument that opposes it. In my opinion, I consider that it is not necessary for employees to enjoy what they do, they need to be professional in their jobs only.\n\nTo begin with, employees should focus on increasing their experiences rather than enjoying their jobs. In other words, the main goal for the individuals should be to gain more experience and leverage their skills to have much better opportunities. In addition, people usually are keen on having higher salaries which would make them satisfied with their jobs' rewards. For example, senior employees, who have more experience, usually, they would be satisfied because they enjoy their level of convenient living.\n\nAnother point to consider, working in a healthy environment is significantly important because this would impact the quality of your work. It is also possible to say that, it is more essential to pursue having a balanced healthy work environment than seeking for enjoyment. Moreover,  there are many other factors that may affect the quality of your job and impact you to enjoy what you are doing. For instance, friendly lovely colleagues, supportive managers, and appreciation, all of these factors would affect you psychologically to enjoy or hate your job.\n\nIn conclusion, despite people having different views, I believe that there are many factors that could impact your business life, which would encourage you to stay or leave, and enjoyment is not everything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

Therefore, producing myriad commodities also means that mankind is damaging the planet. The causes of this issue and feasible solutions will be explained in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, producing goods will damage the environment. To explain, factories emit a large sum of Co2 during the fabricating process and, in turn, will have a negative impact on the globe such as global warming and natural disasters. Take China as an example, the world's biggest developing country, which is called the world factory, in this country are located myriad factories so air pollution is a very severe concern. In fact, in several cities in China, the air quality is quite bad and rarely people can see a blue sky. Another cause worth mentioning is deforestation, individuals every day cut down countless trees to produce commodities and furniture.\n\nMoving further, feasible solutions to the problem mentioned above could be the fast switch to renewable energies. To elaborate, if the world's energies come from eco-friendly sources, then producing commodities will not release Co2 anymore. For example, once factories receive energy from renewable ones such as solar, and wind, they will not damage the environment because these energies are eco-friendly. In fact, most developed countries like Europe and America, are setting up some targets to achieve.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?\nEssay: It is true that a rise in production leads to a wide range of environmental problems. There are many steps which can be taken by governments and individuals to deal with this issue.\n\nProducing excessive products has a significantly negative impact on our planet. Many reasons cause this case. First of all, for the sake of making more profit, many companies are producing goods as much as they can, this puts extremely great pressure on natural resources. For example, plenty of rainforests which are vital to stabilize climate change are destroyed to make paper. At the same time, due to a lack of supervision, many factories, which use fossil fuel energy,  pay no attention to limiting the emission of greenhouse gases, as a result, the more products they produce, the more they contribute to  global warming. Lastly, From a personal perspective, the promotion of new products encourages consumers to update and replace their commodities frequently, this may cause more hazardous substances to be discharged into the natural environment.\n\nHowever, there are many steps that governments and individuals could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, authorities can introduce laws to reduce the emission of waste air, such as increasing taxes on the use of coal and oil, in this way, plants can be forced to manage to use green energy. Furthermore, providing subsidies can be seen as a means to encourage companies to invest in researching alternative materials, in order to avoid  the excessive consumption of natural resources. Lastly, an essential solution is to educate people about the importance of protecting the natural environment, accordingly, consumers may think twice when they make the purchase.\n\nIn conclusion, governments and individuals can do much more to avoid unnecessary production and to protect our planet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

Several problems result from this phenomenon and some solutions should be tackled by the government and individuals to improve the situation.\n\nThe growing population in the large city has brought two main problems. To begin with, many young people have difficulty getting employed due to the competitive job market. This is because rural people tend to migrate to urban areas for better job opportunities, leading to a large number of young job seekers struggling to find employment.

First of all, it will help children have equal education opportunities, especially mountainous areas.

While some people argue that it is better to get a diploma, others believe the best option is to go straight to the job market after school. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then explain why I believe getting a job after school is better. \n\nThere are people who argue that getting a diploma is more appropriate to become successful. This is because they believe that the academy will teach the theory and knowledge necessary to achieve success. For example, to an engineer, a course will teach all the maths needed to perform this job. In addition, they believe that at the university people will build the necessary network to achieve the best spots and, therefore, it would be essential to have a studying plan in an institution to succeed. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who argue that getting a job straight after  school is the path to success. They have this opinion because they consider work experience as a key factor in a successful career. To illustrate, many CEOs of famous companies, such as Sergey Brin and Jeff Bezos, did not visit a college or a university. Besides, they argue that going straight to the job market is the fastest route to success because they believe people who enrol in a course is losing precious time that could be better spent directly performing the job.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe both sides have their merits.

Taking this into account, prices of daily needs like food and fuel decrease which makes it feasible to be bought by all classes of the society.

Thus, this sort of increase leads to harmony and satisfaction among people. \n\nOn the other hand, developing economies might lead to an adverse effect on Mother Nature as the demand elevates specifically in the case of housing.

Although they make an effort to focus on the class it is a hard task. This essay will discuss what are probably reasons for this problem and what can be done to address it.\n\nFirstly, with the advance of the fast-paced world, people are always very busy both in their private life and their professional life and this phenomenon happens also with school-age children. Certainly, the logic for the lack of focus and attention are both the pressure of the parents and a huge variety of activities in which graduates are submitted during the day. For instance, nowadays doing a variety of extra activities outside of the school such as dance lessons, swimming classes the young student has a life as busy as life`s adult. In addition, many parents punish their kids if they do not have a great score in the educational department how if this was the most important thing of life. Both pressures take off the attention and focus of the pupils which can lead to low academic performance.\n\nDue to previous reasons is necessary to promote a healthy life to students once without so much pressure they will perform much better in the educational department. Therefore, parents and schools should incentive the practice of physical exercise as an alternative to outlet the stress. For example, sport is the best way to keep focal point once it teaches about discipline and behaviour. Besides, the family should not overwhelm pupils with a lot of activities. Children need to have the responsibility and duties of a child rather than having the obligation of an adult. The more pupils are overwhelmed, the less the attention on the school subjects.\n\nIn conclusion, nowadays graduates should be stimulated with pleasure activities because the pressure will minimize their attention.

However , I am of the opinion that this is a matter to be debated in  light of several factors before a reasonable conclusion can be drawn.\n\nThe first and foremost is that many high-level professions such as a doctor, engineer, nurse etcetera required intensive knowledge in a certain field. To attain such skills university educations is the only way as it includes theoretical as well as practical knowledge of subjects.The earlier hard work helps them to reap benefits later in life such as economic prosperity. For example, Software engineering has six months hand-on training to get the final degree which makes them able to work practically in their corporate companies.The second worth-mentioning the reason is that some jobs have strict criteria to apply for it such as civil jobs, engineering jobs, doctor jobs, Human resources jobs.For instance, to acquire a position in human resource department of an MNC, one should have a master of business administration or in the same way on in the same way to establish a hospital an individual must have a degree in doctorate.Moreover, higher education is also a symbol of respect as people always treat a person respectfully who have a higher position in eminent career fields.\n\nOn the contrary, joining job after secondary education also has had a positive aspect. Job after schooling help young individuals become able to support their family economically and pay for their own expenses, which leads to a higher sense of maturity, in dependability.Besides this, some students who weak in studies are good in extra curriculum activities like sports, music. Therefore they prefer to choose their hobby as a career and live a better life as compared to highly skilled individuals. To illustrate, eminent Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who used to fail in exams during school days, has started his career just after completing schooling, now is famous for his batting records.\n\nTo conclude, although choosing a career path has some benefits, but in today's era of competition getting a highly paid job after schooling is almost impossible. Nevertheless, college education not only burdens the intellectual horizons of individuals but also make them able to attain a highly paid and lucrative job, which helps them to lead a financially stable life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.0"}]}

While I agree that living with climate change will be unavoidable for us in the future, I can see no reason for us to put aside our plans to cease the development of global warming.\n\nFor the first part, it is commonly known that the main cause leading to climate change is ozone layer depletion. As the ozone layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere serves as the shield protecting us from sun rays and heat, its gradual loss exposes our planet directly to the Sun.

It is a current increase in temperature of the Earth    `s atmosphere, water, and surface. Human activities produce greenhouse gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and cause problems our planet faces today. Global warming can do more than just melt polar ice and change weather patterns throughout the world.\n\nIt can change our maps, displace people from tropical islands and cities, and cause famine. There is no debate within the scientific community. The scientific evidence of the global warming is clear. The consequences of this global problem will only intensify if we do not confront the realities of climate change.

People should be prepared for the inevitable consequences of the global warming. It is our today`s reality and we should be responsible for doing so much harm to our planet Earth.\nTeachers often ask their students to write essays on global warming in order to expand their understanding of this serious problem and make them take action as individuals. Here are some important facts of global warming causes, impacts, and solutions that will help you write a persuasive essay.\n\n   The facts on global warming you should know to write a good essay\n\nOne of the most obvious effects of global warming is extreme weather. The weather patterns are rapidly changing in all parts of the world. The increased rainfall in certain regions affects the balance that animals and plants need to survive. Climate changes cause health problems, animal migration, and the lack of food resources. Extreme heat and droughts in diverse regions of our planet have become disastrous to human health. The frequency of the heavy precipitation has lead to the greater prevalence of floods. Global warming creates more natural disasters. Extreme weather events will continue to occur with greater intensity. So, we will experience significant changes in seasonal temperatures variations, wind patterns, and annual precipitation.\n\nThe effects of global warming on plants and animals are expected to be widespread and profound. Many organisms are migrating from the equator toward poles in order to find more comfortable conditions for their existence. However, a lot of animals go extinct as they are not able to compete in new climate regime. Global warming can cause the disappearance of up to one-third of Earth`s animals and one-half of plants by 2080.\n\nThe effects of climate change due to the global warming can be devastating to the human society. People can face severe crop failures and livestock shortages that will cause civic unrest, food riots, famines, and political instability in the whole world. Global warming threatens our future health conditions. Humanity will experience an increase in tick-borne and mosquito-borne diseases. What is more, people have become more vulnerable to extreme weather and climate changes that lead to serious mental health issues.\n\nThe sea-level rise accelerates 0.12 inches per year in overage worldwide. This trend will continue if gas emissions remain unchecked. People are to blame for rapidly melting ice, warming oceans, and rising sea levels. Coral reefs are in danger as the ocean warms. Two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef has been damaged as a result of climate change. Global warming increases the acidity of seawater because of the increase of the levels of CO2. The ocean is 26 percent more acidic than before the Industrial revolution. Melting glaciers endanger human life on the coastal areas. It can cause landslides and other land collapses.\n\nIncrease in average temperatures is the major problem caused by global warming. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 100 years. 2016 was the hottest year on record worldwide. Such temperatures turn our environment into a breeding ground for infections and diseases. The worst thing is that increased dryness and greenhouse gases serve as natural fuels for wildfires.\n\nScientists have predicted the effects for the future based on the climate changes due to the global warming problem. Snow cover is projected to contract. Sea ice is projected to shrink in both Antarctic and Arctic. Future tropical cyclones will become more intense. Heavy precipitation events, heat waves, and hot extremes will become more frequent. Arctic late-summer sea ice can disappear by the end of the 21st century. Sea level rise and anthropogenic warming will continue for centuries.\n\nPeople should cut power consumption in order to reduce the effects of global warming.  We should buy less polluting cars, get more efficient refrigeration, and reduce water heating requirements. We should also fly less or not at all. Such measures will definitely influence modern society a lot. However, it is important for ever"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.0"}]}

This trend will continue while the state will never have a chance to develop because beetween countries are always need to collaborate in any circumstances as a result many foreigners are gotten employment cpmpared to local state human. For instance,a recend survey said that many underdeveloped nations are suffered to this plan in form to they are lost their original uniqueness.\n\nTo conclude, undoubtedly this project is brought  both positive as well negative.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?\nEssay: In the metropolitan cities, there has been a surge in traffic. The people face enormous problems due to an increase in the automobiles on the roads. This essay will illustrate the reasons for the disturbing growth in traffic congestion, and in addition to that, it will shed light on the solutions to avoid it in subsequent paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, the predominant reason for unprecedented growth in traffic is flexible rules. To illustrate this view, cities like New Delhi and Bangalore have recorded the highest number of traffic penalties in the last three years and yet, these cities charge the bare minimum in road fines. Moreover, another critical reason that yields humongous traffic is overpopulation. Overpopulation leads to mismanagement and consequently, that results in inexorable chaos.\n\nIn order to manage a huge volume of automobiles on the road, the government should come up with stringent rules. For instance, the Gulf countries have imposed exorbitant fines pertaining to breaking traffic rules. This ensures the citizens of the country avoid breaking rules. Lastly, the concerning bodies should promote public transport in the nation. In addition to that, there should be a limitation on the usage of private vehicles. To exemplify, the Chief Minister of Delhi introduced an Odd-Even policy that allowed only odd and even car numbers to run on alternate days respectively. This resulted in bringing down the traffic.\n\nTo conclude, the unexpected growth in traffic congestion is due to lenient rules and overpopulation. To manage the chaos on roads, the governing bodies should impose adamant traffic rules and exorbitant penalties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.0"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Nowadays, climate change is a popular topic among countries. It is often argued that  people should be conscious of the climate change issue. Some people think we have not solved this problem. I totally disagree with this opinion because it creates lots of problems and can affect the ecosystem.\n\nOn the one hand, environmental issues and world problems are caused by climate change. If  people do not deal with this issue, nature will be destroyed. Climate change can cause flooding or forest fires that can demolish the habitat of wild animals. Then, it leads to animal extinction and the ecosystem will disappear because the food webs are cut. Not only wild animals get these effects but also humans such as rising temperatures cause heat stroke or desertification that make people unable to grow crops and it causes starvation.\n\nHowever, we cannot find the method to live with this hazardous problem. We need to seek possible solutions to tackle this problem such as planting the forests and prohibiting deforestation that makes the ecosystem change in a negative way. Using alternative energy instead of fossil fuels which can release exhausted gases and it causes global warming. For instance, in the UK, many people love to drive electric cars such as Tesla. This is why the air pollution rate in the UK lessened in the last year.\n\nIn conclusion, I completely disagree that we have to find a way to live with this vital problem.

In addition, if any people get learning about their home, they may know many thing regarding their home.

Others feel that this would result in a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.\nEssay: An improving the quality of education is the top priority of every nation. some think that students have the right to evaluate  their's staff members while others say that this can lead to affecting negatively. However, this essay discusses both viewpoints, I strongly agree with the former opinion for the following reasons. \n\nTo begin with, the school adminstration should be motivated to their's pupils which is any problem about their's staff members in classroom and they do not explian clearly any lesson while students tell freely to the management. This can lead to developing to tehir's knowledge as well as the teachers also would give more attention and explian briefly. In addition, the management should put in a suggestion box in every class inside and the students would be written any compliants without mentioning name. Taking Melbourne for example, in every school has followed to the suggestion box, thus, pupils can get more rights and wisdom from the quality of teachers and this can create a close bonding with tutors and students. \n\nIn contrast, this extra right can be affected student's respect and behaviour towards the professors, sometimes they unwantedly criticize their's tutors, thus, this can distroy the harmony relationship between teacher and school children. If a school girl only gives respect towards professors otherwise she always gives more attention to find out any mistake to lecturer, as a result, academic result might affect. For instance, in India has followed these kinds of suggstion box in classroom, thus, the students did not give more focus to their's academic syllabus instead of they have liked to find out mistake to the examiner lecture, hence, the management have stopped immediately this new right. \n\nTo conclude, the school commitees should be encourged to their's pupils will tell openly about their's examiners mistake and evaluation about their's teaching method. This can affect the students respect and obey towards teacher and classroom. However, in my opinion, about this, these kinds of freedom would be affected respect and discipline who are pupils towards their's professors.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nEssay: Education is a vital task for every student. Teachers teaching students in the classroom is the normal education procedure in every country, but according to some, it is true that typical teaching situations will change in 2050, as the education sector is at a developing pace around the globe. I completely agree with the aforementioned viewpoint and the following essay will elaborate on my answer further in detail. \n\nTo commence with, the normal system of teaching students in classrooms will change to online teaching methods. Where both educators and learners can attend the class through a certain website and it is convenient for both parties. Additionally, in the past students and teachers used to refer to numerous resources with the help of books as well as children studied hours scrolling pages of books to find information regarding their learning, but with the development in online teaching and learning methods learning as well as finding data will be effective and efficient. As an example, the schools are already following the online teaching methodology. Typical classrooms in schools will be shut down as a result of new online classrooms. \n\nOn the other hand, in the ,future there will be no longer teachers to teach the children. Every style of teaching and providing information will be done through the use of Artificial Intelligence. This method will be adequate for many children, where they have to use a few buttons to click and their voice to learn new things. According to research countries such as UK and US are already on the front line for testing AI teaching methods. However, children will adapt to artificial intelligence learning techniques in the near future. \n\nTo conclude, I strongly agree the classic method of teaching in classrooms will change for online teaching and Artificial Intelligence teaching methods by 2050."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}

Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\nEssay: Undoubtedly, with the rapid change of technology, people who decide to complete things instantly has been becoming more common and normal. Whereas some people refer to get things done instantly as a good development, others think upon it as a drawback and a block of revolution. As for my perspective, I consider the negative effect overwhelm the positive one.\n\nAn array of reasons may lead to why finishing things instantly is a negative effect. Firstly, people who have the ability to solve the tasks persuade more effective and efficient of complete jobs. In the other words, those who want to save more time to get high outcomes or profit. It might be a good influence of development. Furthermore, sometimes completing things instantly might make people look down the services and think of it as low prices.\n\nOn the other hand, as far as I am concerned. Firstly, only focus on saving time might cause people to forget to focus on details in the long term and it also makes a number of mistakes which people do not want it happen. Take my experience for example. While I trying to solve the math examination as soon as possible, I make a lot of stupid mistakes of easy questions. Therefore, getting things done instantly might decrease the willing of improving skills.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\nEssay: In the ever-connected modern world, some people think that we are more dependent on each other, while others argue that we have spread our wings and become individualistic. I agree with the latter stance, and in the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall discuss points and reasons to support my view.\n\nThere are several reasons for arguing that we are more dependent than ever on others. Firstly, life has become inherently difficult. With the high cost of living, young individuals depend on their parents or partners to fulfil basic needs like food, shelter, and education. Secondly, humans have become more ambitious. Hence, to compete better, they sometimes tend to depend on their parents to look after their kids, pets, and house. \n\nHowever, people have also become self-supporting in several senses. For example, in many countries, formerly-joint families have fragmented into numerous nuclear families and handle both personal and professional spaces like champions. Moreover, humans now utilise global connectivity to its optimal extent as they are seen studying in universities abroad, living in different countries and often travelling alone. Even more so, people have adapted to living and working alone. Furthermore, women have become financially independent and make their own decisions which prove that societies are gradually moving towards a more self-reliant stance.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that humans are still dependent on each other for the basic necessities and for maintaining connections with others since they are social animals. But, recent trends suggest that they as a species have become more self-sufficient than ever before, and I predict our independence will only gain prominence in the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8.5"}]}
