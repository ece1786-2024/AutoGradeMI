"Prompt: In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?
Essay: In recent years, many people are concerned to discover the history of their residence. This essay will explore what might be the causes and methods of how  society can find out the information. 

The primary reason for exploring their residence is due to the huge investment in owning a property. Therefore, they are keen on taking precautious measures to secure their financing, which can be threatening if the property has terrible notorieties. For instance, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people fear such incidents will somehow happen in the future. This bad reputation could drop the market value of the place. Besides that, homeowners are more concerned about the durability of their house structures due to climate change that affects every continent in the world.

There are various methods to discover it. The first one is to find any news related to the districts you live in on the internet. Secondly, to interview local residents in the town as they have been living in a particular area for a long time, they must have heard many myths as well as experienced some by themselves. In this case, individuals can acquire first-hand evidence. Thirdly, paying a visit to the construction office as they can provide the details about materials to build the houses. 

In conclusion,  in many countries, people are more intrigued by the history of the places they intend to live in, for various reasons such as their families' safety and money investment. There are many approaches to find out how the houses are built: internet, local persons and offices.",8.5,"**Task Response:**
Your essay addresses both parts of the question: the reasons people are interested in the history of their homes and how they can conduct research. You present relevant ideas and examples that support your response, indicating a well-developed argument. It's important to ensure that you provide a balanced discussion; more emphasis on both parts of the question equally can enhance your response. For example, you could elaborate a bit more on the methods or add additional reasons for such interests.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**
Your essay is generally coherent and organized logically. The progression of ideas is clear, moving from the reasons to methods and concluding effectively. However, the transitions between ideas and sentences could be smoother. For example, using cohesive devices such as ""additionally,"" ""furthermore,"" and ""moreover"" can help build stronger links between your points. The use of paragraphs is appropriate, but each paragraph could begin with a clearer topic sentence.

**Lexical Resource:**
You demonstrate an adequate range of vocabulary, using some less common words and phrases such as ""notorieties"" and ""durability."" Be careful of word choice errors like ""precautious measures"" (use ""precautions"" instead) and ""notorieties"" (consider using ""notoriety"" as it’s usually uncountable in this context). Continue to work on expanding your vocabulary range to include more precise and varied expressions.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
Your grammatical accuracy is generally good, with a mix of simple and complex sentence structures. Watch out for parallelism errors or awkward constructions, such as ""For instance, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people fear such incidents will somehow happen in the future."" Opportunities for improvement include ensuring parallel structure and avoiding awkward phrasing—""For instance, if a criminal act, such as a murder, has occurred in a building.""

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**
1. **Balance the Discussion:** Ensure that each part of the question receives equal attention in your essay.
2. **Improve Transitions:** Use more cohesive devices to link ideas smoothly.

"Prompt: In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding

out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own

knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
Essay: In the modern world, many people have increasingly paid attention to their houses or buildings, and they also make an effort to find a large amount of information about the house and building. In this essay, I discuss the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house and suggest a way to reach materials about them. 

I believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research a house or building. The most important one is that these days, a number of people consider their own houses or buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansions by making a sale or purchasing them, which means that they believe that their houses could be an effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their houses or buildings as products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize the historical value of their building where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get interested in gaining plenty of stories which the property contains, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. 

When it comes to people who want to know about their own house, they could utilize many ways to get useful knowledge. The simplest strategy is that just questioning  elder family members, and neighbours living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is a also pretty efficient way for people to search for a copy of a house deed, which is a document specifying details of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of their house or building, they would get a range of materials from public officials or on the Internet. 

In conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reason, they can take various steps to understand and appreciate their valuable and precious assets.",6.0,"**Feedback:**

**Task Response:**  
Your essay addresses the task by exploring the reasons why people might be interested in the history of their homes or buildings, along with strategies for researching this history. You have effectively highlighted why buildings are considered important for both financial and historical reasons. The reasoning is developed with some good examples, but the essay could benefit from further elaboration on each point for a fuller exploration. Additionally, your conclusion could be extended to summarize your key points more explicitly.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**  
The essay is generally coherent and follows a logical structure – an introduction, followed by arguments and examples, and ending with a conclusion. However, there are moments where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For instance, between describing reasons and suggesting methods, you might use more explicit linking phrases to guide the reader through the text (""Additionally,"" ""Moreover,"" ""Furthermore,"" etc.). Your paragraphing is appropriate, with each paragraph focused on a single core idea.

**Lexical Resource:**  
The range of vocabulary used is commendable, and you have appropriately used some sophisticated terms (""real estate property,"" ""design paradigm,"" ""document specifying details""). However, there are occasional inaccuracies in word choice and some awkward phrasing. For instance, ""realize the historical value"" might be better phrased as ""recognize the historical significance.""

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**  
Your essay demonstrates a good range of grammatical structures, with many complex sentences used appropriately. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward constructions that detract slightly from the clarity of your argument. For example, ""search for a copy of a house deed, which is a document specifying details of a certain house"" could be simplified and streamlined. There are also minor issues with article usage and verb forms (e.g., ""it is a also pretty efficient way"" should be ""it is also a pretty efficient way"").

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**  
- Provide more detailed examples and explanations for each reason to strengthen your argumentation.
- Improve the flow between sections by using more linking words and phrases.
- Pay attention to word choice and phrase construction to increase clarity and precision.
- Aim for greater grammatical accuracy, ensuring each sentence is correctly structured.

**Overall Summary:**  
This is a well-structured essay that addresses the prompt effectively. Your arguments are relevant, and there is an attempt to support your points with examples. Cohesion could be improved with smoother transitions, and while vocabulary use is varied, precision could be enhanced with careful attention to word choice. The grammatical structures are varied but would benefit from more accuracy. Overall, this is a strong response, which could be improved further by focusing on clarity and depth.","**Rating: 4**

"Prompt: The best way to solve the world's environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Essay: In recent years, there has been a debate on whether the expense of fuel for cars and other vehicles should be raised in order to address environmental issues. Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.

First of all, the act of increasing the price of vehicles’ fuel in order to tackle environmental problems is generally ineffective and unwise. Even if the cost of gas were to experience considerable growth, it is unlikely that the demand for private vehicles will alleviate. One explanation can be given is that people have become over-reliant on private transportations. Most of them find it significantly more comfortable and convenient to travel by cars or motorbikes in comparison to using public transportations such as buses or trains. As such, the constant need for automobiles, as well as the hazardous environmental impacts originating from this demand, are still apparent despite the soaring gas prices.

Furthermore, if the value of gas is remarkably elevated, there are a number of outcomes that are guaranteed to be financially unfavourable for the economy. It should be taken into consideration that fossil fuel is essential to many industries that provide necessary goods for people. So as a consequence, when the cost of fuel rises, the price of daily commodities will witness an increase as well. This phenomenon will directly produce a predicament for developing countries that are already in deficiency of goods such as food. When products' prices skyrocketed, the citizens from those countries will find themselves unable to afford daily items, leaving them to face incredible hardships and difficulties.

In conclusion, I disagree with the view that elevating the cost of fuel is the most practical way to deal with environmental issues. This is due to the fact that not only this proposal proves to be inefficacious, but it also can be disastrous for poorer countries' economies and citizens.",8.5,"**Task Response: Band 7**
Your essay appropriately addresses the main parts of the prompt by arguing against the view that increasing fuel prices is the best way to solve environmental problems. You have presented a clear position and developed relevant arguments to support your view. However, providing more specific examples or alternative solutions could further strengthen your argument. Your conclusion effectively summarizes your position.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7**
Your essay is generally well-organized with a clear progression of ideas. Each paragraph focuses on a central topic, and you have used signposting phrases such as ""First of all"" and ""Furthermore"" to guide the reader through your argument. However, the use of linking words and phrases could be further diversified to improve fluency. Overall, paragraphing effectively supports coherence, although transitions between ideas within paragraphs could be smoother.

**Lexical Resource: Band 7**
You have demonstrated a good range of vocabulary, using words like ""elevated,"" ""reliant,"" and ""phenomenon"" appropriately. There is evidence of your ability to use less common language items flexibly. However, be mindful of minor inaccuracies, such as ""transportations"" instead of ""transport."" The misuse of singular and plural forms, like ""transportations"" and ""products' prices,"" slightly affects the clarity.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 7**
You have shown a good command of a variety of sentence structures, including complex ones. Errors are infrequent and do not obscure meaning, although there is room for improvement in punctuation, for instance, in ""commodities will witness an increase as well"" where a comma could improve readability. Watch for minor subject-verb agreement issues, such as ""transportations such as buses"" which would be smoother as ""transportation such as buses.""

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**
1. Provide specific examples or alternative strategies for tackling environmental issues to strengthen your argument.
2. Diversify your use of linking words and phrases to enhance coherence and fluency within paragraphs.
3. Ensure accurate use of vocabulary by revisiting the singular and plural forms of words.
4. Maintain careful attention to punctuation for improved clarity and readability.

**Overall Summary:**
Your essay is effectively organized and presents a clear argument with relevant ideas, although specific examples and alternative solutions would further bolster your position. Your use of a strong lexical range and grammatical structures is commendable, but maintaining accuracy and coherence will enhance the overall quality.

"Prompt: Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?
Essay: While it is true that in many nations of people have lots of engaged in travelling, because it has become a major part in their life. At present, more and more individuals liking travel from one place to another place than last few decades. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon. I deem that travelling has enough of advantages for the holiday makers. I will discuss the certain reasons and some advantages of travelling in the below paragraphs.

To start with there are two major factors which help to explain ideas why travelling is becoming more popular than in the past time. First reason is that people know very well, in the before time people had less interest in travelling, as they most liked to earn the money for fulfilling the needs of their family members. Because of this they had to work hard around the clock. Owing to this circumstance, they had no time for travelling. However, now the trend of this has varied in many ways. Technology has become faster, convenient, easier with the advents of current features. Namely transportation, which saves the time of the people. Nevertheless, people love travelling. Secondly, it has become enjoyable for their travellers. To illustrate, even if a person working in a big company at present. He or she gets promotions from their companies in order to go one place to another place either seven or a month with family, which the way of the this is an affordable. On the contrary side, it is impossible last few decades. Due to, people tend to travel in their life.

In spite of the causes, there are more advantages of departing for the passengers. First and foremost benefit is that it helps to provide the opportunity to make new friends. For instance, when a person moves to another country in life. As a result, he or she meets new friends, who belong to other traditions. From those  people he gets a chance to see their culture, conventional items of their country, lifestyles, foods and many more. In addition to it, travellers get an opportunity to have a national identity of their country, where they are able to live for a long time as well as learn about languages, which helps to stay connected with other people. It uses to enhance the in depth of knowledge for the layman.

"Prompt: Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business.  Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Essay: It is believed that climate change can cause negative effect on business in some ways while others think that there are some benefits for business. This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.
	On the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.
	On the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.

Your essay adequately addresses the main parts of the prompt, presenting two viewpoints on the potential impacts of climate change on business. While you provide some examples and arguments, there is a slight imbalance in how these arguments are developed.

"Prompt: As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who cannot afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Essay: Housing, being a fundamental need for individuals, has sparked debates about whether the government should offer it freely for those who are economically disadvantaged. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment.

I approve of the notion that free housing can lead to enhanced societal stability, which subsequently fosters national progress. In many societies, homelessness and housing insecurities plague the population, causing ripples of discontent and disenfranchisement. Ensuring everyone has shelter, a direct impact would be a reduction in street crimes, as desperation often drives people to unlawful acts. For instance, countries with robust social housing programs, like Denmark, report lower rates of vagrancy-related crimes. Additionally, a stable living situation can enhance individuals' mental and emotional well-being, leading to more productive and content citizens. As more people become productive, it contributes to the broader development and prosperity of a nation.

I concur that providing free housing can also result in a boost to economic mobility, paving the way for a more equitable society. When people aren’t burdened by exorbitant rents or the threat of eviction, they can allocate resources to education and skill development. This alignment of priorities leads to a more skilled workforce. For example, in nations where housing is heavily subsidized, such as in certain Nordic countries, there is a higher percentage of the population pursuing higher education and vocational training. As these individuals climb the socioeconomic ladder due to their enhanced skills, it reduces wealth disparities and fosters a more harmonious and balanced society. 

On the other hand, I disagree with the proposition solely due to the potential strain on governmental budgets, eventually resulting in the potential neglect of other critical sectors. Allocating funds for universal free housing would undoubtedly divert financial investments in other sectors like healthcare, education, or infrastructure. For instance, countries that have attempted large-scale free housing projects, such as Venezuela, faced challenges in managing their budgets, leading to economic downturns. This financial strain can culminate in inadequate facilities, poorer healthcare systems, and compromised educational quality. The eventual outcome might be a society where housing is free, but other basic necessities and quality services become scarce or subpar.

To sum up, while the merits of offering free housing are significant in fostering societal and economic growth, it is paramount to weigh these benefits against the potential strains on a nation's resources.",5.0,"**Task Response: Band 8**

Your essay presents a clear position with well-developed arguments on both sides of the debate regarding free housing. You thoroughly explore the societal benefits of government-provided housing, while also addressing potential budgetary constraints. The essay aligns well with the task, providing relevant examples and arguments. However, the conclusion could be more conclusive by clearly stating to what extent you agree or disagree with the proposition, thus fully addressing the prompt.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8**

The overall coherence and cohesion of your essay are strong, as the ideas flow logically from one point to the next, making the writing easy to follow. You have used cohesive devices effectively, connecting your arguments smoothly. However, the transition to the opposing viewpoint could be improved by using a clearer transitional phrase or sentence to demonstrate the shift in perspective.

**Lexical Resource: Band 8**

Your essay demonstrates a wide range of vocabulary used with fluency and flexibility. Terms such as ""societal stability,"" ""economic mobility,"" and ""equitable society"" are used accurately, contributing to the essay’s sophistication. There are only occasional lapses, such as the phrase ""Ensuring everyone has shelter, a direct impact would be..."" which could be smoother, but these do not detract from overall clarity.

"Prompt: Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.
Essay: In recent times, it's very important to recycle things like a plastic and glass and reduce the waste of it by teaching children. However, It's a highly debated topic, Some believe that it should be taught by schools and others think that it might be more effective if learn at home by parents. This essay will discuss both points of views further. I firmly believe that, Children should be aware and learn about this at the institution.

On the one hand, some group of people agrees that like other learnings, the value of recycled material and rubbish should teach at the house. In light of the fact that, Child always learns anything first at home to other places. For instance, one research held by the World Health Organisation in 1998 resulted, babies are adopting habits such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. From their parents and guardians while spending time with them. Therefore, they argue that home is a good place to learn about recycling things and waste.

On the other hand, I would stand by the former view that an institution is a more effective place for aware children to grasp habits of reuse the things. Firstly, It's well established fact that, students more listen to their teachers to parents. Secondly, They can learn from other peers by watching them. Last but not the least, If schools provide learning through practical examples, then children can more retain information for a long time. For example, One recent European study demonstrates that, Learning at school is far more impactful than home.

To conclude, People may vary in their opinion, I strongly believe that learning about reducing a waste and recycling a rubbish to children in schools are a more efficient way to home.",9.0,"**Task Response: Band 6**

"Prompt: In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools

 or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?
Essay: It is believed by some that sending youngsters to single-sex schools can bring many disadvantages later in life. Meanwhile, many parents choose to send their offspring to these schools because they think that it is more beneficial to them. In my opinion, this can have many negatives. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.

To begin with, sending children to single-sex schools can make it hard for them to learn how to interact and cope with the opposite sex . To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that spending time with kids of the opposite sex is essential and can facilitate the development of youngsters' communication skills. Moreover, they can learn how to interact and be members of one group and work as a team. Therefore, sending offspring to a single-sex school can make it harder for them to cope with children from the opposite sex. 

Lastly, if young boys go to a different school than young girls, then the quality of their social life in the future can be damaged. For instance, scholars reckon that when kids from both genders go to the same school and spend time together, they can learn about their differences and cope with them. As a consequence, they are more likely to have a successful marriage and it will be easier for them to find friends from the opposite sex when they are adults. This shows that there are many benefits to encouraging boys and girls to interact with each other. Thus, sending our offspring to schools that accept both genders will be more beneficial to them and their social lives. 

To conclude, it is reckoned by some that sending kids to schools that accept only boys or girls can cause issues for them later in life. In my view, this statement is completely true. Given the current circumstances, it is best to encourage kids from both genders to interact with each other more often.",8.0,"**Task Response:** 

The essay successfully addresses the prompt, discussing the potential disadvantages of single-sex schooling and presenting a clear position that such schooling can have negative effects on children's social skills and future relationships. The response is sufficiently developed with relevant examples and explanations, which help to support the main argument. However, it could benefit from considering possible counterarguments to provide a more balanced discussion, thus strengthening the overall argument.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay is generally well-organized, and ideas are presented in a logical order. The use of linking words, such as ""to begin with,"" ""moreover,"" ""therefore,"" and ""lastly,"" helps guide the reader through the argument. However, some sentences could be more tightly linked to enhance cohesion. For example, instead of starting a paragraph with ""Lastly,"" consider using a more substantive transition that directly ties the upcoming paragraph to earlier ideas. Additionally, improve the transition between individual sentences within paragraphs to maintain the flow of ideas.

**Lexical Resource:**

The vocabulary used is appropriate and sufficient for the task. The writer demonstrates the ability to use some less common expressions, such as ""offspring"" and ""reckon,"" though it's worth mentioning that ""offspring"" can sound scientific in certain contexts, so using ""children"" might fit better in a general context. Additionally, varying vocabulary more extensively could help make the essay more engaging. The overall word choice is adequate, with only minor issues affecting stylistic appropriateness or repetition.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The essay demonstrates a good range of sentence structures, from simple to complex, with generally accurate grammar and punctuation. A few sentences could be restructured for clarity and precision. For instance, the phrase ""if young boys go to a different school than young girls"" could be improved for coherence, such as ""if young boys and girls attend separate schools."" While errors are minimal, aim for greater sentence variety and ensure complete understanding by refining any awkward phrasing.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Consider addressing potential counterarguments to your position to provide a more balanced view and strengthen your overall discussion.
2. Use more varied vocabulary to enrich your lexical resource and engage readers.
3. Enhance cohesion by using more substantive transitions between paragraphs and sentences.
4. While your grammatical range is generally good, continue practicing to minimize minor errors and refine sentence clarity.

**Overall Summary:**

The essay effectively addresses the task prompt with an organized and coherent discussion. The arguments are relevant and adequately supported, albeit lacking a counterargument consideration. With some improvements in the areas of vocabulary diversification, transition use, and counterargument inclusion, the essay could achieve a higher band score. Well done, and keep practicing to further refine your writing skills.","Rating: 4 (Very Good)

"Prompt: More and more people these days work harder and longer hours and have no time for family life and friends. What are the causes in your opinion for this? How is it affecting family life and the society as a whole?
Essay: It is true that people have increasingly put in extra hours at work and therefore had little time for their families and friends in recent years. This essay will discuss the possible causes in my perspective for this growing trend and also suggests the possible consequences that may result in both personal life and  society.

There are several causes for people working harder and longer hours in today's world. First, since the world's population is still increasing in huge annual increments, at around 80 million per year, with scarce resources and opportunities, people are having to contend with each other harder than ever before, especially in densely populated areas. This means that if a person doesn't work diligently, he or she will be susceptible to unemployment and not be able to feed his or her family.Second, spending more time working can offer a number of benefits to workers in the company. For example, by leaning into a frenzy in the workplace, a worker can be viewed as productive or being sought after, creating a sense of status for him or her.

Consequently, the trend can affect individuals and  society to a certain extent. Being overly concerned about work can impair other important aspects of life, including relationships with family members. For instance, some successful managers have divorced many times or have not been able to watch their children grow since they don't spend time with their families. In addition, spending too much time in the performance zone could give rise to various mental health problems, such as burnout or stress, leading to productivity loss as a result. Recent research and studies conducted have indicated that productivity decreases for employees who work more than fifty hours per week because of inadequate recovery time.

In short, I believe that overpopulation and self-recognition have caused employees to spend longer hours in the workplace and neglect family relationships. This may result in burnout and stress, leading to reduced productivity and spoiling family relationships.",6.5,"**Task Response: Band 7**
The essay adequately addresses the prompt by discussing causes and effects of longer working hours on family and society. The response is clear and well-developed, but could benefit from more examples or evidence to further enhance the argument. Additionally, the causes and consequences are somewhat overgeneralized and lack precision at times. The position is clear throughout, and the essay ends with a relevant conclusion.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7**
Overall, the essay is logically organized, with a clear progression of ideas from causes to effects. Cohesive devices are used correctly, such as ""First,"" ""Second,"" and ""Consequently,"" to guide the reader. However, some sentences could be more fluently linked to enhance readability. Transitions between certain sections could be smoother, and paragraphing could be improved for better structure.

**Lexical Resource: Band 7**
The range of vocabulary used is sufficient, with some attempt to use less common expressions (""leaning into a frenzy,"" ""performance zone""), which demonstrates some flexibility. However, there are minor inaccuracies in word choice and expression, such as ""being sought after, creating a sense of status"" which could be more precisely articulated. More diverse vocabulary around the topic may help to push the lexical resource further.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 7**
The essay includes a variety of sentence structures, most of which are accurate. There are occasional errors, such as missing spaces after periods and some awkward phrasing which slightly impede clarity, such as ""Recent research and studies conducted have indicated."" These could be refined to enhance the grammatical range and accuracy. Nevertheless, most sentences are error-free and punctuation is generally well managed.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Task Response:**
   - Incorporate more precise examples to support your arguments. For instance, provide specific details about how certain industries demand longer hours.
   - Avoid overgeneralizing by exploring different perspectives or dimensions of the issue, such as cultural factors or economic pressures.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - Work on varying your use of cohesive devices to ensure more fluid transitions between ideas.
   - Consider reorganizing paragraphs for better clarity and focus. Each paragraph could revolve around a specific cause or effect with supporting details.

3. **Lexical Resources:**
   - Expand your vocabulary by incorporating synonyms and varied expressions related to work-life balance, stress, and family dynamics for greater lexical diversity.
   - Pay attention to precise word choice to convey intended meanings more effectively.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
   - Review your essay for minor grammatical mistakes, such as run-on sentences or improperly spaced punctuation, to enhance clarity.
   - Consider refining complex structures for accuracy and ease of understanding.

**Overall Summary:**
The essay effectively addresses the task, providing a well-structured discussion on both the causes and impacts of longer working hours. While coherent and logical, there is room to enrich the detail and fluency of the response. With improved examples, a more varied vocabulary, and refined grammar, this essay could achieve a higher band score. Keep practicing these elements to enhance your overall writing skills.","Rating: 5

Families have a direct impact on children. First of all, children grow up at home with their parents at least 15 years old and they repeat the behaviour of their parents. And also, children’s personalities are formed at home. Children do not have much access to new technology in their early years. If parents make time for children and love them, kids run towards them.

**Task Response: Band 5**

Your essay attempts to address the prompt by presenting a viewpoint on the role of families versus outside influences in child development. There is a discernible position that families have a direct impact on children, and the essay tries to support this stance. However, your argument lacks clarity and depth. The discussion on how external factors might have a larger influence is not thoroughly explored, and there is some repetition and lack of sufficient development in your ideas.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 5**

The overall organisation of the essay can be followed, but it suffers from a lack of logical progression and fluency. The introduction is vague and does not clearly state your position. Transition between ideas and paragraphs could be smoother. Basic cohesive devices are used, but sentences do not consistently connect well. For example, the use of ""in conclusion"" does not feel aligned with all the points made, as the contrasts and discussions are not completely thorough.

**Lexical Resource: Band 5**

The vocabulary range is limited and there is not much variation in expression. Simple vocabulary is used accurately, but errors such as ""which idea can more correct"" show inaccurate usage. There are also issues with using conjunctions like ""but"" as a cohesive device (""despite the technology, but families...""). While the meaning is mostly clear, the limited vocabulary restricts the flexibility to convey precise meanings.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 4**

The essay consists mainly of simple sentence structures, and attempts at complex sentences tend to be faulty or awkward (e.g., ""through outside factors can affect on them""). There are grammatical errors that occur frequently, such as incorrect preposition use (""impact on them""), wrong pronoun use (""her or his""), and faulty use of conjunctions (""Because, technology...""). These errors affect the overall readability and understanding of your argument.

1. **Task Response:** Expand your support for both sides of the argument. Provide more examples and evidence to strengthen your position and enhance your exploration of external factors.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:** Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and develops logically. Use transition words to link ideas within and between paragraphs more effectively.

3. **Lexical Resource:** Work on expanding your vocabulary to explain ideas with more precision. Practice using synonyms and expressions to avoid repetition and to enhance clarity.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Focus on structuring sentences correctly, practicing both simple and complex forms. Pay careful attention to grammar rules regarding sentence structure, prepositions, clauses, and punctuation.

Your essay partially addresses the question; however, it lacks clarity and depth in your arguments. While you mention that you agree with the prompt, you do not clearly present your position or the extent of your agreement. Furthermore, your response lacks a comprehensive examination of how these activities can benefit teenagers and the community. The essay is incomplete, and there is no evident conclusion or adequate development of ideas. There are limited examples or reasons provided to support your agreement.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 4**

The essay shows some effort in organizing ideas, but the structure is not clear or well-developed, causing difficulty in following your argument.

Your vocabulary is basic and often incorrectly used. There are multiple spelling mistakes such as ""juvienile"" (juvenile), ""lessure"" (leisure), ""im"" (I'm), ""chilldren"" (children). Additionally, the use of words like ""volunter"" (volunteer) and ""ethic"" (ethics or a related word possibly intended as 'people') is inaccurate. Your ability to convey precise meanings is limited by the lack of vocabulary variety and occasional misuse.

"Prompt: Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Essay: Nowadays, almost everyone can afford to join the internet from any point in the world. However, not every source of data is the truth, there is much disinformation by which ordinary people can be misguided. No doubt that the power of control over informational recourse should be and depends on its spreading and influence on people. 

Firstly, there are many online forums, courses and conferences during which person can catch wrong ideas or be deceived by following the pieces of advice that dominate there. For instance, in Russia many poor or even rich people buy various guides in order to be on the lap of luxury. At last, people lose their invested finance, which fluctuate between 1 thousand and several million rubles, time and sometimes even health and accommodation because of the loan on study. 

Secondly, such examples show the significance of informational regulation from the government. It can be implemented by installing some restrictions through internet providers, with legal responsibility for disobeying. To demonstrate, in China the external and internal web is filtered, all messengers, content platforms are banned or under control from special structures. Therefore, it prevents misleading news and other provocative material from becoming popular. 

Taking everything into account, at modern time information around us will be coming more and more available, bringing about the increasing probability to be misguided or deceived by fake news. Nevertheless, local authorities are to control and limit access to the doubtful, risky data, thereby putting a stop for misinformation between citizens.",4.0,"**Task Response: Band 4**
The essay tangentially addresses the topic. Although the initial instruction focuses on whether only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities, the essay extensively diverts to discussing misinformation and the role of government in controlling information on the internet. A position is somewhat discernible regarding the control of information by the government, but the reader needs to extrapolate the underlying argument to grasp it. The essay fails to address the assigned task directly concerning housing shortages, and the ideas presented lack relevance to the question.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 4**
The essay presents information and ideas but lacks coherence with respect to the task. There is minimal logical organisation or progression as the response is focused on another topic. Cohesive devices, such as linking words and phrases, are used inaccurately, often failing to substantively connect ideas within the context of the prompt. Paragraphing exists but does not serve to enhance the argument related to the assigned task.

**Lexical Resource: Band 5**
The essay demonstrates a limited yet minimally adequate range of vocabulary. While some sophisticated words are used, they are not always applied accurately or effectively within the topic's context. There are repeated terms and phrases, which contribute to wordiness without adding clarity or depth. Some spelling and word formation errors can be seen but do not entirely obscure communication.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 5**
The grammatical range is limited and somewhat repetitive. There are attempts at both simple and complex sentences, although errors are frequent—affecting the fluidity and clarity of the response. Punctuation errors and unclear sentence structures occasionally hinder understanding.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**
1. **Relevance to Task**: Directly address the topic—housing shortages in big cities and the role of government action. Ensure every argument presented ties back to the core question.
   
2. **Structure**: Organise the essay to follow a logical progression of ideas. Begin with an introduction that outlines your stance, followed by body paragraphs each supporting your position with clear, relevant points, and conclude with a summarisation of the discussion.

3. **Cohesion and Coherence**: Improve the use of cohesive devices to ensure smooth transitions and logical flow of ideas. Clearly connect each paragraph to the main argument by explicitly relating it to the topic.

4. **Grammar and Vocabulary**: Work on diversifying vocabulary specific to the task's topic without repetition. Ensure grammatical structures are varied, accurate, and clear to enhance readability.

5. **Task Response**: Develop your argument with relevant examples related to housing issues and government action. This could include case studies of urban planning, governmental housing policies, or economic measures.

**Overall Summary:**
The essay significantly deviates from the intended topic and should focus on directly responding to whether only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. By refining the task response, coherence, lexical resource, and grammar, the essay can effectively and clearly express ideas pertinent to the assigned question. Consider re-evaluating examples and arguments to thoroughly support your stance on housing shortages rather than general government control over information.","**Feedback Evaluation: 5 (Excellent)**

"Prompt: In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?
Essay: Historical literature has been gaining attention in many societies. Though in some regions, there is a growing number of individuals who are becoming curious about knowing about the history of the place where they live. People want to reach some goals by doing this, however, this is a hard task to achieve. 

There may be several reasons why someone should explore the past years of their house. Firstly, it has been considered leisure for many individuals, especially in the UK. For example, those who live in an old building that has been refurbished  a number of times are the most interested in learning about its past. More importantly, some old houses that once have been hosting a famous author or a public figure could get the public attention, so they can become a source of income for the owner. Likewise, homes that well-known barons and saints had been living there a long time before until they have died, so they attract a few visitors these days.

As for the ways that someone could find out about the history of a place, there are only a few resources available. One way is to seek out the remaining documents regarding the information related to that place. For instance, archived newspapers and phonebooks that may be still present in some libraries. Besides, trying to directly ask the prior owners about their ancestors to find out who was the first owner. Such as looking at families' old pictures and their possible documents.

In summary, the curiosity of people and seeing the history of their house as a leisure activity are the main reasons why someone may seek the past of their living area. Although it is quite hard to achieve, there are a few resources available in the libraries, which could help them to pursue their aim.",4.5,"**Task Response: Band 6**

The essay generally addresses the question and provides some valid reasons why people might be interested in the history of their homes. However, the essay could be improved by:

1. More clearly structuring and linking the different parts of the essay. Currently, the introduction does not clearly lay out the structure or purpose of the essay, potentially confusing the reader.
2. Adding more explanation and examples to support the main points, especially in the second paragraph, to strengthen the argument.
3. The conclusion could be more directly tied to the question and summarize the main points more effectively.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 6**

The essay demonstrates an attempt to organize ideas, but there are lapses in coherence and cohesion:

1. Transitions between ideas and paragraphs could be improved to help the essay flow more logically. For example, the transition from the reasons to how people research could be smoother.
2. Some sentences, especially in the second paragraph, are a bit disjointed and could use clearer connectors or more logical sequencing of information.

**Lexical Resource: Band 6**

The vocabulary used in the essay is generally appropriate but somewhat limited:

1. There is some repetition of phrases, which could be minimized by using synonyms or rephrasing.
2. Attempting to use more sophisticated vocabulary and idiomatic phrases could elevate the essay.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6**

The essay uses a mix of simple and complex structures, though there are grammatical inaccuracies that affect clarity:

1. There are several grammatical errors, such as tense consistency (e.g., ""once have been hosting"") and article use (""a few resources"").
2. Some sentence constructions are awkward and could be rephrased for clarity (e.g., ""homes that well-known barons and saints had been living there"").

**Overall Suggestions for Improvement:**

- Structure your essay more clearly at the beginning through a focused introduction.
- Develop each main point fully with explanations, examples, and supporting details.
- Work on using more varied and advanced vocabulary while ensuring words are used accurately.
- Pay attention to grammatical accuracy, especially in complex sentence structures.
- Use transitions effectively to link your ideas in a smooth, logical manner.

**Overall Summary:**

The essay provides a relevant response to the prompt, addressing why people might be interested in the history of their homes and how they can research this information. However, the development of ideas could be more thorough, and improvements in coherence, lexical resource, and grammatical accuracy are needed to achieve a higher band score. With more structured organization, refined vocabulary, and accurate grammar, the essay could be more compelling and clearly comprehensible.","**Evaluation: 5 (Excellent)**

Essay: some people believe that raising the price of fuel for all vehicles is the most effective way to tackle the current environmental crisis, although this will bring remarkable results, I suppose that there are many feasible measures that the government can impose.

On the one hand, increasing the price of fuel is a possible solution to the world's environmental issues, this is mainly because fuel-powered vehicles contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, the fact that the government increases the price of gas can lead to the residents reduce to use vehicles, this will cut down on greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. However, I hold the belief that a rise in fuel prices is likely to cause locals to become increasingly resentful of their government's policies, which could hamper them from adhering to the law of the state.

on the other hand, I do not believe that increasing the price of gas is the best way option, it is not a sustainable measure this is because that not sufficient to tackle those issues. In other words, the state should lay a solid foundation of education for inhabitants, For example, the state should encourage residents to use clean energy such as wind, solar, and nuclear, as those fuels will emit fewer greenhouse gases. there are several nations, in recent decades, that rely solely on such energy to sustain their economies. Consequently, those countries contribute to the mitigation of global warming and other ecosystem menaces.

In conclusion, I acknowledge that increasing the price of fuels will reduce emissions from vehicles to some extent, From my perspective, creating alternative energy, will be a sustainable solution, and this will upgrade the quality of the environment.",7.0,"**Task Response: Band 6**

The essay addresses the prompt by discussing the proposal to increase fuel prices as a means to solve environmental problems. The writer presents a position, indicating partial agreement with alternative solutions suggested. However, the response lacks thorough development and specificity in terms of supporting arguments. Several ideas are introduced but are not fully extended or supported, such as how education or the adoption of renewable energy would be practically implemented or incentivized. To improve, consider providing more specific evidence, examples, and clarity around the feasibility of alternative solutions.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 6**

The essay has a general structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, the connection between ideas within sentences and paragraphs is sometimes unclear due to overuse of commas where full stops or conjunctions would be more appropriate, leading to run-on sentences. Cohesive devices (like linking words) are used but could be managed more effectively to ensure fluid transitions between ideas. Clarify paragraph separation between different arguments and improve sentence structuring for smoother reading.

**Lexical Resource: Band 6**

The essay demonstrates adequate vocabulary relevant to the topic. However, there is room for greater lexical variety and precision. Certain phrases could be more appropriately formulated, and the essay contains occasional awkward word choices (e.g., ""hamper them from adhering to the law of the state,"" could be revised for clarity and conciseness). Enhance lexical resource by incorporating a broader range of vocabulary and refining word choice to better convey meaning.
