Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"I agree with both: many activities must be organise by parents as kids have not much knowledge about what to do sometimes.
Freedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.
Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.
Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...
Parents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...
At the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet.",5.0,8,"**Feedback on Student Essay**

1. **Task Response**:
   - While the essay attempts to discuss both views, the arguments are not well-developed or clearly articulated. The essay should more effectively compare the two perspectives—parent-organized versus child-chosen activities—with clear explanations and examples.
   - The introduction should clearly state the topic and indicate the structure of the discussion. Currently, the introductory statement is combined with a personal view, making it less effective in setting up the context.
   - To reach a higher task response score, provide balanced points for both sides and ensure the opinion is clearly stated in a separate conclusion.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**:
   - The essay lacks clear separation of ideas into paragraphs, which would greatly enhance the logical flow. It's crucial to use paragraphs to present each main point clearly.
   - Transitions between ideas are abrupt. Use linking words and phrases (e.g., “In contrast,” “Moreover,” “However”) to create smoother transitions between sentences and paragraphs.
   - Your opinion is intertwined with the discussion, making the essay’s structure less clear. Reserve your final stance for a concluding paragraph.

3. **Lexical Resource**:
   - There is some appropriate vocabulary related to the topic, but the range is limited, and there are frequent inaccuracies (e.g., ""children's"" instead of ""children"").
   - Introduce more varied vocabulary to express your ideas clearly. For instance, instead of “grown spoiled,” you could use “may become overly dependent or lack resilience.”
   - Spelling mistakes such as ""organise"" (which depends on whether you're following UK or US spelling) should be consistent and correct.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**:
   - The essay shows an attempt to use different tenses and sentence structures, but there are many grammatical errors that hinder comprehension. For example, “Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid…” mixes perspectives in one sentence.
   - Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence structure. For example, ""Children's should start to make mistake"" should be corrected to ""Children should start to make mistakes.""
   - Practice using complex sentence structures with correct punctuation to improve clarity and sophistication.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements**:
- Structure the essay with clear paragraphs: an introduction, body paragraphs for each viewpoint, and a conclusion.
- Use topic sentences to begin each paragraph and guide the reader through your argument.
- Develop each point with clear examples and explanations. For instance, when discussing safety, you might add specific activities that would require parental supervision versus those where children may have more freedom.
- Work on expanding your vocabulary by learning synonyms and practicing their use in context.
- Ensure that simple grammar rules, like subject-verb agreement and article usage, are consistently applied.

**Overall Summary**:
Your current essay score is a 5.0, with room for improvement primarily through better structure, more detailed content, and improved grammatical accuracy. Aim to clearly differentiate between organised and free-choice activities for children, supporting each point with specific examples or arguments. With focused practice on enhancing paragraph structure, transitioning smoothly between ideas, employing richer vocabulary, and reducing grammatical errors, you can work toward achieving your desired score of 8. Keep practicing your writing and seek feedback regularly to track and guide your progress."
Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of one international organization rather than the responsibility of each national government. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that one global institution should be responsible for environmental problems, while some people believe that each national government should take responsibility instead. While acknowledging the reasons for this proposal, I partly agree with it for several reasons. 

On the one hand, there are a lot of compelling reasons that environmental problems should be the duty of each national government. Initially, for artificial environmental problems, only the government could have the jurisdiction and capability to solve their own troubles. In fact, man-made environmental issues mostly might come from the big factories that could affect the economy of the country. It is the truth that one international organization could not have the authority to regulate these corporations and they might not grasp the complexities of the issues to deal with it in the best way. Therefore, the national government, who already understands the problems should take charge for their actions and solve their national artificial environmental problems since only them could possess adequate authority and could have the optimal strategy to address these issues in their own country.

On the other hand, in some emergency circumstances, such as natural disasters, the national government might find themselves lacking capability and resources to face it and in this case, one international organization should be in charge of these problems. It is obvious that, in the emergency circumstances such as sudden natural disasters, international organizations could provide money, food or even specialists in these fields. To be specific, since the global institution attracts a sum of power and experience from different countries around the world, they would have the ability to help these nations in a suitable way. For example, if a country  has to deal with a tidal wave for the first time and they have difficulties in dealing with it, the international organization could help them by combining the experience and knowledge from the previous disasters or they could gather the specialists in these problems to find an optimum choice for that nation. 

In conclusion, the division of responsibility is clear: national governments should address human-made environmental problems, while international organizations should take charge of natural disasters. This allocation of roles ensures a comprehensive and effective approach to addressing the diverse environmental challenges our world faces.",5.5,8,"**Feedback on Student Essay:**

**1. Task Response:**
- The essay addresses the prompt by presenting both sides of the argument regarding whether an international organization or individual national governments should handle environmental issues.
- The position is stated clearly at the beginning; however, the essay tends towards a balanced view rather than clearly agreeing or disagreeing with the prompt. In an essay requesting agreement or disagreement, it's important to take and sustain a definitive position.

There is no need to go out to see live performance (concert...) because it is better to see them on the TV or Computer screen. Do you agree or disagree,"An emerging trend that has generated a widespread phenomenon in the entertainment industry is watching movies at home.  Taking all the convenience into account, I am inclined to believe that watching movies on personal screens is much better than seeing the staged performances. Not only will watching movie at home help us to save our precious time, but it can also be a private area to enjoy TV series.

To look at the entertainment aspect, the most important factor to consider is the daily form of recreation. If a person is using some private applications, or browsing websites while relaxing against some pillows with the TV playing in the background, instead of uncomfortable going direct to the social cinema, it will be one of the best options for their budget. Such forms of entertainment, moreover, will create a private space for us to watch wonderful movies without irritating others intensely. Another point that needs to be taken into consideration is that the more people are around, the more bad emotional feelings we will get. Even though it is true that we always find confidence and truly happy whenever we can gather with friends or family members, which can be ruined while watching in the social cinema with strangers. In order to avoid this situation, all we need to do is be on our own, find a great Tv show and relax.

With that being said, however, everything always has its defective sides and it is pretty true on home-movie watching. What really makes the audience truly bored with the film is a distraction. For example, assuming a person is watching his favourite movie, he might be momentarily distracted by social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or even the notification of messages which is pretty unpleasant. Due to the fact that watching movies in our private area can affect negatively our routine, we might be immersed in blockbuster movies or Tv series and be lazy. In addition, the blue light of computer screens will cause some contemporary symptoms such as eye strain, blur vision or headache.

In conclusion, watching the movie is on the rise, and watching movies on computer trend brings both advantages and disadvantages to our self and the others. Moderation is the key to maintain balance and solve these problems effectively.",5.5,8,"**Task Response:**

Your essay presents an answer to the prompt but could be improved in several ways to achieve a higher score. Firstly, the topic is about live performances in general (e.g., concerts) but your essay mostly discusses movies and the comfort of watching them at home, which slightly diverges from the main focus. Ensure your arguments directly address the viewing of live performances on TV or computer screens versus attending them in person. Consider contributing more specific reasons and examples supporting why watching live performances on screens might be preferable.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

Your essay contains logical progression; however, ideas need clearer organization and connection. Your thesis is clear in the introduction but is not sufficiently connected to the rest of your essay. Each paragraph should clearly link back to your position stated in the introduction. Use clearer topic sentences and linking phrases to signal transitions and logical flow between ideas.

**Lexical Resource:**

While your vocabulary range is functional, expanding your use of less common and more precise vocabulary could enhance your score. For example, instead of ""movies"" in the context of live performances, you might want to discuss ""concerts"" or ""live theater."" Additionally, some word choices are slightly awkward, such as ""social cinema,"" which is not a common term in English.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The grammatical structures used are generally understandable, but there are moments of inaccuracy. For instance, ""Not only will watching movie at home help us to save"" should be corrected to ""Not only will watching movies at home help us save"" to ensure subject-verb agreement and parallelism. Revise your work for these types of errors, and try to incorporate a greater variety of sentence structures to showcase your abilities.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Refine Focus on the Prompt:** Shift the focus from movies to live performances, like concerts or plays, and explicitly compare attending these events to experiencing them through a screen.

2. **Enhance Argument Connection:** Strengthen the connection between your introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Ensure each paragraph clearly supports your main argument.

3. **Expand Vocabulary:** Implement a broader range of vocabulary, avoiding repetition and using precise and appropriate terms for the topic at hand.

4. **Improve Syntax and Grammar:** Focus on using complex sentences accurately and ensure subject-verb agreement and correct article usage throughout.

5. **Strong Paragraph Structure:** Develop clear topic sentences and use cohesive devices to better link your paragraphs and ideas. This will illustrate a more logical and seamless flow.

**Overall Summary:**

You've made a good attempt at your essay and have set out a structure that shows potential. By aligning your response more closely with the prompt, improving your vocabulary use, and refining grammatical accuracy, you'll be able to present a more substantive and sophisticated essay that could meet your desired score. Keep practicing and implementing these strategies, and your writing will continue to improve."
"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","It is indeed the fact that few cities across the globe experience the severe challenges of the high amount of traffic on their roads. This essay will discuss the potential reasons of this issue followed by the solutions to tackle them.

Firstly, the reason why some towns suffer from the increasing number of vehicles on the streets is no existence of a law related to driving restrictions. It means a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicle on a specific day or at a certain time does not exist which provides a liberty to drive anytime and anywhere. In addition, the inefficient public transport is the another major reason. It means that the distances across different destinations are not efficiently connected via public transport. As a result, people experience inconvenience while availing public transport to travel whereas opting to drive a private vehicle becomes a feasible option for them. For instance, due to the absense of direct connectivity of Delhi with Gurgaon, millions of employees residing in Delhi, drive to Gurgaon every day to work in their private vehicles which causes longer hours of traffic congestion at toll. 

However, the above-mentioned concerns are certainly be dealt by implementing the following methods. Firstly, public transporttransport can be improved which should connect all the major destinations in a city effectively and efficiently. This will definitely encourage commuters to shift to public transport which can increase their possibility of on-time arrival at their desired destination. Secondly, a law that prohibits people to drive their vehicles on roads, can be issued in which a driver must be penalized with the heavy challans upon violation. Consequently, the number of vehicle on the roads of a city will decline drastically. For instance, considering the concerning increment of vehicles on the roads of Delhi, the government implemented an even-odd rule which reduced a traffic by 40 to 45 per cent.

Consequently, although the increasing traffic in many cities is the result of the absence of required regulations and an effective public transportation, the improvement of the transportation system and implementing driving regulations can certainly address the issues.",5.0,8,"**Feedback for Improvement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","The prevalence of people searching for information about the history of the place where they are living is increasing. I believe there are several reasons and two main ways that help with research about it. 

 

The major cause is probably the satisfaction of people’s general curiosity, especially about the origin of their house or building, because for roughly two-thirds of the day they stay at home, so it is understandable if they want to know deeply about it. For example, they may want to know when it was constructed, who the former owners were, or what kind of materials were used for contracting. Furthermore, all this information may assist them in preparing a renovation plan for the future, such as which part of the house or building they should examine or the cost of the remodelling. That can make them feel more secure about their accommodation's condition. Finally, knowing about the history of their house or building may make them feel more appreciative of what they have, and in another situation, if they want to sell it, they can pass the information to the next owner because the purchaser might want to know. 

 

 

Turning to the ways to research information, first from the former owner or the landlord. For instance, if they just rent the accommodation, they can ask directly from the landlord. If they brought this place, they should get in touch with the person who was the former owner if they can get the address of her or his. The second way is by going to the local cadastral office. In this place, there will be employees working there to support the information fully. 

 

To summarize, the cause of this trend is primarily related to curiosity and the repair plan, and there are two ways to aid them: the landlord, the former owner, or the local cadastral office.",7.5,8,"**Feedback and Suggestions**

1. **Task Response:**
   - The essay addresses the prompt directly and provides an appropriate response to both parts of the question, outlining reasons for the interest in building histories and methods to research them. However, the ideas could be more fully developed and supported. For example, when talking about curiosity or renovation plans, including specific examples or testimonies from people can enhance the depth of your argument.
   - Suggestions: Expand on each reason and method with more specific examples or evidence. This can involve including statistics, historical evidence, or hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the importance of knowing a building's history.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - Your essay has a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Transitions between ideas and paragraphs are generally clear, but there is room to improve the fluidity between some sentences, particularly in the paragraph about researching methods.

For example, instead of ""first from the former owner,"" you could say ""one initial step is to contact the former owner.""

3. **Lexical Resource:**
   - The vocabulary used in your essay is appropriate and sufficiently varied for task 2 of the IELTS Writing exam. However, you could use more specific or less common words to express your ideas.
   - Suggestions: Strive to incorporate a wider range of vocabulary, including synonyms or idiomatic expressions where appropriate. Words like “contracting” could be replaced with “construction,” and “accommodation’s condition” could be phrased as “structural integrity.” Use language learning tools to regularly expand your vocabulary.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
   - Your essay demonstrates a good grasp of grammatical structures, with varied sentence forms. However, there are occasional errors in grammar or awkward phrases such as ""they can ask directly from the landlord."" Instead, ""they can directly ask the landlord"" would be more accurate.

People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages.,"Nowadays there is a trend that people start having babies when they have become older. Although there are benefits involved in this trend, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages.

On the one hand, parents who have babies in their thirties and forties are more mature. That is they have more experience in order to raise their children. For instance, they can provide children with pieces of advice about the major they should study and their career path. Moreover, older parents tend to have stable jobs, so they can support their children properly. For example, they are capable of sending their child to private schools. This in turn will cause  infants to have a better future when they become adults.

On the other hand, a huge age gap between parents and children may cause different issues. One problem could be difficulties in communication. Because these parents belong to a completely different generation, it would be hard for them to understand their children. Take a teenager who wants to dye his hair pink as an example; his old parents would be really angry as he cannot understand the current trend in fashion. Furthermore, since old parents are more likely to face numerous health problems, they do not have enough energy to spend with their family. This may cause their child faces various emotional issues.

In conclusion, old mothers and fathers can support their children when it comes to financial issues. However, due to the huge age difference, they cannot provide enough emotional support for their children. This makes the downsides far more important than the benefits.",7.0,8,"**Feedback**

"Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.
On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits",6.0,8,"**Feedback on Essay**

"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Nobody is a stranger to the fact that we live in a digital world. Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. 

There are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. 

Be that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. 

Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. 

At the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans. This will develop their societies in a much more sustainable way.",7.0,8,"**Feedback:**

released into the lakes and ocean have had considerably destructive impact on seas life, further it likely to have negative cause on food chain as well. for these reasons government should focus on environment and accommodation waste products.

On the other hand there are far more sources for expending harmful diseases which need to take in to account. Air pollution can lead to respiratory and breathing problems or in the worst condition it can provoke lung cancers. Pesticides and chemical fumes which emission into the open air are two main reason of dreadful sicknesses . for instance people whom live near facilities are suffering from dangerous bronchial problems . therefore it will be critical matters that need to find solution by governments.

"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","While the developed economy is believed as the sole solution for the alarming status of hunger and poverty. It is also considered as the main cause of environmental destruction. In this essay, both views will be discussed and from my perspective, I strongly agree with the former statement.

On one hand, economic growth enriches the budget for society. As a result, those unlucky people can give more support such as food or money. That helps them a lot in improving their daily life. In addition, developed economy has the high demand in the number of employees. In other words, providing a huge amount of jobs which would reduce the unemployment state. Thus, the poor now not only get job but also have chance to change their life.

On the other hand, increase in the number of factories is an evitable consequence of economic growth. That causes harm to the environment because factories are the main source of exhausted emission and other kinds of contaminated trash. Polluted air, water and soil are the outstanding examples for environmental damage by the factories. Moreover, to expand the industrial area aiming to serve the development of economy, forest will be destroy to make use of land. That leads to series of negative effects such as increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, green house effect,…

In conclusion, the developed economy brings both pros and cons. In details, the positive results in eliminating hunger and poverty. In contrast, negative consequences on the environment. However, I suppose we should take advantage of growth economic rather than reject it. Even we can apply it in protecting the environment.",5.5,8,"**Feedback and Suggestions**
