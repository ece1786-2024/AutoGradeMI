Below, you will find feedback categorized according to the assessment criteria, as well as suggestions for improving your writing:

1. **Task Response: Band 7**
   - You successfully address the main question and provide relevant reasons for why people are interested in the history of their houses, such as financial investment and safety concerns.
   - However, you tend to over-generalize and introduce ideas without sufficient precision, such as the link between climate change and the durability of house structures. Clarifying how climate change specifically affects building durability would enhance your argument. 
   - You might consider including specific examples or case studies to support your points further and enhance the depth of your response.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7**
   - The essay maintains a logical progression of ideas, and paragraphs are used effectively to organize your content.
   - While transitions between ideas are generally clear, some cohesive devices could be used more effectively to link ideas within paragraphs. For example, consider varying sentence structures to include conjunctions or phrases that create smoother transitions.
   - Revisiting the introduction for clarity could help set the stage for the argument; rephrase it to eliminate the vague term ""concerned"" and be more specific about how interest has risen.

3. **Lexical Resource: Band 7**
   - Your vocabulary is sufficiently varied to express the key ideas. However, minor improvements can be made to enhance precision and avoid repetitions, such as using synonyms or reformulating sentences.
   - There are some awkward expressions and word choices, such as ""precautious measures"" (consider ""precautionary measures"") and ""discover it"" (consider ""research it"" or ""investigate"").
   - Continue to expand your lexical range by using more sophisticated or technical terms when appropriate.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 7**
   - A good mix of simple and complex sentences is evident, though there are a few instances where grammar could be refined for clarity, such as ""such as murder or others"" (consider ""such as murder or other serious crimes"").
   - Pay attention to minor grammatical inaccuracies, for example, instead of ""bad reputation could drop the market value,"" use ""bad reputation could decrease the market value.""
   - Punctuation is generally well-handled, but take care to eliminate run-on sentences or fragments.
