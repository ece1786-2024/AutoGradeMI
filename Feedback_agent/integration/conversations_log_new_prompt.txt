#### Task Response
The essay effectively addresses the prompt, identifying reasons why people may be interested in the history of their residences and providing methods to research this information. However, the essay could benefit from expanding on the reasons and providing more detailed examples. Perhaps discuss other aspects such as cultural significance, architectural interest, or personal curiosity. 

#### Coherence and Cohesion
The overall structure is clear, with an introductory paragraph, separate sections for reasons and methods, and a conclusion. However, some sentences could be better connected to improve flow. Consider using transition words or phrases to make the essay more cohesive. For instance, phrases like "in addition," "furthermore," or "another reason could be" might help link ideas smoothly.

#### Lexical Resource
The essay demonstrates a reasonable range of vocabulary, though there are areas where word choice could be improved for precision and variety. Words like "precautious" should be replaced with "precautionary," and "notorieties" with "reputations" for clarity. Consider using synonyms or more varied expressions to avoid repetition and enhance the richness of the vocabulary.

#### Grammatical Range and Accuracy
The essay contains a mix of simple and complex sentence constructions, which is positive, but there are several grammatical inaccuracies. For example, "people are concerned to discover" should be "people are interested in discovering." The phrase "taking precautious measures" should be "taking precautionary measures." Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and the correct use of articles.

### Overall Suggestions and Improvements
1. **Expand on Reasons**: Add more depth to the reasons why people are interested in the history of their homes, such as personal safety concerns, historical interest, or neighborhood reputation.

### Overall Summary
This essay demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the topic, appropriately addressing both aspects of the prompt. While the organization of the essay is logical, there is room for developing more sophisticated arguments and examples. Increased attention to grammatical precision and lexical variety would greatly strengthen the essay, alongside improved coherence through transitional devices. With these enhancements, the essay would better meet the expectations of the IELTS writing task rubric.
