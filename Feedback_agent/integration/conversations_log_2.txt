**Task Response:** 
Your essay addresses the question, discussing both the reasons people are interested in the history of their homes and ways they might research this history. However, the reasoning could be expanded. While the essay does an adequate job of explaining why people might wish to investigate the history of their homes, discussing other reasons such as cultural or historical interest could add more depth. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more detail about the methods of research beyond a basic mention.

**Coherence and Cohesion:** 
Your ideas are mostly logically ordered and easy to follow. The reasons and methods are clearly separated into different paragraphs, which helps the reader understand your thoughts. However, further development within paragraphs would improve the flow and connection between sentences. Also, consider using more linking words and phrases to connect ideas smoothly. For example, words like "furthermore," "in addition," or "however" could link your ideas more cohesively.

**Lexical Resource:** 
Your essay demonstrates the use of appropriate vocabulary related to the topic, such as "investment," "notorieties," and "durability." You could aim to use a wider range of vocabulary to express more nuanced ideas about the topic. Some repetitions, such as "concerned" used twice in the introduction and second paragraph, could be replaced with synonyms for variety.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** 
The overall grammatical structure of your essay is good, with a variety of sentence types. There are some minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as "concerned to discover" which should be "concerned about discovering," and "precautious" which should be "precautionary." It would also be beneficial to review your plural forms and subject-verb agreement to avoid errors like "news related to the districts you live in" where "districts" should be singular if referring to one area.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Expand on Reasons:** Discuss more varied reasons beyond financing and durability. Consider cultural, historical, or even personal interest.
   
2. **Develop Ideas Further:** Provide more detail in each paragraph to better support your points, especially how people might carry out their research.

3. **Use more Connectors:** Enhance the coherence by using more linking words to connect ideas and sentences.

4. **Lexical Range:** Introduce more varied vocabulary to capture subtleties in meaning and avoid repetition.

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and ensure subject-verb agreement, as well as the correct use of plurals and adjectives.

**Overall Summary:**

Your essay provides a good foundation and addresses the basic aspects of the prompt. With a bit more development of ideas, the incorporation of additional linking words, and the introduction of a wider range of vocabulary, the essay's effectiveness would be greatly improved. Minor grammatical corrections will further enhance clarity and professionalism. Keep practicing to refine your writing and expand your argumentative skills.
