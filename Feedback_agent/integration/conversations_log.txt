### Task Response:
The essay successfully addresses the task by discussing reasons why people want to discover the history of their residence and suggesting methods for researching it. The main ideas are relevant and are generally well-explained. However, the essay could improve by including more specific examples or elaborating on the points made, particularly regarding diverse motives behind people's interest in the history of their homes. For instance, cultural or personal interest could be explored further.

### Coherence and Cohesion:
The essay is generally well-organized and follows a logical progression of ideas. The introduction clearly outlines the essay's intent, and the paragraphs each cover distinct aspects of the prompt. However, transitions between sentences and ideas could be more fluid. Using more transitional words and phrases could help guide the reader through the argument more smoothly. Additionally, consider introducing a concluding sentence for each paragraph to reinforce the main idea.

### Lexical Resource:
The vocabulary used is appropriate for the task and context, such as "notorieties," "investment," and "intrigued." Yet, there is room for improvement by incorporating a broader range of vocabulary. For instance, instead of "terrible notorieties," phrases like "notorious reputation" could be used for variety and precision. Similarly, some terms can be replaced or varied for greater lexical richness, like substituting "methods" with "approaches" or "strategies."

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
The essay demonstrates a reasonable range of grammatical structures with generally accurate use of language. However, there are minor errors, such as "precautious" which should be "precautionary," and some awkward phrasing, like "might be the causes and methods of how society." Efforts should be made to refine sentence structures and ensure subject-verb agreement and consistency in tense usage.

### Overall Suggestions and Improvements:
1. **Elaboration and Examples**: Adding more depth and examples for the reasons and methods could enhance the essay. Real-life examples or hypothetical scenarios might help illustrate points more effectively.
   
2. **Transition and Flow**: Work on improving transitions between paragraphs and within sentences to improve the flow and coherence of the essay. Words like "moreover," "in addition," or "similarly" might be useful.

3. **Lexical Variety**: Broaden the range of vocabulary used. Engage with synonyms for commonly used words to demonstrate a wider lexical resource.

4. **Grammar and Precision**: Pay close attention to grammatical errors and precision in language. A review of the sentence structure might be beneficial to ensure clarity and accuracy.

5. **Balance of Ideas**: While the essay is quite balanced, consider delving equally deep into personal or emotional motives as well as practical ones, to give a more comprehensive view.

### Overall Summary:
The essay effectively addresses the prompt and is well-structured; however, it could benefit from improved cohesion, enhanced vocabulary, and greater grammatical precision. By enriching the examples provided and refining the transitions, the overall quality of the essay could be elevated. With these focuses, the essay would likely receive a higher band score.
