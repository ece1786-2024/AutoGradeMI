"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In recent years, many people are concerned to discover the history of their residence. This essay will explore what might be the causes and methods of how  society can find out the information. 

The primary reason for exploring their residence is due to the huge investment in owning a property. Therefore, they are keen on taking precautious measures to secure their financing, which can be threatening if the property has terrible notorieties. For instance, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people fear such incidents will somehow happen in the future. This bad reputation could drop the market value of the place. Besides that, homeowners are more concerned about the durability of their house structures due to climate change that affects every continent in the world.

There are various methods to discover it. The first one is to find any news related to the districts you live in on the internet. Secondly, to interview local residents in the town as they have been living in a particular area for a long time, they must have heard many myths as well as experienced some by themselves. In this case, individuals can acquire first-hand evidence. Thirdly, paying a visit to the construction office as they can provide the details about materials to build the houses.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding

out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own

knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.","In the modern world, many people have increasingly paid attention to their houses or buildings, and they also make an effort to find a large amount of information about the house and building. In this essay, I discuss the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house and suggest a way to reach materials about them. 

I believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research a house or building. The most important one is that these days, a number of people consider their own houses or buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansions by making a sale or purchasing them, which means that they believe that their houses could be an effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their houses or buildings as products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize the historical value of their building where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get interested in gaining plenty of stories which the property contains, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. 

When it comes to people who want to know about their own house, they could utilize many ways to get useful knowledge. The simplest strategy is that just questioning  elder family members, and neighbours living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is a also pretty efficient way for people to search for a copy of a house deed, which is a document specifying details of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of their house or building, they would get a range of materials from public officials or on the Internet. 

In conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reason, they can take various steps to understand and appreciate their valuable and precious assets.",6.0,"## Task Response:

The best way to solve the world's environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, there has been a debate on whether the expense of fuel for cars and other vehicles should be raised in order to address environmental issues. Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.

First of all, the act of increasing the price of vehicles’ fuel in order to tackle environmental problems is generally ineffective and unwise. Even if the cost of gas were to experience considerable growth, it is unlikely that the demand for private vehicles will alleviate. One explanation can be given is that people have become over-reliant on private transportations. Most of them find it significantly more comfortable and convenient to travel by cars or motorbikes in comparison to using public transportations such as buses or trains. As such, the constant need for automobiles, as well as the hazardous environmental impacts originating from this demand, are still apparent despite the soaring gas prices.

Furthermore, if the value of gas is remarkably elevated, there are a number of outcomes that are guaranteed to be financially unfavourable for the economy. It should be taken into consideration that fossil fuel is essential to many industries that provide necessary goods for people. So as a consequence, when the cost of fuel rises, the price of daily commodities will witness an increase as well. This phenomenon will directly produce a predicament for developing countries that are already in deficiency of goods such as food. When products' prices skyrocketed, the citizens from those countries will find themselves unable to afford daily items, leaving them to face incredible hardships and difficulties.

In conclusion, I disagree with the view that elevating the cost of fuel is the most practical way to deal with environmental issues. This is due to the fact that not only this proposal proves to be inefficacious, but it also can be disastrous for poorer countries' economies and citizens.",8.5,"## Task Response:

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

At present, more and more individuals liking travel from one place to another place than last few decades. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon. I deem that travelling has enough of advantages for the holiday makers. I will discuss the certain reasons and some advantages of travelling in the below paragraphs.

To start with there are two major factors which help to explain ideas why travelling is becoming more popular than in the past time. First reason is that people know very well, in the before time people had less interest in travelling, as they most liked to earn the money for fulfilling the needs of their family members. Because of this they had to work hard around the clock. Owing to this circumstance, they had no time for travelling. However, now the trend of this has varied in many ways.

Secondly, it has become enjoyable for their travellers. To illustrate, even if a person working in a big company at present. He or she gets promotions from their companies in order to go one place to another place either seven or a month with family, which the way of the this is an affordable. On the contrary side, it is impossible last few decades. Due to, people tend to travel in their life.

In spite of the causes, there are more advantages of departing for the passengers. First and foremost benefit is that it helps to provide the opportunity to make new friends. For instance, when a person moves to another country in life. As a result, he or she meets new friends, who belong to other traditions. From those  people he gets a chance to see their culture, conventional items of their country, lifestyles, foods and many more. In addition to it, travellers get an opportunity to have a national identity of their country, where they are able to live for a long time as well as learn about languages, which helps to stay connected with other people. It uses to enhance the in depth of knowledge for the layman.

"As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who cannot afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Housing, being a fundamental need for individuals, has sparked debates about whether the government should offer it freely for those who are economically disadvantaged. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment.

I approve of the notion that free housing can lead to enhanced societal stability, which subsequently fosters national progress. In many societies, homelessness and housing insecurities plague the population, causing ripples of discontent and disenfranchisement. Ensuring everyone has shelter, a direct impact would be a reduction in street crimes, as desperation often drives people to unlawful acts. For instance, countries with robust social housing programs, like Denmark, report lower rates of vagrancy-related crimes. Additionally, a stable living situation can enhance individuals' mental and emotional well-being, leading to more productive and content citizens. As more people become productive, it contributes to the broader development and prosperity of a nation.

I concur that providing free housing can also result in a boost to economic mobility, paving the way for a more equitable society. When people aren’t burdened by exorbitant rents or the threat of eviction, they can allocate resources to education and skill development. This alignment of priorities leads to a more skilled workforce. For example, in nations where housing is heavily subsidized, such as in certain Nordic countries, there is a higher percentage of the population pursuing higher education and vocational training. As these individuals climb the socioeconomic ladder due to their enhanced skills, it reduces wealth disparities and fosters a more harmonious and balanced society. 

On the other hand, I disagree with the proposition solely due to the potential strain on governmental budgets, eventually resulting in the potential neglect of other critical sectors. Allocating funds for universal free housing would undoubtedly divert financial investments in other sectors like healthcare, education, or infrastructure. For instance, countries that have attempted large-scale free housing projects, such as Venezuela, faced challenges in managing their budgets, leading to economic downturns. This financial strain can culminate in inadequate facilities, poorer healthcare systems, and compromised educational quality. The eventual outcome might be a society where housing is free, but other basic necessities and quality services become scarce or subpar.

To sum up, while the merits of offering free housing are significant in fostering societal and economic growth, it is paramount to weigh these benefits against the potential strains on a nation's resources.",5.0,"## Task Response:

"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it's very important to recycle things like a plastic and glass and reduce the waste of it by teaching children. However, It's a highly debated topic, Some believe that it should be taught by schools and others think that it might be more effective if learn at home by parents. This essay will discuss both points of views further. I firmly believe that, Children should be aware and learn about this at the institution.

On the one hand, some group of people agrees that like other learnings, the value of recycled material and rubbish should teach at the house. In light of the fact that, Child always learns anything first at home to other places. For instance, one research held by the World Health Organisation in 1998 resulted, babies are adopting habits such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. From their parents and guardians while spending time with them. Therefore, they argue that home is a good place to learn about recycling things and waste.

On the other hand, I would stand by the former view that an institution is a more effective place for aware children to grasp habits of reuse the things. Firstly, It's well established fact that, students more listen to their teachers to parents. Secondly, They can learn from other peers by watching them. Last but not the least, If schools provide learning through practical examples, then children can more retain information for a long time. For example, One recent European study demonstrates that, Learning at school is far more impactful than home.

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools

 or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","It is believed by some that sending youngsters to single-sex schools can bring many disadvantages later in life. Meanwhile, many parents choose to send their offspring to these schools because they think that it is more beneficial to them. In my opinion, this can have many negatives. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.

To begin with, sending children to single-sex schools can make it hard for them to learn how to interact and cope with the opposite sex . To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that spending time with kids of the opposite sex is essential and can facilitate the development of youngsters' communication skills. Moreover, they can learn how to interact and be members of one group and work as a team. Therefore, sending offspring to a single-sex school can make it harder for them to cope with children from the opposite sex. 

Lastly, if young boys go to a different school than young girls, then the quality of their social life in the future can be damaged. For instance, scholars reckon that when kids from both genders go to the same school and spend time together, they can learn about their differences and cope with them. As a consequence, they are more likely to have a successful marriage and it will be easier for them to find friends from the opposite sex when they are adults. This shows that there are many benefits to encouraging boys and girls to interact with each other. Thus, sending our offspring to schools that accept both genders will be more beneficial to them and their social lives. 

To conclude, it is reckoned by some that sending kids to schools that accept only boys or girls can cause issues for them later in life. In my view, this statement is completely true. Given the current circumstances, it is best to encourage kids from both genders to interact with each other more often.",8.0,"## Task Response:

More and more people these days work harder and longer hours and have no time for family life and friends. What are the causes in your opinion for this? How is it affecting family life and the society as a whole?,"It is true that people have increasingly put in extra hours at work and therefore had little time for their families and friends in recent years. This essay will discuss the possible causes in my perspective for this growing trend and also suggests the possible consequences that may result in both personal life and  society.

There are several causes for people working harder and longer hours in today's world. First, since the world's population is still increasing in huge annual increments, at around 80 million per year, with scarce resources and opportunities, people are having to contend with each other harder than ever before, especially in densely populated areas. This means that if a person doesn't work diligently, he or she will be susceptible to unemployment and not be able to feed his or her family.Second, spending more time working can offer a number of benefits to workers in the company. For example, by leaning into a frenzy in the workplace, a worker can be viewed as productive or being sought after, creating a sense of status for him or her.

Consequently, the trend can affect individuals and  society to a certain extent. Being overly concerned about work can impair other important aspects of life, including relationships with family members. For instance, some successful managers have divorced many times or have not been able to watch their children grow since they don't spend time with their families. In addition, spending too much time in the performance zone could give rise to various mental health problems, such as burnout or stress, leading to productivity loss as a result. Recent research and studies conducted have indicated that productivity decreases for employees who work more than fifty hours per week because of inadequate recovery time.

In short, I believe that overpopulation and self-recognition have caused employees to spend longer hours in the workplace and neglect family relationships. This may result in burnout and stress, leading to reduced productivity and spoiling family relationships.",6.5,"## Task Response:
