"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In recent years, many people are concerned to discover the history of their residence. This essay will explore what might be the causes and methods of how  society can find out the information. 

The primary reason for exploring their residence is due to the huge investment in owning a property. Therefore, they are keen on taking precautious measures to secure their financing, which can be threatening if the property has terrible notorieties. For instance, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people fear such incidents will somehow happen in the future. This bad reputation could drop the market value of the place. Besides that, homeowners are more concerned about the durability of their house structures due to climate change that affects every continent in the world.

There are various methods to discover it. The first one is to find any news related to the districts you live in on the internet. Secondly, to interview local residents in the town as they have been living in a particular area for a long time, they must have heard many myths as well as experienced some by themselves. In this case, individuals can acquire first-hand evidence. Thirdly, paying a visit to the construction office as they can provide the details about materials to build the houses. 

In conclusion,  in many countries, people are more intrigued by the history of the places they intend to live in, for various reasons such as their families' safety and money investment. There are many approaches to find out how the houses are built: internet, local persons and offices.",8.5,"**Task Response:**
Your essay provides relevant content addressing the reasons people are interested in learning about the history of buildings and how they can research this information.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding

out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own

knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.","In the modern world, many people have increasingly paid attention to their houses or buildings, and they also make an effort to find a large amount of information about the house and building. In this essay, I discuss the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house and suggest a way to reach materials about them. 

I believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research a house or building. The most important one is that these days, a number of people consider their own houses or buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansions by making a sale or purchasing them, which means that they believe that their houses could be an effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their houses or buildings as products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize the historical value of their building where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get interested in gaining plenty of stories which the property contains, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. 

When it comes to people who want to know about their own house, they could utilize many ways to get useful knowledge. The simplest strategy is that just questioning  elder family members, and neighbours living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is a also pretty efficient way for people to search for a copy of a house deed, which is a document specifying details of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of their house or building, they would get a range of materials from public officials or on the Internet. 

In conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reason, they can take various steps to understand and appreciate their valuable and precious assets.",6.0,"**Task Response:** 

The essay effectively addresses the prompt by discussing reasons why individuals might be interested in uncovering the history of their homes or buildings, as well as methods to conduct such research. The reasons provided are relevant and logical, focusing on real estate investment and historical value. However, deeper exploration of each reason would strengthen the response. For instance, discussing how historical significance can increase the monetary or sentimental value of properties could add depth. Moreover, connecting each reason with personal insights or examples could provide more robust support. Overall, the task is appropriately addressed, though further development and specificity in the examples would be beneficial.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which aid in maintaining coherence. Transitioning phrases like ""the most important one is that"" and ""in addition"" help to logically connect ideas. However, the organization within the paragraphs could be enhanced. For instance, in the second body paragraph, separating the methods into distinct lines of reasoning might improve clarity. Better cohesion could also be achieved by ensuring that each paragraph has a single, clear central idea that is thoroughly explored. 

**Lexical Resource:**

The essay demonstrates a good range of vocabulary with precise use in many instances. Expressions such as ""transaction,"" ""investment,"" ""historical value,"" and ""critical role"" are used correctly and effectively. There is some awkwardness in phrasing, such as ""a now number of people consider,"" which should be revised to maintain fluency. While there is an attempt to use more advanced vocabulary, careful attention to word choice and collocation (i.e., the use of ""huge deal"" and ""understand and appreciate their valuable and precious assets"") would enhance the readability.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The response shows a variety of sentence structures, including complex sentences. There are occasional errors in grammar and phrasing, such as ""people have increasingly paid attention to their houses,"" which could be simplified for clarity, and ""it is a also pretty efficient way,"" which contains a typographical error (""a also""). Additionally, some sentences could benefit from being more direct to enhance understanding. Error-free sentences are frequent, but consistent grammatical control across more complex sentences would improve the score.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Develop Ideas Further:** Elucidate the provided reasoning by delving into more specific details or examples from personal experience or general knowledge.

2. **Improve Paragraph Structure:** Ensure that each paragraph maintains a single, clear focus. Consider breaking complex ideas into multiple paragraphs if necessary for greater clarity.

3. **Enhance Lexical Precision:** Use advanced vocabulary accurately, ensuring appropriate collocation and idiomatic expression. Revise awkward phrasing for smoother reading.

4. **Focus on Grammatical Accuracy:** Proofread for typographical errors and grammatical inconsistencies, especially in more complex sentences, to maintain clarity and coherence.

**Overall Summary:**

This essay effectively addresses the question, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. Improvements could be made by enhancing the depth of argumentation, refining the coherence and organization of ideas, diversifying vocabulary, and strengthening grammatical precision. With these enhancements, the essay would achieve a higher band score."
The best way to solve the world's environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, there has been a debate on whether the expense of fuel for cars and other vehicles should be raised in order to address environmental issues. Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.

First of all, the act of increasing the price of vehicles’ fuel in order to tackle environmental problems is generally ineffective and unwise. Even if the cost of gas were to experience considerable growth, it is unlikely that the demand for private vehicles will alleviate. One explanation can be given is that people have become over-reliant on private transportations. Most of them find it significantly more comfortable and convenient to travel by cars or motorbikes in comparison to using public transportations such as buses or trains. As such, the constant need for automobiles, as well as the hazardous environmental impacts originating from this demand, are still apparent despite the soaring gas prices.

Furthermore, if the value of gas is remarkably elevated, there are a number of outcomes that are guaranteed to be financially unfavourable for the economy. It should be taken into consideration that fossil fuel is essential to many industries that provide necessary goods for people. So as a consequence, when the cost of fuel rises, the price of daily commodities will witness an increase as well. This phenomenon will directly produce a predicament for developing countries that are already in deficiency of goods such as food. When products' prices skyrocketed, the citizens from those countries will find themselves unable to afford daily items, leaving them to face incredible hardships and difficulties.

In conclusion, I disagree with the view that elevating the cost of fuel is the most practical way to deal with environmental issues. This is due to the fact that not only this proposal proves to be inefficacious, but it also can be disastrous for poorer countries' economies and citizens.",8.5,"**Task Response**: 
The student has effectively addressed the task prompt by clearly stating a position of disagreement with the proposed solution of increasing fuel costs to solve environmental issues. The arguments are relevant, and the student provides justification for their stance using logical reasoning. The essay concludes with a reiteration of the main argument. However, more examples or evidence could strengthen the argument further.

There is a clear introduction and conclusion, which assist in framing the argument. Some paragraphs can benefit from additional topic sentences to guide the reader more effectively.

**Band 8**

**Lexical Resource**: 
The essay exhibits a good range of vocabulary that is used accurately. Phrases like ""over-reliant,"" ""hazardous environmental impacts,"" and ""financially unfavourable"" show an attempt to use more advanced vocabulary.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Houses are the place that people live which is meaningful for them. Some of the people take an interest on realize the story or history of the houses where people live in. In my opinion, there are some reasons for people to figure out the history of their home with some methods. 

     Most of human have a sense of belonging of where they are from or where they begin. Similar to people learning the history of hometown or country, people are curious about everything close to them. Due to houses are the place that people start up and come from, so people are willing to spend time on understanding the detail of their homes. To be more specific, it is common to see there were lots of impolite architects are building the house with shoddy work and use inferior materials. It actually affected a lot to safety of living which is pretty important to notice about. In order to have satisfying place to live, it is necessary for people to understand how the building comes from. 

To obtain the information about the house must ask someone who takes part in the manufacture of the house without doubt. While the house was building by parents or architect are the people who make lots of decision sand choices on the shape or elements of the house, no one is clear than they of this. If the house where people live in is a symbolic building of the city, it is easier to figure out the process and story of the building from public organization or websites on the internet. 

	Houses are meaningful for most of people. People are interested in the place that they lived in are normal phenomenon, some basic methods help them to understand the details of the building.",4.0,"**Task Response:**

The essay partially addresses the question by discussing possible reasons why people might want to learn about the history of their homes and presenting ways people can research this. However, the reasons provided are somewhat general and need further elaboration and examples. For instance, one might want to explore historical significance, architectural value, or personal family history related to the house. Additionally, the methods for research mentioned are limited and could be expanded to include more specific strategies, such as consulting local archives, using online databases, or joining community history groups. There should be a deeper exploration of these aspects to fully meet the task requirements.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The coherence and cohesion of the essay can be improved. The transition between sentences and ideas could be smoother, and some sentences disrupt the flow of the essay. For instance, ""Houses are the place that people live which is meaningful for them."" The connection between this sentence and the subsequent content is not very clear. Additionally, some conjunctions (such as ""due to"" or ""while"") are not used appropriately, which affects the logical progression of ideas. Each paragraph should have a clear central topic, and within paragraphs, sentences should be logically ordered for better flow.

**Lexical Resource:**

The vocabulary used is somewhat basic and repetitive. To enhance the essay, try using a wider range of vocabulary with more precise and varied expressions. For example, the term ""details of their homes"" could be substituted with specific aspects like ""architectural features,"" ""historical significance,"" or ""construction history."" Moreover, incorrect word choice such as ""impolite architects"" (which should likely be ""incompetent architects"") can lead to confusion. Explore synonyms, collocations, and more sophisticated phrases to improve expression.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

There are several grammatical errors that detract from the clarity and professionalism of the essay. For example, the sentence ""While the house was building by parents or architect are the people who make lots of decision sand choices on the shape or elements of the house, no one is clear than they of this"" is incorrect and confusing. Proper tense, word form, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure should be meticulously checked and revised. Additionally, punctuation errors abound, such as missing commas that affect comprehension.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Task Completion**: Ensure the reasons for the interest in house histories are more diverse and detailed, with illustrative examples where possible. Similarly, expand on various research methods.
2. **Structure**: Improve paragraph structure by maintaining a clear main idea for each paragraph and ensuring logical progression.
3. **Vocabulary**: Incorporate varied and precise vocabulary, considering the context of use, to convey information more effectively and avoid repetition.
4. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Pay careful attention to grammatical accuracy. This includes proper sentence structure, verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation use to enhance readability and professionalism.

**Overall Summary:**

The essay moderately covers the task but requires more extensive reasoning and exemplifications to fully engage with the topic. Coherence needs to be strengthened, particularly in paragraph structure and logical flow. A wider range of vocabulary and better grammatical accuracy will significantly improve the overall quality and communicative effectiveness of the essay. Implementing such strategies will better align the essay with higher band descriptors."
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"While it is true that in many nations of people have lots of engaged in travelling, because it has become a major part in their life. At present, more and more individuals liking travel from one place to another place than last few decades. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon. I deem that travelling has enough of advantages for the holiday makers. I will discuss the certain reasons and some advantages of travelling in the below paragraphs.

To start with there are two major factors which help to explain ideas why travelling is becoming more popular than in the past time. First reason is that people know very well, in the before time people had less interest in travelling, as they most liked to earn the money for fulfilling the needs of their family members. Because of this they had to work hard around the clock. Owing to this circumstance, they had no time for travelling. However, now the trend of this has varied in many ways. Technology has become faster, convenient, easier with the advents of current features. Namely transportation, which saves the time of the people. Nevertheless, people love travelling. Secondly, it has become enjoyable for their travellers. To illustrate, even if a person working in a big company at present. He or she gets promotions from their companies in order to go one place to another place either seven or a month with family, which the way of the this is an affordable. On the contrary side, it is impossible last few decades. Due to, people tend to travel in their life.

In spite of the causes, there are more advantages of departing for the passengers. First and foremost benefit is that it helps to provide the opportunity to make new friends. For instance, when a person moves to another country in life. As a result, he or she meets new friends, who belong to other traditions. From those  people he gets a chance to see their culture, conventional items of their country, lifestyles, foods and many more. In addition to it, travellers get an opportunity to have a national identity of their country, where they are able to live for a long time as well as learn about languages, which helps to stay connected with other people. It uses to enhance the in depth of knowledge for the layman.

To sum up, even though moving one region to another region has more reasons, yet while travelling has been many advantages for the trippers. I judge that it is playing a considerable role in everyone's life as well as very beneficial to increase the knowledge.",8.0,"The essay you have written seems to address a topic quite different from the question given. Instead of discussing the opinion on whether all jobs will eventually be done by artificially intelligent robots, your essay focuses mainly on the general benefits and reasons for travelling. Let's analyze the different criteria based on this discrepancy:

1. **Task Response**:
   - Unfortunately, the response does not address the prompt given. The essay should focus on expressing and justifying your opinion on whether AI robots will replace all jobs in the future. Discuss the potential of AI, its current capabilities, and the implication it could have on employment rather than discussing the benefits of traveling. The current content is entirely irrelevant to the provided prompt.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**:
   - The current essay lacks coherence with regard to the task, as the paragraphs are based on an off-topic premise. The ideas jump from talking about reasons people travel to specifics such as transportation while intending to convey the benefits of traveling. Within each paragraph, there's an attempt to link the sentences, but due to a mismatch with the task, the overall logical progression suffers. To maximize cohesion, make sure each paragraph has a topic sentence that addresses a part of the prompt, followed by supporting examples and evidence related to AI and jobs.

3. **Lexical Resource**:
   - The vocabulary is appropriate for the topic you are discussing but doesn’t apply to the topic you should be writing about. Phrases such as ""advents of current features"" and ""enhance the in-depth of knowledge for the layman"" are misplaced in this context. If discussing AI, you'll need more specific terminology about technology and job markets, like ""automation,"" ""machine learning,"" or ""technological unemployment.""

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**:
   - There are noticeable grammatical errors, such as sentence fragments and incorrect use of transitions (e.g., ""In the before time,"" ""First and foremost benefit is that it helps""). Correct and varied sentence structures would contribute positively to conveying your argument more clearly.

**Overall Suggestions for Improvement**:

- **Topic Relevance**: Ensure you understand and address the question fully. Spend time brainstorming ideas about AI and jobs before starting your essay to ensure topic relevance.
- **Focus on Structure**: Begin with an introduction that narrows down your position on AI and jobs, then develop paragraphs with clear, focused arguments supporting your view, and finish with a strong conclusion.
- **Grammar and Vocabulary**: Work on eliminating grammar errors and expand your lexical range related to the topic. Try reading articles or essays on technological advancements to get a better grip on suitable vocabulary.
- **Practice and Review**: Take practice prompts seriously and review feedback to see improvements over time.

**Overall Summary**:

Your essay should focus on the implications of AI in the job market as per the question prompt. While your writing shows a good grasp on coherence and ideas, it should be recalibrated to match the given prompt. Focus on alignment with the question, appropriate vocabulary, and fixing grammatical issues for a better score."
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business.  Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is believed that climate change can cause negative effect on business in some ways while others think that there are some benefits for business. This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on the matter.
	On the one hand, climate change can damage business in certain ways. For example, fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming. According to researchers, the number of fishes has dropped in recent years. They have to change their habitat often to adapt with the water temperature. Moreover, this could also damage restaurants as well, some restaurants which are popular with seafood could have difficulty in remaining the sources. It could slowly reduce their earning.
	On the other hand, people can catch some opportunities when the world is heated up. Firstly, tourism industries can have some advantages from global warming. For instance, most countries that near the equator like Vietnam have to suffer from high temperature especially in the Summer. As a result, people will prevent the heat by travel to European countries which have nice weather. Secondly, businesses that provide electronics and power such as fan and air conditionals. Most people will use those gadgets frequently to cool themselves to refresh their minds as well as their bodies. By that, electricity industries can step on it and expand their business.
	In conclusion, although climate change can impact some drawbacks to the business, there are brighter sides that people can rely on to benefit their business.",5.5,"**Task Response:** 

Your essay addresses both sides of the argument regarding climate change's impact on businesses. You provide examples of negative effects (e.g., the fishing industry's challenges) and potential opportunities (e.g., tourism industries and electronics). However, the focus on these examples could be expanded with more depth and balance. Consider further elaborating on how climate change might provide opportunities, such as creating new markets for sustainable products. Also, it would be beneficial to clearly state your own opinion in a separate, well-developed paragraph rather than just in the conclusion. This would provide a more comprehensive response to the prompt.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**

The essay has a general organizational structure, with separate paragraphs discussing the negative and positive impacts of climate change on businesses. However, clearer transitions and linking phrases between ideas, particularly when introducing your perspective, would enhance the flow of the essay. Additionally, the introduction could be clearer in presenting the distinction and your stance on the issue from the onset. The concluding sentence could also be expanded to summarize the key points more effectively.

**Lexical Resource:**

Your use of vocabulary is adequate but could be improved by incorporating more varied and precise language. There are some inappropriate word choices such as ""some significant lost"" instead of ""significant losses"" and ""prevent the heat"" instead of ""avoid the heat."" Try using more specific terms related to business impacts, environmental sustainability, and climate change to demonstrate a wider lexical resource. 

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

The grammatical structure of several sentences could be refined. For instance, ""fishing industries can suffer some significant lost from global warming"" should be ""suffer significant losses due to global warming."" Also, watch out for subject-verb agreement and the use of articles, particularly with plural nouns and proper nouns (e.g., ""the number of fishes has dropped"" should be ""the number of fish has dropped""). Additionally, the sentence structures seem somewhat simplistic, and attempting more varied or complex sentence forms could enhance your essay.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. Expand the essay to address each side of the argument more fully and balance your discussion. Consider providing more detailed examples or case studies.
2. Clearly state your own opinion in a distinct paragraph, offering supporting evidence.
3. Add more cohesive devices and transitional phrases to improve the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs.
4. Enhance your lexical range by adding specific terminology related to climate change and its economic impacts.
5. Refine grammar and sentence structures, ensuring correct usage of verb forms, articles, and plurals.

**Overall Summary:**

The essay provides a basic response to the prompt, addressing both negative impacts and opportunities arising from climate change in the context of business. However, further elaboration and clarity are needed to strengthen the argument and support your opinion effectively. Improving the lexical range, enhancing grammatical accuracy, and ensuring logical coherence throughout the essay will lead to a more compelling and well-developed response."
"As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who cannot afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Housing, being a fundamental need for individuals, has sparked debates about whether the government should offer it freely for those who are economically disadvantaged. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment.

I approve of the notion that free housing can lead to enhanced societal stability, which subsequently fosters national progress. In many societies, homelessness and housing insecurities plague the population, causing ripples of discontent and disenfranchisement. Ensuring everyone has shelter, a direct impact would be a reduction in street crimes, as desperation often drives people to unlawful acts. For instance, countries with robust social housing programs, like Denmark, report lower rates of vagrancy-related crimes. Additionally, a stable living situation can enhance individuals' mental and emotional well-being, leading to more productive and content citizens. As more people become productive, it contributes to the broader development and prosperity of a nation.

I concur that providing free housing can also result in a boost to economic mobility, paving the way for a more equitable society. When people aren’t burdened by exorbitant rents or the threat of eviction, they can allocate resources to education and skill development. This alignment of priorities leads to a more skilled workforce. For example, in nations where housing is heavily subsidized, such as in certain Nordic countries, there is a higher percentage of the population pursuing higher education and vocational training. As these individuals climb the socioeconomic ladder due to their enhanced skills, it reduces wealth disparities and fosters a more harmonious and balanced society. 

On the other hand, I disagree with the proposition solely due to the potential strain on governmental budgets, eventually resulting in the potential neglect of other critical sectors. Allocating funds for universal free housing would undoubtedly divert financial investments in other sectors like healthcare, education, or infrastructure. For instance, countries that have attempted large-scale free housing projects, such as Venezuela, faced challenges in managing their budgets, leading to economic downturns. This financial strain can culminate in inadequate facilities, poorer healthcare systems, and compromised educational quality. The eventual outcome might be a society where housing is free, but other basic necessities and quality services become scarce or subpar.

To sum up, while the merits of offering free housing are significant in fostering societal and economic growth, it is paramount to weigh these benefits against the potential strains on a nation's resources.",5.0,"### Task Response:
Your essay provides a comprehensive response to the prompt, presenting a clear position on the issue of government-provided free housing. You have addressed the prompt well by discussing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposition. Furthermore, your arguments are supported with specific examples, such as situations in Denmark and Nordic countries, which strengthen your position. However, while you have effectively presented a balanced view, the essay lacks explicit expression of the extent to which you agree or disagree in the introduction and conclusion. Clarifying this could strengthen the overall task response.

### Coherence and Cohesion:
The essay is logically structured and the progression of ideas is clear. Each paragraph focuses on one central idea and is well-developed. You have used cohesive devices effectively, such as ""for instance"", ""additionally"", and ""on the other hand"", to link ideas and arguments smoothly. However, the transition between the argument for housing and the counter-argument about economic strain could be enhanced for better coherence. Consider using a transitional sentence between these paragraphs to further improve the flow of ideas.

### Lexical Resource:
The vocabulary used in your essay is varied and appropriate, demonstrating a good range of lexical resource. You have effectively incorporated less common vocabulary such as ""vagrancy-related crimes"", ""economic mobility"", and ""exorbitant rents"", which enriches the essay. Minor improvements can be made by ensuring the consistent usage of high-level vocabulary and exploring more synonyms for commonly used words to avoid repetition, enhancing lexical density further.

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
You have utilized a good mix of simple and complex sentence structures appropriately, with only minor grammatical errors. Sentences are clear, and punctuation is well-managed throughout the response, aiding the reader's understanding. Continue to diversify sentence structures to showcase more grammatical range. For instance, including conditional sentences or passive structures more frequently could enhance the grammatical complexity.

### Suggestions and Improvements:
1. **Clarify Position**: State your level of agreement more explicitly at the beginning and end of the essay to provide a clearer overall perspective.
  
2. **Enhance Transitions**: Improve cohesion between supporting and opposing views by using transitional sentences or phrases to make the argument flow smoother.

3. **Expand Lexical Range**: Further diversify your vocabulary by using synonyms to replace common expressions or repeated words to enhance lexical richness.

4. **Increase Grammatical Variety**: Experiment with different types of sentence structures beyond the typical complex sentences to demonstrate a broader range of grammar.

### Overall Summary:
Your essay presents a well-argued response to the prompt with a clear position, supported by relevant examples and logical reasoning. While your coherence, cohesion, and lexical resource are strong, there are opportunities for slight improvements in clearly stating the extent of your agreement and further diversifying both your vocabulary and grammatical structures. With these enhancements, your essay could communicate its message even more effectively."
"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it's very important to recycle things like a plastic and glass and reduce the waste of it by teaching children. However, It's a highly debated topic, Some believe that it should be taught by schools and others think that it might be more effective if learn at home by parents. This essay will discuss both points of views further. I firmly believe that, Children should be aware and learn about this at the institution.

On the one hand, some group of people agrees that like other learnings, the value of recycled material and rubbish should teach at the house. In light of the fact that, Child always learns anything first at home to other places. For instance, one research held by the World Health Organisation in 1998 resulted, babies are adopting habits such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. From their parents and guardians while spending time with them. Therefore, they argue that home is a good place to learn about recycling things and waste.

On the other hand, I would stand by the former view that an institution is a more effective place for aware children to grasp habits of reuse the things. Firstly, It's well established fact that, students more listen to their teachers to parents. Secondly, They can learn from other peers by watching them. Last but not the least, If schools provide learning through practical examples, then children can more retain information for a long time. For example, One recent European study demonstrates that, Learning at school is far more impactful than home.

To conclude, People may vary in their opinion, I strongly believe that learning about reducing a waste and recycling a rubbish to children in schools are a more efficient way to home.",9.0,"**Task Response: Band 5**

The essay addresses the main parts of the question, discussing both perspectives about where children should learn about recycling—at home or school. However, the development of the position is not entirely clear or well-argued. There are relevant ideas, but they are not sufficiently developed, and the main point sometimes lacks clarity. Examples are used, but more precise evidence and reasoning are needed to strengthen the argument.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 5**

The essay has an evident structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but the overall progression is not completely logical. The opening sentence could be more engaging to set the stage for the discussion. Some linking phrases are used, yet the transitions between and within paragraphs are not always fluent, and the relationship between ideas is occasionally unclear. Overuse of certain cohesive devices (e.g., ""on the other hand,"" ""firstly"") makes the essay feel mechanical.

**Lexical Resource: Band 5**

The vocabulary is basic and there are noticeable inaccuracies in word choice (e.g., ""reduce the waste of it,"" ""grasp habits of reuse the things"") which occasionally obscure the meaning. There is some variety in language, but the essay relies heavily on repetitive structures and phrases. There is potential to demonstrate a broader range of vocabulary with more precise and varied expressions.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 5**

A mix of simple and complex sentences is attempted, but errors are frequent and sometimes impede meaning. Grammatical issues, such as subject-verb agreement (""it's a highly debated topic,"" ""students more listen""), improper use of articles (""a plastic,"" ""a rubbish""), and punctuation errors, affect the fluency and readability of the text.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**

1. **Task Response:**
   - Clarify your position in the introduction and make sure it aligns with your conclusion.
   - Provide more balanced and detailed arguments for both sides, supported by specific examples or evidence.
   - Avoid introducing new information in the conclusion.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - Use a broader range of linking devices to create smoother transitions between ideas and paragraphs.
   - Adjust paragraph structures to ensure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea.

3. **Lexical Resource:**
   - Expand your vocabulary by using synonyms and varying expressions to avoid repetition.
   - Focus on precision and appropriateness of word choice, particularly for key topic terms (i.e., recycling, waste).

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
   - Work on basic sentence structures to reduce errors, particularly with articles and subject-verb agreement.
   - Vary sentence complexity while ensuring grammatical accuracy, practice by writing more complex sentences and examining variety in sentence types.

**Overall Summary:**

While the essay makes an attempt to address the prompt, it suffers from structural inconsistencies and linguistic inaccuracies that affect the conveyance of a coherent argument. Enhancing the clarity of the main points, broadening lexical usage, and improving grammatical precision would lead to a more compelling and comprehensible essay. Consider studying high-quality essay examples and practicing essay writing regularly to develop these skills further."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools

 or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","It is believed by some that sending youngsters to single-sex schools can bring many disadvantages later in life. Meanwhile, many parents choose to send their offspring to these schools because they think that it is more beneficial to them. In my opinion, this can have many negatives. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.

To begin with, sending children to single-sex schools can make it hard for them to learn how to interact and cope with the opposite sex . To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that spending time with kids of the opposite sex is essential and can facilitate the development of youngsters' communication skills. Moreover, they can learn how to interact and be members of one group and work as a team. Therefore, sending offspring to a single-sex school can make it harder for them to cope with children from the opposite sex. 

Lastly, if young boys go to a different school than young girls, then the quality of their social life in the future can be damaged. For instance, scholars reckon that when kids from both genders go to the same school and spend time together, they can learn about their differences and cope with them. As a consequence, they are more likely to have a successful marriage and it will be easier for them to find friends from the opposite sex when they are adults. This shows that there are many benefits to encouraging boys and girls to interact with each other. Thus, sending our offspring to schools that accept both genders will be more beneficial to them and their social lives. 

To conclude, it is reckoned by some that sending kids to schools that accept only boys or girls can cause issues for them later in life. In my view, this statement is completely true. Given the current circumstances, it is best to encourage kids from both genders to interact with each other more often.",8.0,"### Feedback

#### Task Response: Band 7

The essay appropriately addresses the prompt, presenting a clear position that supports the notion that attending single-sex schools can have negative consequences for individuals later in life. The argument is well-developed with relevant examples but can sometimes generalize without exploring other possible perspectives in depth. To improve, consider addressing potential benefits of single-sex schools to create a more balanced argument.

#### Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8

The essay is logically structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. The progression of ideas is easy to follow, and cohesive devices like ""To begin with,"" ""Lastly,"" and ""To conclude"" are used effectively to guide readers through the argument. However, there is some repetition, particularly with the phrase ""sending youngsters to single-sex schools,"" which could be varied to maintain engagement.

#### Lexical Resource: Band 7

The vocabulary used is generally appropriate for the task, with some less-common words and phrases, such as ""offspring,"" ""reckon,"" and ""facilitate."" Nonetheless, there are areas where vocabulary could be more precise or varied. For example, the repeated use of ""sending youngsters"" might be altered with synonyms like ""enrolling children."" Some expressions also feel slightly unnatural, such as ""cope with the opposite sex.""

#### Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 8

The essay demonstrates a good range of grammatical structures, including complex sentence forms and appropriate use of punctuation. While there are minor errors, such as a missing space before the period in ""cope with the opposite sex .,"" they do not hinder comprehension. Overall, grammatical control is strong.

### Overall Suggestions and Improvements

1. **Task Development**: While the argument against single-sex schools is clear, consider addressing counterarguments to strengthen your position. Explore any potential benefits of single-sex education and then refute them, which will showcase deeper understanding and balance.

2. **Lexical Variety**: Use a wider range of synonyms or rephrases to avoid repetition. This will keep the reader engaged and demonstrate a richer lexical resource.

3. **Precision in Language**: Ensure that phrases accurately convey your intended meaning. Some expressions, such as ""cope with the opposite sex,"" might be more effectively communicated with phrases like ""interact comfortably with.""

4. **Grammar Review**: Continue to refine grammatical accuracy by reviewing minor punctuation or spacing errors to achieve perfection.

More and more people these days work harder and longer hours and have no time for family life and friends. What are the causes in your opinion for this? How is it affecting family life and the society as a whole?,"It is true that people have increasingly put in extra hours at work and therefore had little time for their families and friends in recent years. This essay will discuss the possible causes in my perspective for this growing trend and also suggests the possible consequences that may result in both personal life and  society.

There are several causes for people working harder and longer hours in today's world. First, since the world's population is still increasing in huge annual increments, at around 80 million per year, with scarce resources and opportunities, people are having to contend with each other harder than ever before, especially in densely populated areas. This means that if a person doesn't work diligently, he or she will be susceptible to unemployment and not be able to feed his or her family.Second, spending more time working can offer a number of benefits to workers in the company. For example, by leaning into a frenzy in the workplace, a worker can be viewed as productive or being sought after, creating a sense of status for him or her.

Consequently, the trend can affect individuals and  society to a certain extent. Being overly concerned about work can impair other important aspects of life, including relationships with family members. For instance, some successful managers have divorced many times or have not been able to watch their children grow since they don't spend time with their families. In addition, spending too much time in the performance zone could give rise to various mental health problems, such as burnout or stress, leading to productivity loss as a result. Recent research and studies conducted have indicated that productivity decreases for employees who work more than fifty hours per week because of inadequate recovery time.

In short, I believe that overpopulation and self-recognition have caused employees to spend longer hours in the workplace and neglect family relationships. This may result in burnout and stress, leading to reduced productivity and spoiling family relationships.",6.5,"### Feedback

#### Task Response

The essay addresses the prompt adequately. It accurately identifies some causes of people working longer hours, namely overpopulation and the pursuit of self-recognition, and explores the consequences on family life and society as a whole. However, the essay could be further developed by providing more depth and additional causes, such as economic pressures, technology advancement leading to work accessibility, or organizational demands. Also, mentioning specific societal impacts beyond personal and family life such as community engagement or social development would enhance the discussion.

**Band Score: 7**

#### Coherence and Cohesion

The essay is quite coherent, and ideas are generally organized logically. The essay employs cohesive devices such as ""First,"" ""Second,"" ""For example,"" and ""Consequently,"" which assist in the logical flow of ideas. However, the introduction could be connected more clearly to the body paragraphs, and a summary of points in the conclusion could strengthen cohesion. More consistent paragraphing, particularly within the body paragraphs, would help improve clarity and readability.

**Band Score: 7**

#### Lexical Resource

The use of vocabulary is effective, and the essay makes good use of a range of terms related to work and its effects on family and society. Words such as ""overpopulation,"" ""self-recognition,"" ""burnout,"" and ""divorced"" are used accurately. However, the essay could benefit from more varied word choice to prevent issues of repetition and to better convey complex nuances. Additionally, the term ""overpopulation"" may require explanation regarding its direct influence on individual work hours.

**Band Score: 7**

#### Grammatical Range and Accuracy

The essay demonstrates a good command of grammatical structure with a mix of simple and complex sentences. Despite mostly correct usage, some sentences run on and lack punctuation (e.g., the first sentence of the second paragraph could be split for clarity). Additionally, there are some minor errors in punctuation, such as missing commas after introductory phrases e.g., ""First,"" ""In short,"" and ""For instance."" Ensuring grammatical precision, such as adjusting punctuation and refining sentence structure, would enhance clarity and communication.

**Band Score: 7**

### Overall Suggestions and Improvements

1. **Expand on Causes**: Consider delving deeper into additional reasons why people work longer hours like economic needs, work culture, or digital connectivity.

2. **Discuss Broader Societal Effects**: Explore further societal impacts beyond family relationships, such as community involvement or economic implications.

3. **Incorporate Examples and Data**: Use specific examples or data to strengthen arguments, particularly when discussing effects on productivity or providing context for assertions made.

4. **Improve Cohesion**: Enhance the logical flow and connection between paragraphs. Summarize points in the conclusion more clearly to reinforce the essay’s key arguments.

5. **Variety in Vocabulary**: Avoid repetition by incorporating a wider range of synonyms and related terms where appropriate.

### Overall Summary

The essay presents a well-structured response to the prompt with relevant points and adequate development. Improving the exploration of additional causes and effects, enhancing paragraph coherence, and introducing more lexical variety and grammatical precision would elevate the essay to a higher band score. Overall, the essay communicates effectively but has opportunities for further depth and refinement."
"Although families have influence on a children’s development, factors outside the home play a bigger part in their lives nowadays.

Many people feel that the home no longer plays the largest role in child development. In my opinion, through outside factors can affect on them. In this article, I want to express my views. And also, which idea can more correct.

Families have a direct impact on children. First of all, children grow up at home with their parents at least 15 years old and they repeat the behaviour of their parents. And also, children’s personalities are formed at home. Children do not have much access to new technology in their early years. If parents make time for children and love them, kids run towards them. In my opinion, the kid who is friends with her or his parents and vice versa, they can be successful in the future and external factors can never affect.

In conclusion, despite the technology, but families play an important role in the future of children.",7.0,"**Task Response: Band 5**

The essay attempts to address the prompt's question about whether families or external factors play a more significant role in children's development. However, the response is not fully developed. The writer presents a view on the family's influence but does not convincingly negate or integrate the role of external factors sufficiently. The essay lacks a clear stance or argumentative depth, and certain points are underdeveloped or too generalized, such as the assertion about children's success being linked solely to parental friendship without substantial supporting evidence.

**Coherence and Cohesion: Band 5**

While there is a basic structure in place, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, the organization of ideas lacks clarity and coherence. The transitions between ideas and sentences are abrupt, and some sentences are disconnected from the main argument. The essay would benefit from more effective use of linking words and better paragraph development. Furthermore, some parts read more like a list of ideas rather than a cohesive argument.

**Lexical Resource: Band 5**

The vocabulary used is quite limited and often repetitive. Some phrases or words are used inappropriately or awkwardly, which affects the overall clarity of the essay. The essay could benefit from a wider range of vocabulary and more precise language to articulate the complexities of the argument and ideas. Additionally, there are some errors in word choice, evident in phrases like ""due to outside factors can affect on them.""

The essay provides a response to the question about teenagers engaging in unpaid community work during their free time. However, the response lacks depth and is underdeveloped.

This results in a lack of clarity about the writer’s full argument and stance on the issue.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**
The essay struggles with coherence and cohesion. There is an attempt at an introduction, but it is not well-structured or clear in its purpose. The points introduced are not well connected, and there is a lack of logical progression in ideas. The essay ends abruptly, further affecting the cohesion. Transitions between points and sections are absent, making it difficult to follow the writer's line of reasoning.

**Lexical Resource:**
The essay features limited vocabulary and some misuse of words, which affects the clarity and precision of expression. Words such as ""juvienile"" and ""lessure"" are misspelled, and phrases like ""few ethic thinks"" are confusing due to inaccurate word choice. There is also a repetitive use of simple vocabulary, reducing the essay's lexical range.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
The grammatical range is limited, with simple sentence structures predominantly used. There are frequent grammatical errors, including the omission of subject-verb agreement and punctuation issues, such as ""im totally agree"" instead of ""I totally agree."" These mistakes hinder the overall readability and meaning of the essay.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Task Response:** Develop your position with fully-formed ideas, supporting details, and examples. Ensure that both advantages and potential drawbacks of teenagers doing community work are explored to give a balanced perspective if necessary.
2. **Coherence and Cohesion:** Create a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Use transition words to link ideas effectively and guide readers through the argument.
3. **Lexical Resource:** Expand your vocabulary by reading extensively and practicing new words in context. Double-check the spelling and usage of words.
4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Review basic grammar rules and practice using varied sentence structures. Use tools or resources for proofreading to catch errors in punctuation, capitalization, and sentence construction.

**Overall Summary:**
The essay presents a viewpoint on the inclusion of community work for teenagers but falls short in developing a comprehensive and coherent argument. Improvements are needed in task response by providing more detailed support, cohesion by structuring the essay clearly, lexical resources by using a wider range of vocabulary appropriately, and grammatical accuracy by refining sentence structure and grammar. More practice and careful revision can help enhance the effectiveness of the essay."
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, almost everyone can afford to join the internet from any point in the world. However, not every source of data is the truth, there is much disinformation by which ordinary people can be misguided. No doubt that the power of control over informational recourse should be and depends on its spreading and influence on people. 

Firstly, there are many online forums, courses and conferences during which person can catch wrong ideas or be deceived by following the pieces of advice that dominate there. For instance, in Russia many poor or even rich people buy various guides in order to be on the lap of luxury. At last, people lose their invested finance, which fluctuate between 1 thousand and several million rubles, time and sometimes even health and accommodation because of the loan on study. 

Secondly, such examples show the significance of informational regulation from the government. It can be implemented by installing some restrictions through internet providers, with legal responsibility for disobeying. To demonstrate, in China the external and internal web is filtered, all messengers, content platforms are banned or under control from special structures. Therefore, it prevents misleading news and other provocative material from becoming popular. 

Taking everything into account, at modern time information around us will be coming more and more available, bringing about the increasing probability to be misguided or deceived by fake news.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Historical literature has been gaining attention in many societies. Though in some regions, there is a growing number of individuals who are becoming curious about knowing about the history of the place where they live. People want to reach some goals by doing this, however, this is a hard task to achieve. 

There may be several reasons why someone should explore the past years of their house. Firstly, it has been considered leisure for many individuals, especially in the UK. For example, those who live in an old building that has been refurbished  a number of times are the most interested in learning about its past. More importantly, some old houses that once have been hosting a famous author or a public figure could get the public attention, so they can become a source of income for the owner. Likewise, homes that well-known barons and saints had been living there a long time before until they have died, so they attract a few visitors these days.

As for the ways that someone could find out about the history of a place, there are only a few resources available. One way is to seek out the remaining documents regarding the information related to that place. For instance, archived newspapers and phonebooks that may be still present in some libraries. Besides, trying to directly ask the prior owners about their ancestors to find out who was the first owner. Such as looking at families' old pictures and their possible documents.

In summary, the curiosity of people and seeing the history of their house as a leisure activity are the main reasons why someone may seek the past of their living area.

The essay does address the first part of the prompt by discussing reasons why people may be interested in the history of their house. However, the second part of the prompt, which asks how people can research this history, is not fully developed. The essay provides a couple of methods but lacks depth in exploring these options. To improve, make sure to elaborate more on research methods and possibly include specific examples or technologies that could aid this research.

**Coherence and Cohesion:** 
The essay is relatively coherent and presents a logical progression of ideas. However, some transitions between ideas are abrupt, such as moving from reasons to methods without a clear linking device or transitional phrase. Additionally, some sentences are lengthy and would benefit from being broken down into simpler, more concise segments to improve readability. A more systematic structure with clear paragraph division would enhance the flow of the essay.

**Lexical Resource:**
The vocabulary used in the essay is adequate for the task, with some attempts at less common expressions. However, there are a few awkward word choices and expressions that could be smoothed out. For example, ""those who live in an old building that has been refurbished a number of times"" could be rephrased for clarity and precision. Try to incorporate more varied and precise vocabulary to enhance your argument effectively.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
The essay demonstrates a range of grammatical structures, with a mix of simple and complex sentences. Despite this, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as improper use of past tense, misplaced modifiers, and awkward phrasing. For instance, ""homes that well-known barons and saints had been living there a long time before until they have died"" can be improved for clarity and tense consistency. Ensure that punctuation is correctly used, especially commas, to enhance the reading experience.

**Overall Suggestions and Improvements:**
1. **Expand on Research Methods:** Provide more detailed discussion and examples for how people can research the history of their homes. You might explore modern technologies such as online archives, local historical societies, or genealogy websites.

the best way to solve the world's environmental problems is increase cost of fuel for car and other vehicle. to what entent do you agree or disagree?,"some people believe that raising the price of fuel for all vehicles is the most effective way to tackle the current environmental crisis, although this will bring remarkable results, I suppose that there are many feasible measures that the government can impose.

On the one hand, increasing the price of fuel is a possible solution to the world's environmental issues, this is mainly because fuel-powered vehicles contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, the fact that the government increases the price of gas can lead to the residents reduce to use vehicles, this will cut down on greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. However, I hold the belief that a rise in fuel prices is likely to cause locals to become increasingly resentful of their government's policies, which could hamper them from adhering to the law of the state.

on the other hand, I do not believe that increasing the price of gas is the best way option, it is not a sustainable measure this is because that not sufficient to tackle those issues. In other words, the state should lay a solid foundation of education for inhabitants, For example, the state should encourage residents to use clean energy such as wind, solar, and nuclear, as those fuels will emit fewer greenhouse gases. there are several nations, in recent decades, that rely solely on such energy to sustain their economies. Consequently, those countries contribute to the mitigation of global warming and other ecosystem menaces.
